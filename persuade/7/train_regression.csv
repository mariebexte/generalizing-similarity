09ECF76CBD3C,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. In other words, teachers believe students should continue learning after the school year ends. Some might argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed so the student will have the ability to learn over the summer. Summer projects should be student-designed because this will allow the student to have more free time, it will allow less stress for the student, and they should decide for themselves stuff relating to the project.

Summer projects should be student-designed because this will allow the student to have more free time. For example, the student will be able to catch up on sleep or exercise. Students would be able to relax a little more and enjoy their summer off. Students will feel more energized and healthy. Students will feel better about themselves. Students will feel more relaxed instead of stressed. Students will feel more calm.

Summer projects should be student-designed because it will allow for less stress for the student. For example, the student will feel more calm and the assignment will not be as hard for the student. The student will be able to concentrate more. The student will most likely complete the assignment as this will lead to less procrastination. They can work with a friend or group. This could lead to the student not having as much stress as they will be working with a friend. This could help relieve stress.

Summer projects should be student designed because they should decide for themselves stuff relating to the project. For example, the student could decide if they want to work alone or with a friend or group of friends. This may allow the student to have more communications with their friends. This will help the student complete their assignment at hand. This could help students think about what they wanna present for their project when they return to school. This allows the student to make their own desicions. This will help them learn to be independent.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because this will allow the student to have more free time, it will allow for less stress for the student, and they should decide for themselves stuff relating to the project. Some might argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed because this could help the student learn. If the summer projects are teacher-designed, then the student will not have any free time. Overall, this will give the student a lot of free time.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
AC70BEFCB732,"During summer break, it's a time in which the majority of kids are outside enjoying themselves at the pool,beach, an amusement park, or a new country they've been waiting to visit all year long, but for some kids, however, they are required to complete boring summer long projects that are designed by teachers in order to further develop their education.

When you think about these summer long projects, many of them are designed in a way that makes them a struggle for students to enjoy doing themselves while they're on break, the majority of teachers design these projects as a way of continuing with the development of their students education, but don't put into thought what a student might be doing over the summer and how their project can relate to the activities they do. Some teachers may say that no matter what the students do over the summer, the main goal is to continue with the development of their education, which is completely understandable, but what point is there if these projects are designed in the interests of teachers and not the students.

A summer project isn't something many students enjoy doing, mainly due to all of the months spent in school, but when they're allowed to work on a project with the topic of their choice, or on a project that reflects their summer break, many students would feel enthusiastic about doing their summer project and at the same time, students would feel better with themselves when they make their own decisions in a project rather than have a teacher make the decisions for them and have to follow their guidelines in regards to the project.

In a student's perspective, a summer long project that's designed to improve their education may sound boring to them since they just got out of school, but if students were able to design their own projects and freely decide what their projects would be about, it would be a whole different story. When students are given the freedom of deciding what they want their summer projects to be about, they are capable of understanding the way they express themselves,see their true potential, and further understand how to develop their education based on their strengths and weaknesses.

Schools should consider letting their students design their own summer projects, as a way of helping them develop their education and learning skills. When students are given this opportunity, it's more likely that the student will enjoy working on their project, complete it, and see their academic advancements as they continue to work on their projects.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
65980B1BCBAD,"Why are student-designed summer projects beneficial?

School is important for everyone. The law is that everyone who is born in the United States must attend school. School is a time where you study to get good grades, develop strong bonds with teachers and friends, and having a fun time. During the school year, students get to choose what classes do they want to take. After students select what classes they want to take for next year, they usually get summer assignments or summer projects to prepare them for the upcoming school year. In other states, summer projects or summer assignments are either teacher-designed or student-designed. I always preferred that summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the student to have creativity, an easier way to self-study, and it engages the student's learning.

Doing a project brings astonishing ideas to a student. When the teacher gives a simple task to do a project by using tri-fold display boards, construction paper, and color; it gives the student the freedom of what they want to create. Students grow a mindset of what will help them. Some students do well by being creative because some of them are visual learners. Visual learners understand materials by looking at a specific picture to capture the concept, so it can be a part of their memory. When creative students start coloring; it gives them less stress. Less stress causes to work faster and gives relief, and it helps them to make a nice presentation. Creativity also brings the teachers attention when it's time to present. Teachers will see that these creative students took their time to make a neat artwork and helped them to understand their assignment by designing it themselves.

Self-studying prevents the student to be behind. Self-studying can be hard at first, but once you understand how to do it and manage it; therefore, it becomes easier. Studying by yourself doesn't make you re-read, highlight, and memorize the textbook the whole day. Use different ways to study such as doing projects, making flashcards, or teaching it to a friend. Most of these self-study learners make detailed projects to make it enjoyable for them, and it can make them motivated. For example, you are taking an biology class in the fall. Your assignment says to make a project that makes you notice nature. You come up with a brilliant idea and make a bird feeder. You use creative ideas along the way such as making a bird feeder out of an old milk carton. After that, you put half of the seeds inside and the other half on the ground. To observe your data, you would see which type of birds came to your feeder, what time, and what day of the week. This shows that you noticed nature by motivation and self studying by making data.

During the summer, students learn new material for their future classes. When learning about new knowledge during break, it makes students more engaged. Students don't have a deadline when they can study, so they take it easy by doing it step by step. Since some students get bored over the summer, they get curious to find new things. There are students who make their own projects to see how intelligent they are in that subject. By making projects, students have the will to discover their learning path. They have the time to go out to different museums or national parks for ideas for their project. They notice what they can establish in their future life by observing areas, so then they research more to make their summer project even better. The students designed their own projects by having the time to explore around themselves, making experiments, and taking risks. All of this helps them to engage their learning.

In conclusion, projects should be student-designed because it allows the student to have creativity, an easier way to self-study, and it engages the student's learning. Making summer projects that are student-designed helps learning grow and makes teachers proud of what their students can accomplish. Student-designed projects give no procrastination, spend more time with friends, and manages your time easily. This is why student-designed projects are more beneficial than teacher-designed projects.       ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
2187FAAB11BD,"The idea of summer projects for students is a great way to assure that they are continuing to learn outside of school independently. This is true when the students have the freedom and responsibility to choose which subject they want to deepen their knowledge about. Although teachers have the ability to design specific projects that relate directly to the curriculum, students would find completing their projects more enjoyable if they had the freedom to research a topic that they experienced first hand, as well as displaying an opportunity to those who travel and may research different cultures.

Schools that allow the students to design their summer projects may include a list of topics provided by teachers to assure all students remain on task with the curriculum as well as develop a passion for their topic. With a list of examples provided, students may get creative with ideas and become passionate about their work, which should be the most important goal schools attempt to get their student to achieve. With passion, students become motivated to continue studying even when it is summer break.

Moreover, those fortunate enough to travel have endless possibilities when designing their projects: from the chemical makeup of jet plane fuel to the traditions and customs of villages in third world countries, there is no limit. By being able to experience new cultures, examine pieces of art work, sight see great monuments, etc..., students may design extravagant projects that expose others to what they have experienced. When students present their project at the beginning of the following school year, those who did not get to travel may learn about topics they weren't able to experience themselves, making all students inclusive in eachothers summer activities.

Although some may believe that teachers should design the student's projects, this should not be the case if schools wish for their students to learn to be responsible and independent. If teachers were to design the projects, yes, it would be guaranteed that it follows the curriculum, but there will be a clear lack of passion in the student's work. Forcing a topic students have no interest in or are unable to experience first hand will bring the students to resent learning during their break. And for those traveling, some may not have access to specific requests the teachers assign, forcing them to either return home to complete their project or to produce something mediocre. Students being able to design their own project that works best around their schedule would benefit everyone.

Schools who allow students to design their own projects are giving the opportunity to be creative, independent, and responsible. With passion mixed in, possibilities for greatness are endless. Schools that have teachers design projects should reconisder and follow the schools that allow students' footsteps.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
425D3E01C3F4,"Summer projects can be a helpful tool for both teachers and students to ensure that students will be ready for the next school year and not forget what they learned the previous year. Summer projects should be enriching, creative, and fun for students. While a student-designed project may be creative and fun, it would most likely lack the enrichment component which is the whole point of having summer projects. Ultimately, teachers know better than students how to prepare for the upcoming school year, which is why these summer projects should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed.

Student-designed projects may sound like a good idea at first, but students would not be able to create a project that would prepare themselves well enough for the next year; at least not the same way teachers can. Students are already unmotivated to do any summer homework let alone projects. However, there is definitely an appeal to creating your own projects, which would help motivate students to complete and do a good job with the project. Most likely though, if students were given free reign to design their summer project themselves, they would take advantage of the opportunity and make a project that is too easy and in the end, unhelpful. This outcome would be even worse than just doing a teacher-designed project which would actually help students.

Teachers know exactly how to prepare students for the next year, so although their project may be harder and not as fun, it would pay off in the long run and help students develop important skills they would need for the next year. Because the goal of summer projects is to make sure students are learning over break, teachers tend to focus too much on the content of the project and often do not make the project creative or fun. Often times, a teacher-designed summer project will be to read a book, analyze it, and write an essay about it. These types of projects are not fun for students, and the result would be a clear lack of effort from the student. I myself have experienced this, and know firsthand that students need to be interested in the project to ensure quality work. In order to avoid this and cater to students creativity, teachers should design multiple projects for students to choose from incorporating various skills such as art, writing, or research. This way, students have a choice and can pick whichever project they would have the most fun doing.

Ultimately, teachers know what they are doing better than students, and can make summer projects fun for the student while also helping them continue learning for the next year. Teachers can always get feedback from students and implement new ideas on how to improve the same project to make it better for the next year, whereas students would not be able to do this. With having more experience and knowledge, it is best that the design of summer projects be left to the teachers. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
39A822883189,"Summer projects created by students .

Students should be able to design their own summer projects because they could use their prior knowledge and creativity. Knowing some of the knowledge will make the students dive deeper into the material and learn new things. Creativity allows students to think outside the box and explore beyond technology. Giving students the responsibility of choosing their own subject would make them interested into doing their project and enjoy making it.

Students should do their projects based on what they are most familiar with. It would make it easier for them to do a project based on what they already know, so they would most likely start it immediately. They could also search through the web for new information. They benefit from it because they get to learn new material and are able to use it for the project. Although searching through the web is easy and fast, they could also visit places related to what their subject is about and collect new information from the place they visited. They can learn by being physically there and understand deeper by doing hands on work.

Creativity allows them to think outside the box. Depending on the subject, they could experiment new things. They could use their mind freely and do whatever they would like to do. For example, teachers would be strict about what they would like the students to do and use but since you are free to be creative; you would be able to organize the information however you want it to be organized and how to introduce your project. Your project will be made up of your personality. If you want vibrant colors, dull colors, a variety of information, less information, pictures, or no pictures;it is all up to you. You get to express yourself with your project.

In conclusion, if you let the students portray their projects in their own unique way. They will enjoy creating their project by using their creativity and prior knowledge. They will learn during their summer break and also be able to express themselves through a project. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
A996BE4B49FA,"Certain schools make students complete a summer project to make sure students are still learning over their summer break. There is an ongoing debate over if teachers should design these projects or if students should. Some believe that the student should design the project because it is their summer break and it gives them time to be creative but this is not true. Teachers should design the summer project, not the students.

There are a variety of reasons why teachers should design the project. Teachers purpose in this is to make sure the students project is educational and will benifit them in the long run. A teacher is a professional and will most likey pick a topic that will help them through the summer untill they get to school. Students might pick a topic or design their project on something that might not benefit them significantly educationally. Along with teacher design would come clear and formal instructions. Provided the teacher designs the project the instrustions should be crystal clear and students will be on the right path and most likely less confused than if they had to do it all themselves. Teacher design will aswell booost the project in looking more formal provided rubric can show expectations that need to be met. When teachers provide a project for their class, everyone has the same assignment, and it not only makes it easier for them but the students. This makes said project still formal but everyone can add their creative skills making it more personal giving it their own twist. With the same summer project and teachers permission, it would aswell be easier to work with others and share ideas. Teacher design benefits the students.

There are further reasons on why teachers should be the ones designing students projects. Teachers know what will benefit the students, preparing them for their next year. Edcationally they will design a project based to fit their class and that will help their students. This is teachers being hard working and picking themselves what is best for their students. As stated previously everyone having the same project would benefit the teachers aswell. Multiple projects after a long summer is hard to grade but with everyone having the same assignment and rubric it would make it easier for the hard working teachers. The teacher deciding and designing how they would want their project would asvwell be a plus for them. They decide how they want it as well as theirs expectations, which makes it clearer for the student to unerstand as stated previously. Teachers designing the summer/schiool year projects benefit both students and teachers.

The summer project should be designed by the teachers and not the students. There are many reasons why teachers should design it, for example it makes it easier for both the teachers and the students in the long run. those who disagree state that it would make it easier, more creative, and fun for the students but realistically this is not true. School work at anytime of the year should be designed and given by the school, this puts order in the school system.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
3B27DB9B21FE,"Schools should have summer projects be teacher-designed because teachers will pick projects that they know will be usefull to students, teachers put their full time and effort, and teachers will also make the project enjoyable to the students.

Teachers have created many projects for many of their students, making them have a lot more credibility than students to construct a project. Teachers will know what information will be on the project makin it easier for them to construct projects that they know will be of use to students in the future. They all have insight on what a student should learn and what a student should not learn because they have been teaching all year long to students. They would take out all the useless information because they know how to filter it out, while students are learning themselves and will not know how to identify usefull information from useless making teachers more credible on the projects that would be assigned to students. Teachers can also make this project very clear and precise so that students will not get confused on what to do, how to research it, and how to write it professionally, unlike students who always go out of their way to make the project more lengthy and the basis of the project a lot more confusing to understand. Teacher know about the main ideas or concepts about these projects while students are unaware of these main ideas because they are yet to learn about it.

So many teachers put so much time and effort into teaching their class everyday for an eight-month period, which makes it easier for them to create projects because they are so comfortable in this type of creative/learning environment. They put maximum effort to make all this information very precise and straight to the point while students usually, when it does not affect their grade, slack the work load by doing creating he project half-heartedly and not with their full time making the learning experience for the students researching the project also not as fulfilled to learn. When people make it seem like they put their full effort into teaching you about something, that sense or feeling that they invested a part of time into making your learning experience a lot more impactful, you are more compelled to study and learn about what they are teaching you and telling you to pracitce, which is what teacher do and are meant to do. Teachers will always have the time to give out and make projects because that is their job and they have to take it serious unlike students who either creating the project is not fulfilled to do their part or students just do not have the time of day to invest their time into projects. If students do take an investment of time to create these projects, they will not be able to focus on the other important things that they have to get done.

Teachers also have a way of making learning a lot more fun and interactive on their daily teaching schedule, therefore, making them have a way to encapture a students attention into making these projects a lot more enthusiastic and enjoyable to research on. Teachers also make the projects a lot less objective based learning, teachers want to make sure that you understand the content to its fullest extent while also maintaining a curiousness towards the basis of the project, unlike students who make the project seem very boring, uninteresting, and very objective based learning which will make students to never research anything about that certain topic again because they could not learn anything fun about it or there was no interactiveness between the students and the project they were assignes to.

In short, teachers have a better advantage and a lot more insight on how to design these projects because they know what information that will be of use to students, they put the maximum amount of time and effort, and they make the learning experience more enthusiastic and enjoyable to the students doing research on them. Teachers always seem to have the upper hand about how to pass off knowledge and wisdom because of these reasons.  ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
80B1CEEC5860,"Grades are everything to students, even more so to students who want a bright future. Those students always turn in everything and always do thier work. Even those types of students get bored too. Students want something fun and interactive, and matbe they will actually enjoy school. Children, just like adults, don't want to do something they don't enjoy. The goverment actually requires kids to go to school and only miss 14 days of school each semester. Them making kids go to school takes the fun out of it. Then there are the teachers, some make school great and others not so much. Therefore, kids get themselves into trouble. They don't do it because they're bad kids, they do it because they're bored and wanna have fun. Then kids skip class, to hang out with their friends, or they just skip school all together. Some even get into fights, just beacuse they're bored and want to do something. Students don't like doing hoemwork, or class work, either. They like it least of all when they have to do it over summer break, but if we let them make up their own summer projects they are more likely to do it, have fun, and be creative.

To begin, students don't want to do homework or projects, but if we give them a little trust and freedom to make their own project, they are way more likely do actually do they project. Kids don't like to be told what to do. The solution is to let them do what they want to, for their own projects. They come up with the concept and the idea, that makes sure that they are interested in it. A great example is, if you tell a teenager to make a project for science class, and they want to make a video game, let them. They can program a very low level game during the summer, and when school is back in session they can show they class and everyone can play it. Not only does this help that kid learn new skills and learn about science, but he can feel a sense of pride when people want to play his game. Some also say that playing video games can help them learn about certain classes. Just like, how minecraft can teach you a lot about earth science, a kid playing minecraft and trying to find ways to fix bugs with in the game, can help him learn skills for his programming class. Students are more likely to do a summer project, if they can create it themselves.

Secondly, children need to be creative. This day and age creativity is even more important then it ever has been before. For them to be successful, they need to be different and think differently than others. They have to stand out from the crowd. Letting students make their own summer projects can help them do just that. Letting kids create something, not only benefits them now with a better grade, but benefits them later in life too. They learn that nothing that you love doing will be easy to achieve. That you have to really work at it, no matter how small it may seem. Students will most likely create something they love and can do it themselves. An example is, a student loves to bake and her english teacher told her class that they had to make a project on the book they just read, Romeo and Juliet. This student decides she is going to make the balcony sence, where the two characters are just talking. That student did something, she really didn't want to do, and turned it into something fun. That girl got to do soemthing she really loved and challenged her self to make soemthing so big. Children need creativity, so why not let them do their own summer projects?

Last, but not least, kids need to have fun. They aren't going to do something that isn't fun. Kids aren't goin gto do something they can't pick. Thats like your parents forcing you into dance and you really hate dancing, but really love writting. Your not going to want to go to dance, you going to try everything to get out of it. Having fun is apart of life and if you never have fun, how are you suppose to enjoy life? People have fun in different ways, every person gives fun a different meaning. One kid might think partying is fun and another might think playing sports is fun. The point is, to enjoy not only a school project, but life, you need to have fun. If we let the students pick their own summer project, than they will have a much better time doing it. Isn't that whats most important? For everyone to have fun and not push it off, or just not do it. A good example of this is, a swimmer, a person who loves to swim competitively, does a science project on the human body. The project is on how the depth of the pool can effect your sleeping habbits. The student is going to have much more fun doing that instead of some stuffy, old project her teacher gave her. Students need to be able to have fun, letting them choose their own summer projects guarintee that.

On the other hand, everyone choosing thier own projects, will make it harder on the teachers, to grade. They have not thought about, the students. Making it easier on themselves, doesn't make it better for their students. Teachers giving everyone the same projects doesn't make it fun or interesting. It makes it harder, because you want yours to be different, but the chances of that are really small. Then when they get back from break, they don't get that sense of pride and they can feel poorly aboout themselves. Teachers must let students make their own projects, not only does it help them have fun, be creative, and actually do the project, but it also helps them figure things out on their own with no help. That skill has to be taught somehow, why not through a summer project?

In conclusion, students should design their own summer projects. This not only helps them now, with a grade, but it also helps them in the future, with very important skills. Teachers are going to have a harder time to grade these projects, but isn't it worth it? Teachers are here to teach students to be ready for life. Students don't like homework, but they would if they want to, having fun, and being creative.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
B82896DAE7D6,"Most students look forward to the last few days of school, those last few moments when the bell is about to ring and they can all go and hang out, or just go home and relax. After a whole school year's worth of work they are ready to take a nice break. But then those hopes are ultimately hurt a little when a teacher announces that the students are to complete projects over the summer. These projects should be student designed because of the work being assigned over vacation, giving the students a chance to self-govern themselves, and because they will have extra free time to work with.

Some teachers would agree that if the students were to assign themselves projects, nothing would get done, or the students would not learn anything new. This really should not matter in the long term as the teachers already have enough control during the school year, and the students really should be allowed a break from all this learning. If the students do not get the break they might need, than what is the point of a vacation?

Speaking of that vacation, students need that time to relax and unwind, preparing themselves for the next year. Some parents might even have big vacation plans over the summer to take their families interesting places. This means that a student will have to work his or her summer homework around the vacation time, which, in some cases, can be really challenging. One student might have a big project to get done, but their parents announce that they are taking a family vacation to Germany for a couple of weeks. Of course, this might not seem like a lot of time, when school stops, that does not mean everything else does as well. These students might have jobs to keep up with or other responsibilities outside of school, these projects just make things even harder than they need to be. When you give students a larger window to finish something, they get the chance to improve their leadership skills, either in a group, or with themselves.

Students who design their own projects will get the chance to self-govern themselves, meaning they have more time to make creative decisions that can improve the project, rather than just having a week or so to finish it where they might rush it, or cannot dedicate enough time outside of school to get it done in time, lowering the overall quality. When students get to make these creative decisions, they can make the students think in new ways and bring out more interesting decisions to make the projects stand out a little more. All of this culminates in the extra free time the students have to think, execute, and produce a well-made product.

The extra free time gives students more freedom to try more ambitious projects without the pressure of all the work that needs to be done within a week. The project will be able to develop naturally over time. If teachers assign these projects, then either the student will feel less compelled to do it, or it will not turn out as well because the student might not want to do that type of project in the first place. This extra free time is a great source for creativity and good student led projects because the students will be more compelled to do the work right, rather than just get through it so they can actually enjoy their break.

Overall, these students would really feel bummed if they were required to do extra work over the summer for seemingly no reason at all, other than to continue learning. With student-designed projects, students will still get to enjoy their vacation, while learning more about self-governing, and making good use of their extra free time. Going to school is not something that everyone in the world enjoys, but is required, so if the teachers are really going to strip away some of the student's free time, at least let the students be in control. If you give the children more freedom, the creative results may be beyond anything you have ever seen.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
44E91CBF4115,"Summer school projects should be student lead because they allow students to keep their brain fresh, achieve a goal, and understand new concepts. School projects over the summer should be student designed. This allows students to keep their brain active, have a goal to accomplish, and learn new things. Projects to complete over the summer are a good tool for schools to use to keep their students ready.

Some students might think a project for school over the summer is tyranny, however, keeping your brain thinking is very important. An interesting project, that should be mainly student-designed so completion is high, is a good brain helper. A benefit of the project will be once the students go back to school, it'll be easier to jump back into familiar topics because your brain has had a refresher recently. Freshman year of high school I had an English project over the summer on Mythology which greatly helped me when I returned to school and Mythological stories was our first unit. Overall, keeping your brain up-to-date is an excellent way to be confident in your schooling career.

During summer break a lot of kids end up being bored at home just watching TV or playing video games. A project, designed by students so the kids can stay engaged and interested, could shake this monotony and give the student a goal to accomplish. Goals are important and they lead to the person feeling good about themselves once they complete said goal. On the other hand, a student might say how they don't need a goal to stay active during the summer but they can always benefit from something to hold them accountable so just in case the student starts heading on a downward trend, the goal can lift them up and set them back on track.

Learning new things is an important task to do often. Having a student lead project is a great strategy to allow kids to find and learn new things, explore new concepts, and complete tasks efficiently. Kids learning new things over the summer with a rigorous yet interest-grabbing project is an excellent way to expand the classroom horizon once school is back in session. It allows the teacher to make new teaching decisions such as what projects will look like in the future, what kind of strategies to teach with, and if said teacher can branch off into side topics that they usually couldn't branch off into.

In conclusion, school-assigned projects should be student-designed so interest and completion is high, goals are made and completed, and the students' brain is kept in top shape. The ability a kid has to learn by themselves over the summer should be tapped into by schools more often. Projects to complete over the summer are a perfect tool to keep kids fresh and ready for when school starts back up.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
23096C10E52A,"Schools now are requiring their students to complete summer projects to assure they are learning and maintaining the knowledge gained in the past school year. Though there has been some contemplation as to whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Students should design their projects because it will be in their skill set and the students will be more likely to complete it because it will be in their field of interest. However, there should also be some restriction as well. Students should only get to design their project if the teacher approves of it before hand.

Every student has their own interests and things they like to do, whether it be in or out of school. With projects being in their particular field of interest, they will be more inclined to learn about the topic and complete a project on it. Kids who are more interested in animals and nature might not be as interested in a project about space or robotics, therefore not being as excited to do it and there is even a possibility of them getting a bad grade. From experience in a previous project I completed on manatees, I was interested and wanted to research the topic I chose. Projects that fit best to my interests where more fun and enjoyable, and allowed me to complete it on time while having lots of information on the topic at hand. These projects are also being completed during summer, a time when students are enjoying their long break. A project that is fun and to their liking will help the student get it done quicker and better. Students interests are sometime lost in the teachers decision, therefore they should acknowledge that students all arent the same and allow their students to design whatever project seems the most eye-catching to them. In the end, it makes a more excited and focused student.

Along with students having different interests, they also have different skill sets as well. There is a wide range of courses and topics that each and every student does well with while others find more challenging. For example, a student could have a hard time in a math class while another thrives. Being a student myself, knowing that I would have to complete a project that i'm not as familiar and skilled at would stress me out to the point of not completing it. During summer most students use that time to relax from all their hard work during the school year and by adding on a project which doesn't align with their skills will cause them to feel panicked and overwhelmed to get it finished on time and have all the key elements. Projects should showcase what a student knows to their class, teachers, and sometimes family, but when given a topic that is far more challenging, they are less likely to complete it to the best of their abilities.

One reason why there is controversy on whether the summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed is because the learning aspect of the project could be lost. Students will design projects that will not be connected to the curriculum or non-educational, therefore not allowing the student to learn as much. However, there are ways to avoid this problem. One way is to get the teachers to approve of the given project. In their decision they will hold true to the students interests and skills and help guide the student to design a more adequate project if needed. This will decrease the amount of non-educational projects that some students might come up with and also include the students main interests and better skills, which is often lost in a teacher-designed project.

The requirement of summer projects has much controversy on whether the students should chose their project themselves or the teachers. With the students being able to do so, their certain interests will be included and their skills will be showcased. However, there would be an issue of students picking projects that won't be as educational as the school intended for them to be. To avoid this problem, teachers would approve of the given project, lowering the amount of non-educational projects while also having the student be excited and focused to do the project. In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed, but only if the teacher approves of it.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
4C6BB0618D7E,"Should summer projects be designed by teachers or students? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure they are still learning during their break. The most simple thing to do, is to have the teachers design the projects, but why not let the students think for themselves. My take on this, is that students should have to put a little effort in, for once. Summer projects should be student-designed because they deserve some freedom, can show off their intelligence, and will help them develop life skills.

Some may say teachers are more educated and have more experience; That might be true, but how are the students supposed to get a real experience if they never get to design their own project. My friends like when a teacher gives the class a project that is already planned out. The reason they enjoy this is because they are lazy and do not have to do any work. Teachers know a lot of information which should be passed on to their students. Although, that statement is true, when do the students get to pass their information to the teacher?

Student-designed projects give the kids freedom in what they choose to do. At my old school, the students would have to read one book in the summer and then write a report on it. All my classmates would be so happy because they had the choice to read whatever they wanted. A teacher once told me, ""freedom is a gift; We do not get that gift often and it is a mistake."" This means, students are rarely given any freedom and all that does is limit them.

Student-designed projects would help teachers see how intelligent their students are. In

Kung Fu Panda , Master Shifu learns from watching Po move around the kitchen, that he has plenty of skill. In that scene, the master learns how much potential the student has by watching him do his own thing. In middle school, we would do our summer projects based on any news topic we read. This allowed the teachers to not only get an idea of who the students are, but also show them a baseline of how smart they are, as well.

The projects that students self-design will help them develop life skills. A student creating a project on their own teaches them responsibility and problem solving. The student will have to find a solution to their topic, which shows responsibility by being able to complete this task well enough, to receive a good grade. My father believes summer projects he had to create on his own assisted him to where he is today. My dad thinks this because it showed him time management, which is a life skill students will need forever.

Summer projects are meant to help students continue to learn over a long break. Although, why not make summer projects have more value? Instead, schools can help the students do more than just learn over break. Summer projects should be student-designed because they should have choice, will show off their intellect, and assists them in developing life skills. The school systems need to work together, to take action on making student-designed projects a priority, for getting students the best education. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
782EF1136565,"I personally think these summer projects should be student designed. Over the summer a student such as myself is so focused on vacation or summer activities we forget whats going on in school. We as students and growing teens need to keep our brains active and focus on education even if it is during the summer. Although teachers may need things to keep their brains or teaching skills active it is more important that the student knows given information due to the fact that teachers have already been through the school system. Over the summer I find myself getting very distracted and losing lots of information doing a project based on school related subjects can help me stay on track.

When a student is on summer break or vacation the burden of school is lifted from their shoulders and their brains become less active. Students can go to bed later and hang out with friends more. These distractions can cause information gained during the school year. In my personal experiences with losing information I find myself learning simple concepts again taught to me the prior year. Keeping your brain active is one of the most important things that can be done by the student in school. Even though teachers need to do the same students are held more accountable.

Even though retaining information can be difficult it must be done to obtain the greatest amount of success. This is exactly why a project can be so useful to keep information fresh in their minds. Growing teens need some type of mechanism to reserve and retain information. Teachers have already done this many times considering that they have been through high school college and completed all the requirements of becoming a teacher.

Also teachers have finished school they no longer need to do tasks such as projects. Though they also can lose information it is way less likely to happen. Teachers have already made their way through the education system. A project to them would be to easy and simply pointless. The said project could be made more difficult for the teachers to give them an actual challenge but overall teachers would easily surpass them.

In conclusion I strongly think that students should be given a project to turn in the following year. Some teens just dont hold information as well and need something to keep their minds set on school subjects. Teachers would easily complete this task so I dont think the assignment should be necessary for them. Im sure almost any student can complete said project with ease as well due to the amount of time given. ",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
C0459F75A8DB,"Most schools in the United States require students to complete a summer project. Projects are assigned over the summer to assure students are learning over the long break. Most students want to enjoy their break without any school work and wait until the last week of summer break to complete summer projects. This is why summer projects should be student-designed. If summer projects are student-designed, students will be more creative, it gives students a senses of independence, and students will be able to explore areas of interest.

However, some may disagree and say summer projects should be teacher-designed. They argue for this because if projects are student-designed they may off topic. This is a valid argument because it would make no sense if a student in a science class did a project about Fredrick Douglass. This could be avoided if teachers made guidelines for students to follow. Nevertheless, their are other view points to consider.

On the other hand, if summer projects were student-designed they would be more creative. Students would not be restricted and could express themselves in unique ways. In the last few decades or so, the government has made standards for students to meet. With theses standards in places teachers have to follow a very strict curriculum. More than ever before, teachers are teaching to the test which limits student creativity. With student-designed summer projects, students can express their creativity which they are limited to in the school year.

In addition, allowing summer projects to be student-designed would let students to feel independent. As most students are restricted during the school year to a classroom, allowing students to design their own projects could mean they go to a local park and explore their community. In Tara Westover's memoir

Educated , as a young girl she did not explore her community as a child due to her parents beliefs. As she grew up she wanted to go to college and experience something new. When she went to college it was very rewarding. This is because she was not restricted any more. Allowing students to design their own project could be a very rewarding feeling for them because of the independence they gain through it.

Finally, if summer projects were to be student-designed it would allow students to explore areas of interest that may not correlate to a specific subject in school. If a student wanted to do a project about fast fashion, it does not make sense to do it in a world history, algebra, biology or band class. That is why it is beneficial to students if they design their own summer project. A student-designed summer project allows students to research a topic they might not be able to do in their classes during the school year.

To conclude, letting students to design their own summer project is beneficial in more than one way. Students will be able to show off creativity that they might not show off in school. Student-designed projects gives students a sense of independence because they are not being told what to do. It also allows student to explore topics that are not taught in school. Student-designed projects have many benefits and could even lead to a career path in the future.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
F8B12D60AEDC,"Summer projects should be student-designed as long as the teacher is still in control of the overall process. This system engages the students more, while also ensuring that they continue to learn over the break.

As a rule, students are more likely to complete an assignment and enjoy doing so if they have control over the parameters of the assignment. If a student is interested in a certain field of study, they should be able to freely explore and learn about it. Designing their own assignment would allow them to do this. For example, one student might be fascinated with astronomy and another student with biology. Allowing them to create their own projects to study these fields would pique their interest in learning and may also help them understand which career field might suit them best.

However, with a student-designed project, it is possible that the student will ""slack off"" and design a project that does not truly benefit their learning. For example, a student might design a science experiment that with the research question of ""what is the effect of temperature on ice?"" Although this question sounds valid, it is not since it is easily answered. Most people already know that ice melts as the temperature increases. Therefore, the student will not have to put in much effort or even conduct the experiment in order to know the outcome.

In order to prevent this from happening, teachers should supervise the designing of these projects. This can be done before the students leave school for the summer or the students can submit project proposals to the teacher over the summer. If teachers do this, they will be able to verify that their students' projects are possible and refine them. Often times, students have good ideas, but do not know how to execute them or are unable to because they do not have the necessary resources. Teachers will also be able to catch the projects that are too ""obvious"" or easy.

Although student-designed projects can go awry, they can also be very successful if they are created with the guidance of a teacher. Students should be given every opportunity to learn on their own and explore their individual passions.       ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
F83B719757F6,"Summer homework, one of the most scary phrases said by any teacher. Many schools and teachers require projects to be completed over the Summer to keep topics fresh in students minds while the students are on break. While this train of thought does make sense, these projects should be designed by the students. It is unreasonable to think that students should work around the teachers schedule during the summer, as if they hadn't been doing that the entire school year. Student designed assignments would allow the children to continue their learning while still being able to go on vacation and work at their jobs. It would also allow them to become more engaged with what they are learning, as they would be be in the drivers seat of their learning, making it more enjoyable. It would also let the teachers get a better understanding of their students and where their level of comprehension is with a certain topic. Student designed projects would allow for the students to learn, while also allowing them to have fun during their break.

Typically, when teachers assign homework over the break, they schedule due dates and assignments when it is beneficial to them, and not quite as much as the students. Giving the power to the students to make their own time line to help alleviate the stress of the projects, makes the assignments seem like less of a chore and helps them learn the content. A couple years ago, a teacher of mine assigned our class three books to be read over the summer. The first book had to be read by the end of June along with a quick report. Too bad for me, I was in Italy with my family, that I hadn't seen for a year, for the month. During the vacation I was barely able to spend time with my family as I was trying to read the assigned book and write a report. Because of this teacher designed summer assignment, I missed quality family time and rushed to finish my report. These restraints that wouldn't have happened if the schedule was student designed, caused me to not learn anything because I was too rushed, and also made me lose time with my family. If students were able to design a schedule for their assignments this would take away the stress that comes along with set due dates.

Another thing many teachers like to do, is to assign ""busy work."" Teachers assign busy work just to be able to say that the students are learning and working. During the Summer, Teachers often assign busy work to meet the schools requirement of a summer project. Often times this includes long packets, that students simply have to complete. They are extremely time consuming and non beneficial to the children. For example, let's say a science teacher requires the students to complete a project on the different bird species of the region. One student might really benefit from a book about the birds and learn from it, but another student is more of a visual learner. With a student designed project, the first student could read his book about the specific birds, while the other creates a project on the different species he sees around his neighborhood while documenting what he sees. Summer projects shouldn't all be the same, because everyone is different. If students were able to control how they were learning, everyone would be able to create a project that works best for them, which makes it easier to understand what they need to learn.

Many might think, that the teachers don't benefit from student designed projects, and this plan just reverses the stress to the teachers. But, not only would student made projects be beneficial to the children, it would also be beneficial to the teachers as well. Student made projects would allow teachers to gauge where each students level of comprehension of a certain subject/topic is and where each student needs a little extra help. Let's say a history teacher lets their students create a project about the government branches. One student writes about all of the branches of government but leaves out the fact that the President is a part of the Executive branch from their project. The teacher now knows what they should review in the upcoming school year. Since the project is in control by the students they are able to learn what they want and how they want, this freedom allows the teachers to help the students learn even further as they now have a better understanding of what the children's strengths and weaknesses are. While these students were learning about history their teacher was learning about them.

Leaving the students in charge of their summer assignments, benefits all those involved, from the teachers to the students. It lets students feel more relaxed during the break while also allowing them to learn at their own pace and more effectively. It allows the teachers to get a better understanding of where their students are so they can grow as teachers by knowing what the kids struggle with and how to improve in the future.

So, if teachers are required to give students Summer assignments, hand the keys to the kids and let them drive.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
C236576483D8,"Over the summer, many student spend their time doing nothing to keep their minds active and engaged in education. Many schools and teachers want children to continue creating learning experiences and mentally developing over the summer. One way they can do this is to assign a summer project for a student. While many of these projects might be created and outlined by the teacher, I personally think that Students should design and create their own individual projects because it would help them to grow as independent learners, it would allow them to create something that they would be enthusiastic about and would put more effort into. and it would also help the teacher see more clearly how effectively a student is progressing as a learner.

One important reason that summer projects should be student designed is the fact that creating a whole project from scratch would help a child to become a far more independent learner, and would prepare them for their later stages in life. When a student reaches college, it would be pretty overwhelming for them to have to take a bunch of classes that were all almost completely independent if they had never been given the opportunity to grow in their independence as a person in middle or high school. A student designed project might be quite scary for many students, but I think that it is definitely necessary in order to be set up for long term success in their personal endeavors throughout their later years in education, as well as their career afterwards. Many jobs are highly independent and require for somebody to be diligent in their own efforts. For example, my dad is an engineer, and he has deadlines that are agreed on by him and the people that pay him for completing work for them, and if he doesnt meet a deadline, the client would most likely not be happy and never come back to get more work done from him.

Another big reason that summer projects should be student made is that it would allow for students to be more creative, and work on something that they are very enthusiastic about, which would in turn make it easier for the student to work hard and do well on the project. If a student is assigned a topic that they completely hate, they would be extremely unenthusiastic about the project, and would definitely not want to work on it, especially during the summer months, when there are so many other things they would rather be doing. It would probably lead to procrastination on a project that would leave a student with not enough time to properly do the project to the best of their abilities. A project that a student is enthusiastic about could also lead to a student feeling confident in their abilities, and they would be encouraged to try their best and do well throughout the year to keep their positive momentum flowing.

It would also be extremely helpful for a teacher to be able to see how a student is functioning and is progressing on their own terms. At the end of the day, the teachers job is to guide and lead us until we are independent enough to thrive on our own. If the projects were self designed, it would be an extremely helpful tool for future teachers to look back on and guage how much work a student needs on their independence journey before they can leave without facing struggle or uncertainty throughout their life. These self designed projects would help a teacher to clearly see each level of assistance needed by each and every student.

All of these reasons that argue that projects should be student designed revolve around one thing: independence. I think that independence is the single most important thing that you have to prepare for in order to be ready for college. If a student was not independent in college, they would flounder around without being able to properly learn and develop the skills they need to succeed after college. Middle and High schools need to take steps towards challenging their students with independence to create self-sustaining, educated people that can truly help to make a positive difference throughout their communities and make the world a better place.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
82EB399A8961,"As the school year ends and summer break begins, many students cease to learn or do any education-related activities. Some schools require their students to complete summer projects to assure that the students continue to learn over the duration of their three-month summer break; however, there has been an ongoing debate on whether these summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Those who disagree state that these summer projects should be designed by the teachers, but this not true. Although some may disagree, the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed.

There are a variety of reasons that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. One reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that by allowing students to design their own projects, the students are able to demonstrate their ambiguity. For example, a student may have interests in a particular subject and may do a project that is displayed through an ambiguous media platform. That project format would not be able to be displayed if the projects were designed by the teachers. Another reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that by allowing students to design their own projects, the students are able to be creative with their projects. A student may want to be creative and show their ability to carve marble statues, or their ability to do ventriloquism. In another instance, a student may want to be creative with their project topic and may want to conduct research on a rarely known species of insects that they learned about while visiting South America during their summer vacation. In addition to the aforementioned reasons, students should be able to design their own projects because it allows students to learn more about a topic that interests them. A teacher designed project may inquire about a student's knowledge of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus or Newton's Laws; however, these topics wouldn't interest many students and the amount of precision and thought put into the projects would be lackluster. By allowing a student to control their project's topic, the teachers are giving the students freedom to roam and think about what they are going to learn about.

There are further reasons that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. When a teacher allows a student to choose a topic for a project, it allows the teachers to understand a student's level of learning, as well as a student's level of thinking. Most students will be appreciative of the fact that they're able to conduct a project of their choice and will give their best effort while completing the project. As a teacher grades a student's project, that teacher is able to gauge what the student was thinking as they created their project. Another reason that these projects should be designed by the students is that when a student is given the freedom to conduct their own research for a project topic, that student is able to give a demonstration of their innovation. Many students have strong innovation skills, but during the school year they are assigned different assignments that prohibit students from using their innovative nature. For example, if a student has an interest in airplanes, they may want to do a project pertaining to airplanes; teacher-designed projects would not allow a student to explore this area of innovation within themselves, which may cause them to lose interest in the topic. One more reason that the projects should be student-designed is that by conducting one's own research and designing one's own project, a student may explore new topics that may peak their interest. For example, while researching the hardships and difficulties of underwater welding, a student may learn about another profession that they did not know existed. This simple occurrence may sway a multitude of that student's life choices: which major they will pursue in college, which profession they may want to pursue after college, or if that student may still want to go to college after high school instead of going to a trade school.

Although some may disagree, the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be student-designed. Those who disagree state that the summer projects that some schools are requiring students to complete should be teacher-designed, but there are a plethora of reasons that this is false. These projects should be student-designed for a multitude of reasons: students are able to be more creative and ambiguous when choosing their own project design, students are able to be more innovative when choosing their own project design, students are given the opportunity to learn about new topics, and when students are given the chance to design their own project, teachers are able to gauge students' thinking and cognitive skills levels. By allowing a student to design their own project, that student is bound to become a more independent thinker and innovator; thus, creating a brighter future for the generations to come.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
8D1BE4C96059,"A lot of schools in America require students to do summer projects to make sure they are exercising their knowledge during the 3 month break, some schools believe they should let the students choose the project they are going to complete, some schools believe they should let the teachers decide what the students will do.

I believe the students should decide what the project will be, because the summer should be a time where students are taking their break off from school, so the teachers might give the students a really hard and long project that takes a lot of effort to do not knowing how it feels like, so i believe the school should get ideas for what project they will be giving out to the students from the students, choose their favorites from that list so the students dont pick something that is too easy and gives them barely any knowledge out of it, and then let the students vote for what they want to do.

An example of this is at a school in Dubai, where they placed a closed box in every class and let everybody get a peice of paper, write their idea down, fold it and then put the folded peice of paper inside the box,than they open all of these boxes and pick 50 different prompts, then they make a survey and make every student vote for what they want to do out of these 50 different prompts, the one with the most votes gets chosen.

In conclusion, every school should let the students control some of the decisions made, it gives them more freedom and makes them feel like they have a say on whats going on in their lives instead of letting other people decide for them.",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
F614B9D35C09,"Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Summer projects should be student-designed to keep it simple. Teacher-designed projects are usually time consuming, boring, and complicated. The summer projects should be fun, easy, and less time consuming for students. Students wouldn't want to do a project that could take up their entire summer break; they don't deserve it. The summer projects should be student-designed because they are able to decide how much time they want to spend on it and how easy or creative they want it to be.

Summer break is the time students are off from school. If they were to have teacher-designed projects, it'll make them feel like their still in school. Students are supposed to enjoy summer break, not be focused on a project given by a teacher that could stress them out. Most times, students don't do the project at all for reasons like: "" Oh it's boring"", "" I didn't have time"", "" I couldn't understand it"", or "" It's too much work"". Teacher-designed projects are not right for students, especially since it's over the summer.

Student-designed projects will allow students to have an enjoyable summer. If they create their own project, they have control on what they do. Students will still be learning by themselves with what they decide to create. If the student does not want to spend the whole summer working on the project, it will be okay because they're the one making the decisions. The students can make their project easy and fun with things like: Colors, Pictures, and Glitter. Students will be able to enjoy their summer break because their project will be fun and easy for them.

Everyone has their own opinion for these two choices. If it were to be discussed by teachers only, they would most likely choose teacher-designed projects. If it were to be discussed by students only, they would most definitely choose students-designed projects. Between teachers and students discussing it, it would basically be a 50/50, but the teachers should really give students the chance to create something and learn on their own. It's best for the summer projects to be students-designed to have it easy on them.  ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
AF05AA1A49DA,"Summer is a time for students to take the stress off of school and to have fun with their friends. Some schools think kids should still have projects throughout the summer to continue their learning. Each school is different, some schools have the teachers come up with the project, while others lets the students make it. Schools should have teacher-designed projects for the summer because it would get students ready for what they will learn that year, teachers could count it as a grade once school starts, and it would be an easy project that would not take too long to do.

If a teachers got to come up with the project they make it on the one of the topics the students would learn that year. They know what they will be teaching, so they would make the projects on specific units to prepare you for the class. Doing this is great because it will get the students ready and interested into the subject early on. This will help the students for when they start school they will already know a little about the topic. The more students know to start with the better they might do in the class.

Another great thing is if the teacher designed the project, then they could count the project as a grade to get the school year started. This is good because right off the bat the student could have a good grade if they do the project correctly. Knowing this more people, for sure, would do the project. Starting the year off with a good grade can help benefit you later on, if you start to struggle a little bit. The project would be easy, so it would be easy to get a good grade, which is a great way to start a school year with. The more students doing the project, the more students you will have thinking and getting involved in school during the summer.

The teachers would make it a fairly easy project that would not take the whole summer to do. Summer is the teachers vacations as well, and they know as much as the kids do that they want to relax. Lots of kids travel and hangout with friends during summer and teachers know that, so they would make it a pretty fair and easy project. Doing projects like these kids get more involved and excited to do them. If teachers did a simple, and maybe even a little fun, project it would keep the kids thinking and yet not stressed out.

Some might say that the students should design the project. They think this because they say the students could make it their own and they would be more interested if they got to choice what they wanted to do. Although some people say that, if a student got to choice their topic or how they want to do their project they would do it too easy for themselves. Summer projects should be designed by the teachers because it would be on a subject they will learn later that year, the teachers could count it as a grade, and they would make it a simple and fun project to do. Everyone benefits more if the teachers made the projects rather than the students. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
3F03A55FF4C4,"Imagine summer break coming to an end you would want to make memories with friends and family, but you can't because you have to do your summer project. When it comes to summer assignments many students will put it off until the last moment. They will do this for a number of reasons maybe they were on vacation, had trouble with their family, or just didn't like the assignment. Regardless of the reason in the last moments of summer they must rush to complete this assignment for the next school year. Summer projects should be student-designed because of students interest, schedules, and emotional health.

Summer assignments should be student-designed because of different students interest. Some students may be interested in math while others might like science or history more. If a student likes math but is required to do a history summer assignment they will not want to do it because they are not motivated to do something they do not like. Some may say that regardless of what classes students like they will do the assignment anyways because they have to. While that is true it would be better to let the students choose what they want instead of trying to force them to continue learning over summer break.

Students schedules are not always as simple as teachers think so giving a lot of work to do over the summer might not be best for them. Students have a lot going on in their daily lives spending time with friends, sports, religion, and family emergencies. These are some things that constantly impact students lives on a daily basis, and if they are dealing with a lot over the summer they might have difficulties finding time to do the assignments teachers give them. Although most students have a lot going on so it not a valid reason for students to put off their work or not do it. However students know their schedule better than teachers they could design a project that they could fit into their schedules and complete on time.

Students in their teens or lower are often feeling many emotions through the year but teachers probably don't think about that as they assign summer projects. A student getting a project they don't think they can handle while they are dealing with a lot at home could push them to make a bad decision like doing drugs or getting in a fight. Students could be feeling stressed, angry, or sad and getting an assignment they might not think they can handle could make them act out in unpredictable ways. Some may say that getting a project has no impact on a students emotion health. However the fact is all students have different conditions that they live or grew up in so when teachers assign projects they can't assume that all students are fine. If students could chose their own summer assignments they could chose something that would not feel so overwhelming to them.

The whole point of summer break is so students get a chance to relax and prepare themselves for the next school year. While it is important for students to do a little work so they don't forget what they have learned so far, teachers should not force the work on them and they should not feel like it is too much to handle. In the past teachers designed the summer projects and students just had to deal with it but that system is flawed. Does it really help students review what they have already learned? What's to stop them from copying the assignment from a friend. Going forward students should have the choice to design their own summer project with the help of a teacher. While it is best for them to feel comfortable and want to keep learning over the summer teachers need to make sure that it covers the right material and that it is not too easy.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
CAC4E6021973,"Since the birth of the internet and social media, the world has shifted to greatly favor the innovators and the free-thinkers. Society no longer demands students to find one subject they are good at, go to college to study that subject, and then get a middle class job in that field. While performing one skill at a very high level still holds value, the most successful people are those who can think ahead of the curve, those who can think of the next Amazon, the next Netflix, the next Uber, the next big thing. So, how does that relate to whether we have student-designed or teacher-designed summer school projects? Well, letting students design their own projects gives them more freedom, allowing them to think outside the box, which aids the development of valuable skills that are applicable in the real world. Instead of teaching students how to follow directions on a rubric, we should be teaching them to think creatively and how to collaborate with one another.

Allowing students to design their own projects gives them far more freedom than a teacher-designed project ever could. Keeping students on a leash forces them to wear a one size fits all education. Each student is different; they all have different strengths, different weaknesses, different motivations, and different goals. That is why we need to give them tailored education. Giving students this freedom would allow them to create a project that works well for them, and more importantly on a topic they are actually interested in. If we let students do a topic they enjoy, the results will be far better compared to when they are forced to learn about something they have no long term interest in. The freedom students gain from designing their own projects is far more valuable than just following the directions their teachers gave them.

Making students design their own projects encourages them to learn how to think creatively. Arguably, the most valuable skill in today's society is the ability to be able to bring a new unique perspective and thought process to any discussion. That is not a skill that can be obtained by constantly being told what to do and how to do it. Students need to learn for themselves how to go to the drawing board, find out which ideas are bad, which ones are good, and then create a plan to execute the good ones. That is not something that can be spoon fed in the classroom. That's why student designed summer projects are the perfect opportunity for schools to do their part in teaching students how to think creatively.

When forced to come up with their own ideas and think creatively students will develop and enhance skills they would have never had the teacher been the one designing the project. For example, if it is a partner project these two students will have to learn how to collaborate together to design a project, designate jobs to each other, and hold each other accountable for their share of the work. That kind of collaboration never would have occurred had the teacher done all that for them. When students go on to college and into their professional career they will have to learn skills like collaboration, because they won't have someone doing it for them. That is why it is important we take the time to prepare them for than now.

A wise man once said, ""don't follow where the path may lead, but go where there is no path and leave a trail."" I believe that quote perfectly represents how we want our students to think. The skills developed through out of the box thinking which can be achieved by allowing students the freedom to design their own projects is far more valuable out in the real world then anything the teacher could prepare.       ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8

Summer projects, as a student i'm not a big fan. But in the case of this argument, I don't have a preferred side. Either way these projects stress you out on a break made for not having stress. I will not say they are a good or a bad thing because there are so many pros and cons it'd be hard to really choose. But I guess I have to in order to pass.

To start, I'm going to list some pros and cons of these projects then i'll pick a side. Lets start with pros. Summer projects, if done correctly provide some sort of education during the off school season. But usually when they are designed by teachers. Cons, there are a lot, and I have a student perspective so it makes sense. When a teacher makes the project, it requires me to actually use my brain. Summer projects takes time and energy from me. They take away time from my job that I could be out making money. So that is a pretty big con.

Since I have to choose, If anyone was going to design the summer project it has to be the teacher. They understand the curriculum and how to apply it to students. Yea, it'd be awesome if students did it. Then there would be a lot less work to it. Personally it's hard to think of a reason to where a student would want to design it other than personal benefit. I'm not saying that all students would do that. But a large majority would. Students wouldnt even know where to start. They would make up some fake assignment that would take like 10 minuets to complete. Which is great and all but there would be no information transmitted over the course of the summer.

Honestly how can students design a project on information that they don't fully understand. That would be chaos. I understand why summer projects are in place. But if i'm going to be completely honest here, I don't want some kid designing what my task to do over the summer is. I see two things happening, that person will be my best friend or I'd hate their guts. There is not much more to be said in this argument. Hands down, with out a doubt teachers should design the summer projects.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
F8996C605E84,"A student's life should be lived by a student's choice. While there are a select handful of students who yearn to increase their knowledge day in and day out at school, the majority despise it. Due to the lack of free time students are left with after their school day, weekends and breaks are their knights in shining armor that will save them from the prison they call school. One of the breaks most looked foward to is summer break. This three month halt in tests, note taking and projects is sheer paradise in the eyes of students. However, some deem it neccessary to continue the assigned curriculum into this break to ensure the adherence of crucial knowledge to the students' brain. With that being said, these summer projects should be devised in a manner that will benefit both the teacher and the student to the maximum. And so, to assure their continued learning during their break, summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed in order to maximize productivity, to enhance their leadership skills and to allow for students to enjoy their project, and hence, giving them a break.

The majority of students innately have a distaste for following directions and taking orders from higher authorities. As a result, when students are constantly ordered to work on numerous projects throughout the year, they will complete it with reluctance. Furthermore, their lack of desire to complete this project will lead to a lack of favorable content, meaning the students will not complete it to the best of their ability. While the teacher may need to put forth guidelines, in order to prevent the students intentionally procrastinating their assignment and turning in mediocre work, the students should be able to partially lead the prompt for the project. When the students are presented with a project they find interesting they will be eager to present their optimal work despite the activities they may be doing during the break.

Taking leadership and making self-guided decisions are skills that students must acquire at an early age in order to succeed later on in life. Although the teacher may portray a leadership role in the classroom, it is quite difficult for the students to replicate the actions they see until they are given the chance. Allowing for students to make the decision on how they will plan their summer project gives them this chance. Simliar to a teacher constructing her lessons, with a student-designed summer project, the students will have to form an agenda based around curriculum and time provided in order to successfully complete it in due time. Ultimately, students will have to make decisions for themselves and organize their daily life giving them an advantage.

Students grow rather lackidasical when dealing with a mundane routine back to back. During the school year, students spend eight to ten months being bombarded by the same tests and the same essay prompts and the same book entries. Summer break, to them, is an escape from all of that pressure. Although it is neccessary to make sure that students retain the information they acquired that year, the students should be able to decide how the reestablishing of ideas and topics they learned. With guidelines and rules given by the teacher, the students can potentially produce work they are proud of and enjoyed working on.

While it may seem rather bizarre to let students decide their own projects, the idea can be fruitful and beneficial for the students and teachers in the end. When the last bell rings for the year released them for summer break, the students bolt out of their school doors and practically forget all that they have learned. In order to prevent that, many teachers have implemented summer projects to assure the continued learning and retainment of their knowledge. However, during the summer when students are on vacation and living in paradise, the last matter they want to worry about is another project assigned by their teacher. Consequently, the students may potentially complete it without care to discard the thought of having work to do. This is ultimately counterintuative to the purpose of said projects. To fix this possible mishap, students should be able to design their projects with guidelines from their teacher so they enjoy the process of completing it while still enjoying their break, ehnace their organization and leadership skills and produce work to the best of their ability, With this method, the students can retain the information deemed neccessary by the teacher and the teacher is able to see this effort and productivity they put into it throughout the school year.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
C58FBAA7598E,"In my own opinion, as a high school junior at Generic_School; to further your education during the summer, schools should allow student-lead projects to take place. The pros of allowing students to design their own tailored made educational projects out weigh the cons. When you are able to design your own educational project you put more heart into it, then if it was teacher-designed. That extra passion allows for students: to explore different interests, connect with colleges, explore research foundations, and to participate in community service.

Nudged deep in every student thoughts, especially teenagers, is the fact that college is right around the corner. Allowing students to use creativity to there advantage, instead of being left in a box doing a research paper. Gives them a positive opportunity to explore different careers and the majors attached to them. Lets say for a thought exercise, that a high school junior named Generic_Name is going to college, but sadly doesn't know what he's interested in. A student led project, gives him the perfect opportunity to pursue different career fields, to find out what excites him. By the time he graduates from high school, Generic_Name already has a generalized idea of what he wants to major in.

Asking questions is essential in helping to find the right college or university. Creating a student-project for the summer, allows students to connect with both research foundations and professors at different colleges; enabling students to network earlier not later. To better explain my thinking behind this, think for a minute that your Generic_Name, and your doing a project on DNA. By contacting college level professors and other professionals in that field, you not only helped yourself by getting an A on your report, but by networking; when your ready to apply to college and the professors already know you, your chances for getting in just doubled. As a bonus when Generic_Name is looking to get a job or internship; by already knowing professionals in the field, he's more than likely to get his desired position.

With passion comes community service, it's a saying I like to say, time to time. It works like an equation: passion plus creative project, equals community service. The more excitement that you have for a project, especially if you thought of it yourself, puts students in an unique position to voluntary get downed into the trenches of learning. When your learning, you often make the community better than how you left it in the summer. For an example, I recently met a young college grad named Generic_Name; he told me that in high school, his history teacher told him that a team of archaeologists needed volunteers to map an old Civil War battlefield. Sadly though he couldn't, because his English teacher over the summer made him write a mandatory research essay on Jane Austen.

All in all, students should be in charge of there own educational projects during the summer. It's like the old saying, you attract more with honey then with vinegar. Connecting it to a real world application, allowing someone to think rather then to be given; encourages someone to use passion, educate themselves, and put there heart into it, rather then sigh. Plus it's the summer, who wants to read a boring book from the eighteen hundreds!      ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
6AE4BFE2E5CF,"A student's freedom from the limitations of the classroom's necessary rules during the summer provides new opportunities for them to learn in dynamic ways. While, in the classroom, a teacher's control of a regulated learning program is unavoidable in order to teach such a broad audience in such a short time, there are no such factors outside the classroom. The variable shape of a student's summer project provides a unique opportunity for the student's specific educational needs to be accounted for - which a teacher-designed project wouldn't be able to take advantage of. Education during the summer should be student-designed, because the student can pander to their learning style and interest, it can reinvigorate the student with a passion for learning, and it instills a certain independence from adult figures that will be necessary later in life.

Students learn in many different ways. Psychological studies have shown that there are different types of learning, from spacial to audio to visual, and students learn better in some ways than others. A rising awareness of mental health has also led to the understanding that brains process information in different ways, so students with autism or ADHD don't get the same results from the conventional classroom practices. Student-designed summer projects would be able to take all these different specifications into account when structuring the project, so visual learners could visit exhibitions while attention deficient kids could apply whatever technique they need to help them study (listening to music for some, a totally still room for others). The dynamic nature of a student-designed project would be an advantage to the kids who need to learn in a different way from the regulated, cookie-cutter methods that teachers use. As well, a student-designed project could angle more in the direction of what the student wants to learn about. Students are forced to spend hours of a day paying attention to subject matters that they don't care for in order to get a generalized education. However, the point of a summer project is education itself, not education towards the goal of a degree. Students would be able to design a project that deepens their interest in a topic, broadens their knowledge in a niche industry. Education would feel more like a hobby than a chore if a student could account for what they learn and how they want to learn it.

A student-designed summer project would be exciting for students, because the agency over their education would allow them to create highly specified and perfect learning courses for themselves. Going through a program that teaches them in a way that they both understand and enjoy would be exciting and possibly life changing. The modern school system is the most monstrous source of stress on the childhood and adolescent mind. Even though learning should be acknowledged as a privilege, wonder, and necessity, it becomes a burden to students. Between the forced socialization of the classroom environment, administrations that care more for policy than the experience of the individual, a constantly building workload, and a set of rules and grades that are constantly judging and disciplining behavior, schooling becomes nightmarish for students. The poor environment weighs so heavily on the minds of children that they often develop mental illnesses or complexes, and, in extreme cases, are driven to suicide over poor grades (which, in the grand scheme of life, should be menial). Student-designed summer projects would be a way to show students that learning can be a growing and nurturing experience, instead of a murderous one. That change in outlook in the mind of a student could make all the difference in that student's optimism, well being, and quality of life for the rest of their schooling career.

One of the main focuses of school is to prepare a student for adulthood. While school accomplishes that in many ways, it fails to teach students how to truly act independently, because their lives are always in some way being influenced by adults that hold real power. A student-designed summer project would fill this void of education, however, because it encourages students to make choices for themselves and then to carry through with those choices in order to make them a reality. Placing the responsibility of their own education on a student would encourage them to think critically and organizationally in order to create and then implement a strategy. The limitless possibilities of the project, because the design is given over to the student, would teach them how to narrow down vague concepts into specific plans. Even arranging for certain resources to be supplied, depending on the project, would show the student how to control moving parts - whether that manifests in asking their mother to buy eggs from the grocery store or in biking to the library to check out the necessary reading materials. Students are rarely prepared for the autonomy of college and the time-managing aspects of adulthood, because they're used to their parents or teachers doing things for them. Forcing a student to design a project that they then have to complete would be an introduction into the decision making of adulthood.

A student-designed summer project would help students grow, because they could change their views on the operations of education in the span of a few months. They would grow to be stronger learners, more persistent observers, and more assertive leaders. Since life is really a process of learning--whether that means learning skills, academics, or something else entirely--an easy relationship with the concept of learning is the most valuable thing for a person to develop. Student-designed projects are an easy opportunity to encourage and teach that kind of relationship, and students would develop an outlook on learning that would improve the way they interact with the world for the rest of their lives. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
7A347C69D3D1,"Summer projects are a helpful tool to use to gain insight of a student's capabilities and to prepare them for the upcoming school year. Summer projects can be used for any subject or curriculum to help a student for their next courses, whether they are college level or not. Even though summer projects are designed to help students and can be done in a number of ways, it is beneficial to have it designed based on the teacher's curriculum and needs.

Though there are different varieties of how to formulate a summer assignment, having it expand on student skills and help teach a new subject can be beneficial for the teacher. Summer assignments can be used as a review and to help teach a new subject based on what the course is. Having it designed around the teacher's curriculum and upcoming plans allows for students to get a grasp and to expect what will be taught and the level of difficulty the class will be. For example, summer assignments for math tend to review previous subjects that will be used for a harder math course and will help expand on this knowledge. A summer assignment that I have done is one for Precalculus with Trigonometry that not only reviewed previous math skills but expanded on them which helped to prepare me for the course. Students have voiced that these projects are too hard and can never finish them in time. That is why assignments are given at the beginning of summer to allow exponential time to do them and are made in a way to teach and prepare students for what they will learn in a harder course, making an easier assignment will not be beneficial for these reasons. Summer projects can be made with different variations, having them based on a teacher's plans allows for an preparedness and an expansion of skills.

Summer projects are a beneficial tool for all students and teachers, though it is helpful for a teacher in the new year to teach the subject if students have some knowledge about it. Students tend to struggle when going into a new year, especially with classes that are college leveled and they have no knowledge about it or what they may be getting into. For an AP class, it can be useful for a student to complete an assignment and have some indication of what the teacher's curriculum is and be able to prepare for the class or even drop if they feel like they may fail it. I am in college weighted class now, and if it wasn't for the summer project, I can say I could have possible failed the class if it wasn't based on the teacher's curriculum and I could've been entirely loss in the class. Students may say that a summer assignment should be fun and they should be able to pick what to do, but a student picking the assignment will not be beneficial for the teacher, it can cause a teacher to redo their year plans and may be behind on teaching and preparing a student for an upcoming exam. Though students can pick if what and if they want to do the summer project, the assignments being based on the teacher's future teaching plans will allow the student to know upcoming expectations.

Summer projects are a tool to help a teacher, having them designed around the teacher's plans will allow each teacher to know where each student is and know where to focus most in the curriculum. Every student had different previous teachers who teach in different ways and have different capabilities and extensions of learning which can cause a struggle for teachers. For example, my English summer project was to read and annotate a novel so I could write an argumentative essay on it. After turning it in, it became clear to my AP Language Arts teacher that not every student was on the same skill level for writing and that she would have to reteach the basis of writing for different formats of essays; without the summer project she would not have know this. Summer reading assignments should allow a student to choose the book so they will want to read and get the assignment done. Having this choice, students may pick a book that is not on their skill level and can hurt them when doing assignments in the class. It will ruin teacher plans on what each unit will be and what will be taught in said units. Though students are mature enough to choose their assignments and parts for the projects, teachers design them to know more about each student and will be prepared to reevaluate their lesson plans.

Summer assignments come in a variety of ways, but having them based on the teacher's units and plans for the school year will prepare both student and teacher. Summer projects can be used in any subject to benefit the teacher and allow a smooth year for easier teaching when knowing the students skill set and be prepared to change plans to accommodate these. As a student continues to move up the grades and start taking college leveled classes, it is imperative to have some incoming knowledge of the subject and to expand on previous skills. Summer projects can either be student designed or teacher designed, but in the end a student ill benefit only if the assignment is based on the teacher.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
A75EB2F907D9,"Do you really think student's would like to complete summer projects over the summer? Me personally i would hate to even think about having some type of extra work in the summer, why? well here are my three reasons. I know sometimes in the summer, were bored and can't wait to start school. Secondly there's times where we want summer to hurry up and come around, because were drained mentally, physically, and emotionally because of the thought, we have work to finish up, make sure you turn it in on time before the due date and focus on maintaining to keep your grades looking good and not disappointing,. Thirdly, no teacher nor student would like to do a summer project over the summer.

Although, in the summer, were sometimes bored and can't wait to see are friends so were excited for school to start back up and hang out with are fellow peers. Because i know some people can't go out, hang out with friends because their parents are too stricked; or they're furious about letting their kids out at a certain time even though they can have a bed time but some parent's just can't risk anything i'm talking out of experience because my parent's are like that, it's not fun at all. But honestly you'll thank them later on as you get older or when you have kids because, how society now days is set up is crazy! , i tell you.

Then, we started school, for example ""September 4, 2019"" is the first day we enrolled in school then give it a few months into the school year ""January 11, 2020"". let me tell you, the first day of school was memorable, seeing the pleasant faces of missed friends and teachers was probably the best, but as soon you get later into the year it's not so jolly anymore, your're DRAINED the feeling that you just want to drop out, give up, you dress like you don't love yourself because of the amount of stress on school work, the end of year state test's, so you can't help but to say ""I can't wait for summer"" out of your mouth. You feel so relived when the word ""summer"" comes out, you start thinking about all the things you can't wait to do.

After, when you are finished with school, who wants to go home and wants to start on a summer project?? most defiantly not the teachers nor the students, we have been learning for months and i know teachers are sick, tired and cant wait to catch a break, don't get me wrong we need to gain knowledge everyday but after all the months we've been learning and teachers staying after to grade our papers and assign are next assignment when we come in class is a call, a call that we need a break.

To sum it all up. The moral of the story is no, no i don't think teacher's nor student's should be required to complete a summer project over the summer, it's too much for them and i'm pretty sure their brain needs some type of break, you know? vise verse. I hope the schools that require this assignment should think about there decision a little more. Respectfully.                      ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
F197689A74A7,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

Completing a summer project allows students to refocus more quickly when school starts again and ensures that skills students learned during the previous school year remain sharp.

Additionally, the completion of a summer project provides for a phantasmagoria of success throughout the upcoming school year.

However, most of these summer projects are teacher-designed rather than student-designed.

Summer projects should be student-designed because students learn differently, can explore their passion, and can show off their unique skill set.

Obviously, students have different learning abilities and may learn differently from their peers.

For example, students who are classified as auditory learners would not succeed on a hands-on project to continue their education because they prefer verbal explanations or videos to learn.

Additionally, some students are visual learners; they may require to see another person's work in order to complete their own.

Therefore, assigning these students a hands-on project would not be beneficial to their education.

When different learning styles are taken into consideration, it is evident that each individual student is aware of how they learn; consequently, they should be able to devise a project that fits their unique learning style.

Furthermore, assigning a student a project that does not interest them would make completing the project seemingly unbearable.

Students would choose topics that interest them if given the chance to design their own project.

For example, a student who is particularly interested in automobiles would not wish to complete a project on the effects of cow manure on the pollution of waterways.

They, in turn, would not take this project seriously, which would be detrimental to their grade.

Additionally, giving students the opportunity to design their own project would allow the teacher to see each student's passions.

This would benefit both teacher and student because the teacher would learn about the student's interests on the first day of school rather than through awkward ""getting to know you"" activities.

Giving students the ability to design their own projects would allow each student to be excited to explore their interests and present their passions to the classroom when school starts again.

Some would say that allowing the students to design their own projects would cause an issue for the teacher to grade it because each student's project would be different.

However, allowing students to design their own project would give them the ability to show off their specific set of skills.

For example, students who are gifted in vocal music would not succeed on a project that involves woodworking, and vice versa.

Students should be given the opportunity to share their gifts with the teacher so that future projects could be set to their strengths rather than their weaknesses.

On the issue of grading these projects, teachers could evaluate the amount of time and effort that appears to be put into each project rather than using a cookie-cutter rubric.

Students would be more successful on a project that showcases their skills than if a teacher designed the project for them.

Grading these projects would simply take a more evaluative angle from the teacher.

When one considers that students have individual learning needs, wish to complete projects based on their passions, and are more successful completing projects that emphasize their skill set, then one can see that students should be able to design their own summer project rather than complete one that is teacher-designed.

Allowing students to design their own summer project would, consequently, prepare and excite them for the upcoming school year where they would be able to present findings that are unique.

This would then build momentum for the remainder of the school year.

Although projects would prove to be dampening to the students' summer break, completing a project that explores their interests would be less gruesome than a teacher-designed project. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
A9DC409C8EEC,"Summer assignments are known to and disliked by every students that has had to complete these tedious tasks. Schools assign summer projects to assure that their students are still learning during their breaks. However, as you grow up the tasks that are assigned tend to shift from something that is teacher-designed to student-designed. Some people may say that teacher-designed assignments are more beneficial to a students learning, because teachers know the material that should be learned and these project are easier to understand. However, they are wrong because student-designed projects have a lot more benefits that are necessary to a students learning and growth. Summer projects should be student-designed because they ensure that the subject of the assignment is relevant and interesting to the student and they teach them important skills.

To begin, student-designed projects let students pick subjects that are most likely to benefit them. Teachers dont know what field every student wants to study in, and so they cant make a project that will be beneficial to everyone. For example, the most common summer assignment is to read a book and then write an essay on what the student has learned, which helps kids in their reading and writing skills. However if a student wanted be a scientist, although this project would be somewhat useful, it wouldnt help them get closer to achieving their goals and dreams. On the other hand if the project would have been student-designed the future scientist could have chosen to conduct experiments or learn more about what interests them. Also, student-designed projects motivate kids to continue learning and so they wont lose interest. When a student picks their own assignment, they will be more likely to finish it and more than that they will actually want to finish the project. An example of this in a different context from my daily life is myself doing some cleaning. If my parents told me to clean, i will most likely put it off or do a sloppy job, because i didn't want to do it in the first place and at that point i am being pressured and forced to do the chore, but if i chose to do it on my own terms everything would get done in an orderly fashion. I feel like students use a similar mindset for completing project. If it was student-designed, they would be motivated to keep working and in the end they would produce better work. Some people may say that teacher-designed projects are better because, they focus on material that students should know for every career option, but they are wrong because what is important to learn in one field might not be as important to learn if they chose to pursue a job in another field.

Secondly, student-designed projects teach students very important life skills. It teaches them to be self-reliant. They have to come up with their own project and set out their own rules and criteria. They cant look back at the instructions and follow what the teacher said, and they cant ask specific question about how to do the project, because everyone has a different project specific to themselves. This type of project makes it necessary to think on their own and not get help or take short cuts from others. Learning how to problem solve and understand things on your own is something that will be crucial as an adult so it best to learn it at a young age. Also, self-projects help you stay organized. When you are doing something completely on your own, with your own ideas you cant lose or forget things because it is detrimental to your project. Unlike something that is assigned where you can just look back on the website or check the paper to find the answers, you have to keep track of everything yourself or else you wont have the answers. Lastly, student-designed projects help with time-management. During my personal project, since i had trips and activities planned during the summer, i had to set out a specific time line with goals that i wanted to have complete by each week. Before this project, I was very bad at completing tasks because i would always put it off until it was the very last minute. With this project, i was forced to do everything in a process or else i would fall behind. Students would not learn all these skills if everything was laid out by a teacher in a teacher-designed project.

Although teacher-designed projects are easier to understand and the teacher know what material is important, student-designed projects are a lot more beneficial to every individual student. Having a student design their own summer project ensures that what they are choosing to learn is beneficial and interesting to them. It also teaches students life skills that are important for everyone to learn at a young age. The point of summer assignments are to keep the student learning even when they are out of school. I think if the main goal of the school was to have students just learn information during the summer, then a teach-designed project would be acceptable. However, if the schools wanted their students to not only learn but grow and develop as young adults, then having student-designed projects are the better options to go with. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
619F7C42139E,"Why do you think teachers should be allowed to design summer projects?

Teachers should be allowed to design projects during the summer for students. My reasons for why teachers should be allowed are that teachers know what they want their assignment to be about. Another is that it can be hard for students to come up with something on their own. Finally Students might forget about and not do it at all.

Teachers who design their projects for students knows how they want the students to do their assignment.

Teachers that design their projects can be easier for students because they will know what to do and how to do it.

Teachers that design the project can me more professional becasue students may make a mistake and not know what they missed and can look to see and fix it.

Students who are busy during the summertime might be harder for them to come up with a projects on their own. They may have jobs that wre very stressful for them to even think about a project. Students can have summer school and might have work from other teachers to complete.

Students having to do assignments on thier own can be bad. Students might not even do thier assignment because it is summer break and wanna have fun with thier friends. Students who might forget about the assignment can be busy during the summer they can be traveling with famliy or even having a job.

Teachers should be allowed to design summer projects for students because its easier for students to get it done faster.",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
5F3F027AABDA,"During summer break, many teachers will assign a project that is designed to give students the freedom to work at their own pace and fully discover and interesting topic. When this project is designed too specifically by the teacher, however, many students become disinterested and only do the bare minimum of work. In order to keep students motivated, and make the project beneficial in their future lives, students should be allowed to design their own project for the summer. Student-designed summer projects motivate pupils to create higher quality products, solve diverse real-world problems, and develop unique skill sets that cannot be learned inside the classroom.

On the other hand, there are many who support the use of teacher-designed summer projects, because they are more related to the subjects taught in school and thus more useful in furthering students' education. Opponents cite several studies that show students forget nearly ten percent of what they learn in school over summer break. With a teacher-led project during the break, students will be encouraged to remember and use what they have learned in school instead of letting months of hard work in school go to waste. While it is true that students will learn more of the curriculum through a teacher-designed project, a better use of the time during summer is to teach subjects not covered in the curriculum. Topics that are specific to certain career fields can only be learned through independent study, and student-led summer projects are the most effective way to encourage this kind of study.

When students are given the freedom to choose a project that plays to their interests and learning style, instead of being forced to do a certain project by their teachers, the quality of the students' projects improves dramatically. One way that this freedom encourages a higher quality project is by increasing student engagement. Modern psychological studies have shown that students are less driven to succeed at a task if they feel they are being forced to accomplish it. Students allowed to choose their own summer project would not feel forced into a specific course of action, increasing their engagement in the assignment and thus the overall quality of their final project. Designing their own project also creates a higher-quality product by adapting it to their own learning styles. Psychologists working in the field of memory have found that students often learn best in one of four learning styles: Reading/Writing, Auditory, Visual, or Kinesthetic. With the ability to adapt the requirements of the assignment to their learning styles, students would create a higher-quality product with much less unnecessary effort. Because of this increase in quality, student-designed projects are also very effective at solving real-world problems.

Projects that have been chosen and designed by students create solutions to real-world problems in ways that teacher-led ones cannot. By deciding on their own projects, students can pursue interests that lie outside of the usual subjects found in school. Summer projects designed by teachers usually focus on one of the few categories of science, english, or mathematics that schools teach. Students who are provided the opportunity to design a project on their own will be able to pursue fields of study that are not touched on by schools, gaining knowledge in many other diverse areas of study. In addition, the ability to choose their own projects allow students to tackle problems that face our world today with their own unique solutions. As one example of this, a team of students who chose their own project for science class was able to create groundbreaking new technology for removing floating debris from the ocean, which has the potential to improve the lives of billions of people who depend on the health of the ocean to survive. If more students could pursue their interests in the same way that this team did, many new solutions to today's problems would emerge. In addition, students who pursue their own interests in this way are also much more prepared for their chosen careers in the future.

Student-designed projects develop unique skills in students that are not learned through teacher-led study. One skill that independent projects teach is the ability to do creative, independent work. As adults, many find that leadership positions in the workplace require some degree of creativity, and tasks must often be completed with little input from those higher in the chain of authority. By allowing students to produce their own ideas and work on their own schedule, rather than assigning students ideas and schedules, student-led projects encourage the traits that are necessary for any productive member of society. In giving students the independence to try out their own ideas, these projects also allow students to learn skills that are not covered by the main subjects of traditional schooling. For example, a student interested in becoming a veterinarian would not learn very much about his or her desired career through the core classes, but would learn a great deal through a project requiring him or her to study animals. Student-designed projects, therefore, are much more effective than teacher-designed ones when it comes to preparing students for their future professions, and for their future lives as a whole.

When students are presented the opportunity to design their own summer projects, they become motivated to improve the quality of their work, make a lasting impact on the real world, and develop unique skills that can aid them in future careers. When students are given the freedom to choose who they want to be early on in their lives, they become better equipped in the future to make their dreams a reality. In order to produce students who are skilled, effective, and motivated to succeed, teachers should allow their students to choose what subjects they would like to explore during the summer.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
ABD3B53BC183,"When someone says the word summer, people don't generally think about classrooms, or tardy bells, or chalkboards. Rather, about freedom from all of those things. Summer is a much needed break from the stressful conditions of school, however, whenever summer is ending and it's time to start heading back to school, students sometimes find themselves forgetting most of what they learned the year before. Some schools are requiring students to complete projects over the summer to ensure that they keep learning outside of the classroom, and to keep what they have learned the year before, fresh in their minds. These projects should be student-designed because summer should not be a continuation of school, students are more likely to do a project if they get to choose what it is, and it gives students the opportunity to excel and be given more trust.

Summer is the time of year where students generally feel stress-free. There's no due dates, and no pressing homework. If these mandatory projects were teacher-designed, summer would feel more like school, and then students would have a bad connotation with the word summer. Sometimes people brush under the rug how stressful school can actually be to students, and summer is a much needed break. Though students do need to continue learning, it would be hard for a teacher to assign a project that fit everyone's specific needs and was appropriate for all students outside of the classroom. Summer break was installed for a reason, because if students go to school for 12 months, they'll more than likely get burnt out and will lose the motivation to learn. If students are allowed to design their own projects, they won't see it as school, but as fun.

Students-no matter what age; kids, pre-teens, teenagers- haven't fully developed yet. They don't know who they are, or what they want, or what they believe in, because all they've known is their parents and the little bubble they live in for the first 18 years of their life. They try to find themselves everyday, they try to discover what their identity is. If students were able to design their own over the summer projects, they would be more likely to do it. There comes a point during childhood when people start to question authority, and start to become rebellious because they think they know what's best for themselves. At some point, kids have to be given that freedom in order for them to fail, gain humility, and then try again. If teachers were the ones designing the projects, students would be less likely to do it, and their grades would suffer.

Teachers will generally tell you that trust is everything. If you don't have trust then you have nothing. Getting to pick your own project as a student, I would be elated. It shows that your teacher trusts that you will make the right decision and that you will get it done. The projects should differ from child to child because if one child wants to excel, then the limitations on the project to make another student comfortable, should not restrict him. Student-designed projects gives the students opportunity to excel in learning and to gain more trust from their teachers. Students usually have breakthroughs at least once during the years they are in school, when they start to realize that what they're learning is important and they start to care about what it is that they're learning, and learning becomes less like a burden and more like a privilege. Designing their own projects could spurr on this breakthrough and help students to realize that school isn't as bad as once anticipated.

Summer should be a break from all the things that cause stress in the everyday lives of students. It should be a time to unwide and relax. Schools are beginning to issue over-the summer projects to make sure that the students keep learning, and remember what they have previously learned. These projects should be student-designed because summer should not be a continuation of school, students are more likely to do a project if they get to choose what it is, and it gives students the opportunity to excel and be given more trust. This will ensure that students stay happy over the summer, while teachers are equally as happy knowing that all of their hard work to educate the students has not gone to waste.                    ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
B1C0DDEE474D,"Some schools require students to do projects during the summer, and whether the projects should be teacher-designed or students-designed. In my opinion,the summer projects should be teacher-designed because it can be helpful for future related times and giving guidelines can make the projects much easier. Summer projects should be teacher-designed due to it be able to benefit them the upcoming school year.

To start with, teachers can give students guidelines for the project. The more instructions the students are able to have then the more understandable the project can be. Getting guidelines can give the students more ideas and can be less frustrating doing the project can be. For example,Generic_Name,a student at Generic_School,is spending time starting her project,she is confused on what to do from the beginning until she opened the guidelines that she was giving, having the guidelines made it much more easier to finish due to having a list on what was needed for the project.

Secondly,having to do projects under teacher circumstances can be beneficial for related times in the future. Many more projects could come and be far more complicated,but using their current knowledge from past experience can make the project less frustrating. For example,Generic_Name has to start an project,now that the students are back in school from break,in the past he would struggle with projects,but by using his past knowledge that he learned,he had finished and reached all the expectations needed. In conclusion,using knowledge that you learned from the same situation in the past on your current ones can very much help in the future.

Some people may disagree due to others seeing it in different ways. Others may see the project as not interesting because the students should be able to do it the way they want to due to them having to do the object during the summer and it not being able to benefit them because the students can not look back on their mistakes. Although, the project not being interesting should not be the case because they are learning not playing around. In addition, the students should know that having ideas on an project can help more so confusing them.

In conclusion,these are my reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed. The project being teacher-designed,allows more ideas that the students are able to use and makes the project easier. The students should now be able to use the guidelines to be able to benefit them on future projects on their upcoming year.          ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
1BC3B3906262,"Think back to a time during the summer, you finally get a break from school, you can relax and do whatever you usually do in your leisure time, but you remember that you have an uninteresting, unwanted, summer project assigned by your teacher that is due in the new school year. Any student can say that they've had a summer project that they rather just not do, yet they have to face the fact that at some point they will have to get over not wanting to do it and push themselves to get it done anyway. Some people may say that summer projects designed by teachers are more affective on the students due to the teacher displaying their style of lesson plans and how they like to teach their students new material depending on the specific lesson. However, I think they are wrong because if students are able to design their own summer projects, they will be more engaged with the topic it's centered around, they will be able to compromise on a learning style for the project that suits them the most, and the amount of students who turn their projects in on time, fully completed, will increase drastically.

Student-designed summer projects will ensure that students will be more engaged with the project and what they are learning. It is known that if you allow students to give their input on how they would like a certain, assignment, project, or lesson to be created for them, they will end up being more engaged with whatever the specific form of learning may be. The ideas from the students will circle around and bounce off the walls until the most attractive ideas for the assignment, lesson, or in this case project, have been surfaced. Students also enjoy swapping the roles of teacher and student because it allows the student to ensure they will recieve a good grade, enjoy doing the project, and comprehend what they are learning in the best way. Some people may say that students should be able to adapt to whatever way teacher presents a topic of learning and a project to you. However, they are wrong because the way a teacher designs a project can be challenging and take the student a decent amount of time to comprehend how a teacher specifically wants a project done. In conclusion, allowing a student to design their own summer project will raise the chances of a student being fully engaged with the topic of learning and the project.

Student-designed summer projects also come with the benefit of being able to compromise on a specific learning style for the project that will best suit all of the students that have to do it. An example would be that some students learn best visually, they like to have things taught to them shown through diagrams and pictures, so that they can invisualize the topic at hand. The learning style that fits the student the best will display how well they do on the project because of them being able to comprehend it better. I have experienced seeing students ask teachers to explain the topic that they are learning in a different way from what the teacher explained it to them, so that the information could mentally mesh within their brain. Sometimes it takes a certain approach for a student to understand what they are learning and it takes a learning style that best suits them to do that. Some people may say that students don't always have a choice in the learning style a teacher chooses to teach them in. However, they are wrong because students will express to teachers that the information given to them needs to be in a form that best mimics their personal learning style. In conclusion, a student-designed summer project benefits the student by being able to learn the way that suits them best while being away from school, at home, using their specific learning style.

Student designed summer projects will increase the amount of projects completed and turned in on time drastically. A summer project given to a student that does not interest them will cause a student to procrastinate, miss the deadline and have to turn it in late, or just not turn it in at all due to the fact that it is summer and most students aren't very concerned with school work. The project must sincerely gain the excitement of the students so that the project will get completed and turned in on time. If students are able to design the specifics of the project the completion and turning in of the project would decrease overall. For example, from my experience of having summer projects I myself, and other students that I know, have waited until the last minute to do a summer project because of the way the teacher designed it for us. Students are the best people to design projects for what they may be learning because they know what they like and the best ways to instill what they are learning in their brains. Some people may say that students completing their summer projects and turning them in on time depends on the students' skill of time-management. However, they are wrong because time-management wouldn't play a factor in a student-designed project due to the project being designed by themselves, which would ultimately encourage them to do it. In conclusion a student-designed summer project would increase the amount of comepleted and turned in projects allowing the students to have their input in it.

I believe that if students are able to design their own summer projects the students will be more enganged in the project, compromise on a learning style that suits them the best for the project, and increase the amount of projects completed and turned in on time. Students will have a better understanding of what needs to be done for the project and set a specific criteria. Students will be able to not only get done, but enjoy their project will completing it over the summer. The project will not be catered to one style of learning, to the vast majority of students. Also, students designing their summer projects will motivate them to finish the project on time due their incorporation of ideas.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
C75471F5ED96,"Summer projects allow students to have the opportunity to learn while they are not in school and it can benefit them in many ways. Summer projects should be designed by students because it gives students the opportunity to learn more about something of their choice, it shows that they have a connection with the project, and it makes them more eager to learn about different things.

Students should be given the opportunity to create a project about something of their choice. It gives them independence and the ability to rely on themselves. It is good to give students independence starting at a young age because it allows them to be self reliant. Giving students the opportunity to create a project based on their own ideas and their own planning, will allow for success later in life.

Another reason why students should be able to design their own summer projects is because it will show the teacher how much of a connection they have to the topic. Teachers love when a student creates a well designed and well thought out project. If a student were to be given a project designed by the teacher, the student would feel like they couldn't do much with it because they have no connection with it. When students have a connection with something it makes them feel more enthusiastic about the project or assignment given to them.

Students are more eager to learn about new things after they researched something of their choice. When students have a choice, they would rather research something that they don't know too much about. After that topic is researched they feel enlightened. Students also tend to branch off of the topic that they first researched as well. This technique is often used by students because it makes research easier for them and they like to make things easier for them rather than harder.

In conclusion, Students should be able to design their own summer projects because it gives them new opportunities, it shows that they can connect to something, and it makes them more eager to learn about different things. Although teachers can provide students with a base and a template for their project, it would be best and beneficial for students to be able to create and think of something on their own. Students are more prepared for college and high up positions in life when they are given the opportunity to create something of their own. It allows students to have independence and other useful tools for their future.              ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
C42060BAF235,"Hello, reader! My name is Generic_Name. Some schools require student to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. many question if they should be teacher-designed or student-designed? I believe that students should be the ones planning their own summer projects because it will be their summer vacation that they'll have in order to work on it. If the teachers are the ones designing the projects for their students, then teachers will most likely get the same thing from every student. Not only that, we as students may not enjoy doing it as much, because when it comes to doing big projects like these, we desire to put in our own creativity. For these next two paragraphs, I will be talking about these two reasons in greater detail before ending this prompt with my conclusion. They will be backed up mostly by my personal experience, but I will put in my own opinions and reasons. I will also be putting in lots of unique words that will this prompt more interesting. Now, let's begin.

I don't believe teachers should be the ones planning out the project not for the fact that what they would assign will be boring or bad, but because each student might end up doing the same thing for each individual prompt, even if each student does put theyre own unique sense of creativity into them. For example, last year when I was doing Driver's Ed, we entered the part of Health & First Aid. And when all was said and done, we were given a project to do. It had to be be done on a tri-fold and the information had to be a printed out PowerPoint. I'll be honest, I really wasn't a happy chum doing the project at first, although I did enjoy doing the PowerPoint part of the project mostly because I have a love for PowerPoints. When the day came for the projects to turned in and graded, we all showed our own tri-folds to the class. Here, I noticed that we all did similar things in each of our tri-folds. True, we were each given a different topic to work on and many us got a little creative, but in the end we were pretty much the same.

I understand that they do that to make certain we don't procrastinate or do minimum, but in order the project to have some form of uniqueness & full creativity, the student should have complete charge over the what & how of the project. an example of this happened last year in my Spanish II class, where we did a project that was about choosing three Latino recipes and write them out in Spanish. Our teacher, Sr. Generic_Name allowed us to make our project however we wanted, from being a cookbook, miniature tri-fold, PowerPoint, etc. But he also wanted to see our full potential, not just in art but in language as well, so using an online translator was generally unacceptable. And although he was fine with three simple but complete sheets of paper, there wouldn't be any bonus points for that. Fortunately, I paid attention in his class and my mother a Puerto Rican cookbook which she lend to me to use. Also, I don't mean to brag but I'm a great artist who it self-taught.

Overall, I believe that students should their own thing in the project while at the same time, the teachers should receive something of great quality. The two examples I just talked about are my personal experiences & reasons why I believe in the power of the student, although I greatly understand the teacher's viewpoint giving us the basic backbone. So, in a way, neither side is perfect or wrong. But of course, thats just my opinion.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
D7FFBE6E0434,"Have you ever got a summer project? Summer projects are boring to do when all you want to do is have fun. Although, teachers can make the projects subject based and more specific. Students should design the summer projects because some students don't have access to internet, the projects will be unique, and the projects will have more effort and participation.

Firstly, some students don't have access to the internet. Most projects involve research. If the students can't do the research how are they going to do the project? Some teachers expect the project to be done but what if it can't be. Teachers need to realize not everyone has internet at home. For example, a student was given a project on King Henry's life. He doesn't have internet at home and the library is too far to walk. The student never did his project and got a really bad grade.

Secondly, the projects will be unique. The ideas that students can come up with are amazing. Kids have an unlimited amount of imagination and creativity, so letting them express that through a graded project can be really fun. For example, if the students were doing a science project. They have so many possibilities on what they can do. They could put Mentos in a diet Coke and write down what happens. If it was a photography project, the students can express themselves through the pictures and edit them however you want. There's so many more ideas tat students can come up with if you let them.

Thirdly, The projects will have more effort and participation. If the students have their own say, or choice, in what they get to do the project on, there would be more projects turned in. Plus, the effort put into the projects would be greater. For example, one class gets to choose their project and another class do not get to choose. The class that got to pick their project has more projects, and more effort put into the projects, then the class that didn't get to choose. Another example is the teachers choose what students do one year for summer projects. Many students do not put in a lot of effort, just enough to get a good grade, and some don't even bother turning it in. The next year, the teachers let the students pick what to do for their projects. Most of the students turn in the projects and a lot of effort was put into them.

In conclusion, students should design the projects instead of the teachers. Some students do not have internet. The projects will be unique. Also, the effort put it and the participation of the projects will be greater. If you have a summer project, convince your teacher to let the class design it. You'll see so many cool projects you might have not thought of.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
1AE24A0A5097,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. When teacher give projects, the student is limited to what they can do.

When student are given projects and is able to do their own topic, they don't stay on the topic they choose.

I think summer projects should be teacher-designed. This would be better because the students have a topic, its easy, and is fast to do.

First, the students has topic. When a student has a one topic, they cant go talk about another topic. The student doesn't have to struggle between three or more subjects because they have one given to them. The teacher gives a specific topic because it's supposed to challenging. They want the students to use their brains.

Second, the topic is easy. Some school teachers give their students easy topics because they wants students to enjoy their summer break. The subject should be easy for two reason for example: they had the topic before or its very simple.

Third, the subject is fast to do. The topic should be fast to do because the teacher was able to do it. Their previous students was able to do it with no problem. The student should get the project done because it helps them retain the information the learned.

Students-designed projects are interesting to give over the summer break. They are interesting for many reasons. The first reason is because the students has free to work on any topic they want. Second, it's going to make the teacher curious to see what the student did as a project. Third, student would get it done quicker because they want to have enough time for the summer.

Fourth, it would be challenging because the student has more than one topic to choose from. The final reason is to let the students use their imagination.

A4BD4E0A3B01,"In a 2019 survey about homework during the summer, it was found that the majority of students said that they were extremely stressed about summer assignments that teacher's had required them to do. Many of the students expressed that they had busy schedules and could not find the time to complete the assignments. Other's said that the projects were too difficult and confusing because they were designed poorly. While some will say that these summer assignments should continue to be designed by teachers because they are more educational, to be beneficial, the assignments should be student-designed to prevent boredom, frustration, and time consumption.

Firstly, summer assignments should be student-designed to prevent boredom. For instance, the majority of the assignments are question or essay based. This means that instead of enjoying a learning activity that applies to them, students will have to answer dull repetitive questions and write uninteresting essays about topics that they have no passion for. In result, students will put minimum effort into the assignments and finish them without learning anything. Also, if the summer assignments were designed by the students, they would pick a topic that they have interest in or believe would be enjoyable to complete. For example, if a project was assigned that allowed students to present an issue that they found interesting, the student would more than likely be excited and motivated to write about their topic. Overall, projects assigned during the summer should be designed by the students in order to prevent boredom.

Secondly, students should design their summer assignments to prevent frustration. This is because during the summer, teachers will assign packets or papers that are confusing and difficult to complete, thinking that it will be beneficial or educational. However, this is not the case. Many students will find themselves stuck or frustrated trying to complete something that they have no idea how to do. This results in uncompleted or incorrect work that then starts the student's school year off poorly. Furthermore, if the assignments were designed by the students, they would have the ability to preview and understand what the project is asking. In other words, they would have the correct knowledge going into the assignment and will ultimately learn more about the material for the following school year. In the end, a project designed by a student will prevent frustration.

Lastly, summer projects designed by the students will take up less time. This is because many students are extremely busy during the summer. Between sports, vacations, and possible online classes, students find it difficult to manage summer homework. Teachers are not aware of every student's schedule and can assign projects that are almost impossible to complete. However, if the projects were designed by the students, this would not occur. Instead, students would design a project that they could easily time manage and complete in their own time. Also, because teacher-designed projects are long and complicated, this can cause a student to miss out on fun activities. This is because of the created stress and limited time that the students often experience from the projects assigned. For example, during the summer, many students are traveling and are rarely in town at the same time. However, when they are, a student with an unfinished project, could miss out on an opportunity to see their friend because they are too busy with homework. All in all, summer projects should be student-designed because this would prevent time consumption.

Overall, students should design the summer projects. This is because it will prevent boredom, frustration, and time consumption. If students experience these effects, the projects assigned will not only ultimately be ineffective but it will cause unnecessary stress. The purpose of summer is to enjoy a break from school anxiety. If projects do not reflect this, then a student's summer could possibly be ruined. In the end, in order prevent this, talk to your teacher and see if your summer could be saved with an enjoyable, simple, and quick project instead. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
62A5873FD2BC,"Throughout a students educational experience, they have the 3 month break at the end of each year that allows them to have time off and have a break from the intense rigor of school. Although, the break can better be purposed by having assignments to further their knowledge during this time period. These projects can best be designed as student led so that students can have more creativity and imagination towards the project, specialize one topic based on future educational interest, and ensures that students have the resources they need to complete the assignment.

From Kindergarten through grade 12, each student is given a curriculum to follow and learn for a standardized test at the end of the year; student led summer projects would allow for a broader outlook on their schooling education and explore topics that would not be looked at otherwise. A student who only learns about their immediate community and ecosystem can gain a broader perspective on society after completing a summer project about an ecosystem in another region of the world. The additional thought and imagination put into a project like this would be hard to complete in an organized project created by a teacher. Furthermore, students commonly bored during one project that a large group of students have to complete. The rules and rubric which have to be followed deprive the students of exploration and investigation which is crucial for a successful education. Allowing for students to find their choice of exploration and then present it in a unique way brings a complex ideology about interesting topics. Not only is the content of student led projects productive, but so is the way of deriving that information. Commonly, classrooms follow a strict set of rules to ensure each students safety, but those rules come with a cost. The rules cause students to think in one way, act in one way, and test in one specific way. A summer project which gives students space to compete based on their creativity allows them to break out of those boundaries and complete what they want to complete.

A students future college path can also be benefited by student based summer projects due to the option of focusing on their desired topic. As students age into their final years of high school, many already know the path they want to take in college and ultimately their occupations. Giving students an option to focus and research on these topics will not only allow them to understand more about the topic but also build their application to give them a better chance at getting into respected schools. A student who wants to explore the medical pathway might use the summer project as a chance to see what the field is about. That student might shadow surgeons or pediatricians and then analyze and report their findings. The alternate option of teacher led student projects would not allow for this type of unique opportunity. Using the report of their findings, a student can better apply for prestigious college opportunities, scholarships and programs through their past experience that gives them a step up from their competing applicants.

Lastly, the guidelines given to the entirety of the public schooling system leaves students in lower socioeconomic situations to not be able to complete certain projects. The student led project system allows students to find a topic that is accessible for them rather than one that has a large demand for expensive purchases. Certain projects specifically in the science department, require an excessive amount of resources making them hard to obtain out of the school setting. If the teacher led projects would require students to purchase these goods, difficulties would arise in regards to the ability for all students to have access and an abundance of these items. Although supplies may be given through the schooling system, a work space might be difficult to obtain as well. Choosing a project that not only gains the students interest but also allows them to complete it with ease displays the benefits of student led projects.

Projects that can be completed during the summer should be led by the students desires and aspirations as it will gain allow for the most success of the student. Student led projects show most effective through the ability for students to use their imagination, research a topic they might study in college, and complete the work productively and efficiently.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
6F83F249780F,"One of the most truly modern American experiences has got to be voicing one's opinion on a subject they have little to know knowlege or experience with to the world. Unfortunately, today my opinion will not be voiced to the world as this is a SOL test, but it will be a scarecly informed opinion for sure. I have the privilige of never being assigned a project by a school over the summer, but today's prompt has drawn something to my attention that I never quite thought about before- That these summer projects assigned by schools should absolutely be designed by the students who have to do them as they can then be tailored to fit the students interests and schedules, within reason of course.

Starting off positive, the most obvious pro of student designed summer projects is the creative liberty. Students would not only be free to pick whatever topic or subject they like, but the form their project takes. A student could go the conventional route and do a presentation with a trifold or something similar, or go in the opposite direction and hold a workshop explaining why purple light doesn't technically exist, complete with interactive features. They may even incorporate their other summer activities into their project, as a student traveling to France for the summer might research a part of French history and include their own photos that they took that relate to the topic. Speaking of other summer activities, students with jobs, internships, or anything else that may take up multiple hours of the day could then ensure that the project they give themself is something that they can handle.

Now that I've explained all the wonderful pros of student designed projects, lets reign it back in a bit and disscuss the cons and some solutions to those cons along with my mildly valid expertise. I've been a girl scout since I was in elementary school and for the past few summers been doing research for a gold award project, the highest honor that a girl scout can earn. The main focus of a gold award is of course the project, which is designed entirely by the scout, may take anywhere from a couple of months to a year, and a proposal of said project has to be approved by a council.

Granted, this is on a bit of a larger scale compared to a school summer project, but there are some good ideas that could be drawn from this. Approval of the project idea could ensure that the projects have genuine learning value, and could be approved by the student's counselor. Conselors would then also see to that students give themselves proper workloads, ensuring that they don't overwork themselves, or take the easy route either. Putting a deadline on the approval might also help encourage students to at least think about their project a bit before the night it's due. Gold awards also look good on college applications, and allowing students to make their projects something that they would be so proud of to put on a college application could be a boost in motivation for those college-bound.

The concept of allowing students to have this much control over a project as we move towards an education system where the students are being allowed more control and freedom day by day can be truly great when done correctly. Which can absolutely happen, when necessary restraints are given. It simply requires more work on everyone's part, and considering that educational instititions are supposed to be preparing entire generations for life itself, and not just a workplace or university, that shouldn't be too hard? Perhaps I put too much faith in this but I truly do hope to see the day when students are proactive enough to go about these sorts of things on their own, not for a grade or award, but to better themselves and the world around them.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
B6EFDEA59653,"During the school year, a student completes set projects and curriculum in order to pass the classes which they are enrolled in. Over the summer, however, some schools require that projects should be assigned to students so that they continue to learn. I think that these projects should be student-designed because they will allow students to explore new fields, inspire creativity, and take away stress from students.

Student designed projects will allows students to explore new fields that they may be interested in. If students are able to design their own summer projects, then they are able to choose a topic that is interesting to them for this project. This will allow the student to explore, research, and experiment within new fields. This exploration and research of new fields is very beneficial because it helps students find a career path based on what topics they are interested in.

Having student-designed summer projects will inspire creativity. If a student is able to create their own project without need of a rubric or teacher to guide them, then this project is truly coming from the student. This will allow students to really show themselves when completing these projects. If students are just given a teacher-designed project, they are just following a rubric and completing what the teacher wants them to do. This work can be numb and boring for the students who could be using all their creativity on their own self-designed project.

Student-designed projects will take away a lot of the stress that some students have during normal teacher-designed projects. Students will be less focused on doing everything right since the project is designed by them. These students will instead be able to focus on learning the material instead of stressing over getting a good grade. This will improve both the students mental health and the value in learning the student is actually receiving from a project.

Schools should allow these summer projects to be student-designed. Although some may argue that teacher-designed projects are better because it guarantees that a student will learn a specific curriculum, student-designed summer projects have so many more benefits. I believe that these projects should be student-designed because they will allow students to explore new fields, inspire creativity, and take away stress from students",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
246A11006D33,"The summer project is something that often looms over the minds' of students. We often find students bellyaching about how they are missing out on fun summer activities. More often than not, it is the teachers who assign the projects, and even though teachers are more educated on certain subjects, it would be appropriate to believe that students should design summer projects. This sort of activity over the summer would promote individuality, entrepreneurship, and personal responsibility.

Some people think that individuality is not necessary in an industrial world, but really, it is the backbone of this nation and student designed projects promote such individuality. In the long term, individuality leads to higher paying jobs in the future. It is well known that if more people have high paying jobs, there will be less homelessness and a stimulated economy. As well, creativity stems from a sense of individuality. Fine arts are the future of the world as we are getting closer to not needing hard labor. The arts also jump start economic progress by putting more money into the system. All this individuality leads to entrepreneurship.

There is an argument to be made that not all students will be entrepreneurs, but it is important to nurture entrepreneurial practices, which can be done through aforementioned student designed projects. Entrepreneurs tend to be better off in the real world. This may sound repetitive, but we really need more people with big ideas so that the world can progress. The loss of this kind of person means the loss of all those years spent building the world from the ground up. As well, the process of designing a project could lead to students designing a business in the future. The process for creating such projects is quite involved, and it leads to more focused adults in the future. In reality though, none of this would be possible without a sense of personal responsibility.

Many people in this modern world believe that the only way to become more responsible is to get a job, and while this is partially accurate, projects such as this will always nurture responsibility. For example, completion of projects lead to the student feeling more accomplished. That sense of accomplishment make students feel like accomplishing more will make them feel even better, leading to them being more responsible with projects in their future. As well, project planning in youth will lead to the individual taking charge within projects in their future. It is important to have students be proactive in their career as it will likely lead to better positions and better pay.

To finish, responsibility will only develop if you let your student take charge, be it in a career or in a project. While some people may disagree, this is the truth, hard work cannot do all the heavy lifting. As a country we need to develop our youths' sense of entrepreneurship,individuality, and personal responsibility or else we will not progress as a people.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
F1982187FCC1,"Students-designed projects should always be assigned even during the school year. Students-design are more understandable that teacher-design. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Projects should be student-design so they can relate more, showcase your creativity and skills, and be more exciting for the students.

Even though, teacher-design projects will be able to test our knowledge. They are not made for children the way a student- design would be. Student- design projects will relate to students more because it will be base around us. We will have total control, unlike how sum teacher-design projects have rules and guidelines that stop us from being fully open. For, example i had to do a essay about my summer adventures. I chose to write about the time i visited my grandparents in Florida. A few days went by and my teacher wanted to talk to me. She wanted me to rethink my essay because she did not feel any excitement reading it. I didn't agree with her because i always had fun with my grandparents. We would feed the sea turtles, go on night walks at the beach, and go to the board walk's carnival. She still felt as if i wasn't meet the project requirements. This project played a important role in my grade, so i accepted it and rewrote my essay.

In addition student-based projects will show how creative we are. This will give students the opportunity to show off their talent and ideas. Teacher- designed projects do not always allow students to show what they are fully capable of, it only shows what they want to see. Such as, my friend Generic_Name had to do a portrait for her finals in art. She sketched an amazing portrait with a lot of details, so she could show her skills off. This was very risky, to much detail could throw the sketch off. Her adviser thought that she should do something simple to ensure she will get an easy A. Generic_Name wanted more that a easy grade, she wanted her artwork to inspire people and to make a mark, so she went with her idea instead. Now her paint is hanging in the museum of art and is displayed every month downtown.

Next, Student-designed projects will be way more fun and entertaining for students. Every year we receive projects that are boring and does not interest us. Teacher-designed project have no personality and are way to formal. Students-designed projects can be more funny, silly and excited, it can bring happiness back to school projects. For example, two teachers, Generic_Name and Generic_Name assigned the same project. Generic_Name gave her students a teacher-designed project, but Generic_Name didnt. She let her students chose their own project and gave them a rubric of what she would be looking for. Generic_Name class's project still related to science but was personalized. It showed that they really tried and had fun doing this project. She had never seen so many smiles on students faces as they presented their projects. It showed her that she made the right chose.

In conclusion, these are all the reason why we should get student-designed projects. It is showed that student- designed projects can help and motivate students. Projects should be student-design so they can relate more, showcase your creativity and skills, and be more exciting for the students. In the end this will be the best for students.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
669A595FD66F,"Researchers say, if people take a few month break from something, they will most likely forget it and will have to relearn it. Some schools require students to complete projects over the summer. People debate on whether the project should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because it would allow the student to be more creative, do a project they would enjoy, and gives students more independence.

If students were to be required to make a summer project and it was student-designed, it would let students be more creative. Most teachers and parents want their student/child to think outside the box. A student led project would make students use their brain more, during their 2 month long break of not doing anything. The project would allow students to develop an independent mind. They would give a nudge for students to get out of their comfort zone. The project would make students think more independently at a younger age. As they get older, they will be more inclined to do things out of their comfort zone. Supporting a student to lead his summer project would make the next generation more creative.

A student led summer project would allow students to pick a topic they would enjoy. Majority of people will produce quality work if they have a passion for it. People like to work on projects they enjoy and can open their minds to. If someone likes a subject they will most likely want to pursue that subject. Some students will find the topics a teacher gives them boring and unmotivating. This is due to the fact that one person cannot satisfy everyone in the room. If a student doesn't like a topic they will not enjoy it and it will not accurately represent their academic skills. Allowing students to lead their own summer projects, means they will pick something they will enjoy and have a passion for.

Doing a student led summer project would give students more independence. Students would have to take more responsibility. If a student were to do bad on a project they would have to take responsibility for their actions. It would train the next generation to take responsibility instead of blaming someone else. This would give students more preparation for the adult life. They school system gives little to no preparation on how to manage an adult life, but it would give students a little more experience for the students. A project like this would give people a little nudge to grow up gradually. Summer projects would give more independence, if it was student led.

Student led summer projects would, overall, allow students to be more creative, do something they enjoy, and give students more independence. The projects would mold students to take responsibility, think outside the box, and pursue something they enjoy and have a passion for. Summer projects should be student-designed so they can continue learning over the summer break.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
3BC78976B522,"Some schools will assign students projects over summer break to assure they will continue to learn school subjects. Summer is a long time and will give the students enough time to learn what is needed. There is a small debate as to whether the students or the teachers should design these projects. Although many teachers will assign and create these projects because they can make sure the students will learn what they need to learn, students should design these projects because many teachers will give to big of a project, many students might not have enough time to work on said project, and giving the student the ability to create the project will assure it can get done.

The first reason to support this claim is that teachers may give to big of a project. Normally, teacher will give a student a project to work on and learn but there is no telling how big that project could be. The teacher could say to create 1 deck of study cards or to write a 10 page essay on something that student may not have learned about. And many times the student may not get the project done in a way the teacher likes because they did not get a chance to go over something like that. Lastly, sometimes the student can get anxious or nervous about having to create a project as big or small as the teacher assigns.

Secondly, a student may not have the time to work on a big project. Teachers look forward to the summer just as much as kids do. Summer is a time to hang out with family or earn some money at a job. Many students simply will not have enough time to worry about creating a big school project. Everyone has responsibilities, like work, family, or just household tasks, and lots of people can not make enough time to work on summer projects. Also depending on how big the assigned project will be and how many teachers assign projects can be to much and give a student not enough time to complete them all.

Lastly, if a students designs a project they can make it so that it can revolve around their schedule. A teacher will normally give students a big project and expect it to be done without thinking about how a student has a life outside of school just like a teacher. For the majority of students, they are too busy with summer responsibilities to be able to work on a teacher assigned school project. If a student is given the right to create their own project, following some small steps from the teacher, there is a higher chance that the student will get the project done rather than not complete it.

In conclusion, students should be able to assign and create their own projects. Many reasons include how big the project is, how much time it will take, and how much time the student can work on it. So to make it easier on everyone, students should be able to make their own projects that can revolve around their own lives and responsibilities. ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
83F4F29E9662,"Are students responsible enough to design their own school projects? Numerous schools require students to complete projects over the summer to ensure learning, but this method may be ineffective. If students were given the freedom to design their own projects it would lead to greater performance due to the likelihood that students will pick topics that interest them, that projects would be generalized to help students in the fields with which they require assistance, and the possibility of students forgetting about the project would be lower if they actively worked on it.

However, some may disagree with this viewpoint. Some may say that designing their own projects provides students with an opportunity to pick an easy topic with which they will not be challenged. Nevertheless there are other viewpoints to consider.

Firstly, students, when given the opportunity, will always choose to work on a topic that interests them. Studies show that working with a topic that interest them improves the performance of students while also increasing the possibility of them making an effort to complete their work. However, this is not the only reason why students should design their own summer projects.

Additionally, while some may argue that students would choose to work on topics which they find easy, the chance of a class of students all thriving in the same subjects is highly improbable. Due to the fact that some students will choose to work in subjects which they don't find challenging, students may end up choosing topics which challenge their peers and inadvertently create a project which is all encompassing. But these are not the only reasons students should design their own summer projects.

Finally when any person puts considerable effort into something it causes information related to the subject becomes learned more easily. This is one of the reasons why teachers use methods such as taking notes to reinforce what students are learning. So, logically a group of students working together to choose a topic and subject which they are all satisfied with will reinforce the knowledge of such a project and therefore decrease the likelihood that students will forget about their summer projects thereby improving results.

However, there are many more reasons that students should design their own summer projects.

In conclusion, students should have a hand in creating their own summer projects to choose topics which interest them, as well as to increase the likelihood of them completing said projects, and finally create a project in which all students may both thrive and struggle.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
9510F68977D7,"Summer projects should be student-designed. No student likes to do projects in the summer, Students will require motivation and excitement. If students can design their own project, they can be different and more creative. Students enjoy tasks where there's no limit as to what they can do; it gives them the opportunity to try something new. This gives teachers less work and students a more thoughtful tasks. Overall, this will give students a reason to learn, even during they're break.

This is a good way to assure students are still learning. It also gives the students more of a challenge and prepare them for the following school year. Students can use this as a way to see how they're doing and also to stay involved in school. If it were a teacher-designed project, most students wouldnt participate. Since the students are the ones designing it, it'll give them a little more excitement and control over the project.

Students tend to work harder and be more creative when it is a self-designed project. This will open more opportunities and more ideas. Designing your own project gives students the freedom and control that they love. For example, the few times I've been able to design my own project I always put forth more effort and creativity; This is because students love to try different things and be in control. This is important because it teaches students valuable skills that they may need in the real world.

If students are interested and have ideas, summer projects can be really beneficial. Allowing students to create their own project is a great way to interest them. Students tend to work best when they have their own ideas, it's a lot easier and gives the student more freedom. This can teach students to be more independent and hardworking.

A project can show effort and knowledge, when students create their own it shows their best work. It allows students to show what they are capable of. That is why I believe students should design their own project.      ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
2E3043C283B5,"Throughout the school year, both staff and students await summers warm arrival. As the incoming heat and sunscreen draws the final semester to an end, the dreaded thoughts of summer projects spread. Whether it be summer-readings or instructional packets, several high schools urge, if not require, teachers to assign summer projects to assure continuous learning over the two month break. Recently, however, students have debated that these projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed. Designing their own projects would allow students to pursue topics they interest, the creative freedom that makes their projects unique, and ensure each students ability to complete projects with the resources available to them.

Often times students are required to complete a project they lack interest in. A 2013 study confirms that when students are given the opportunity to design individual assignments, they are 78% more inclined to participate and are confident of their final product. If a particular student is interested in basketball, they would be more willing to read a book and write an accompanying paper about its history rather than Mary Shelly's

Frankenstein . A students eagerness to learn in specific topics strengthens their work and ensures their growth and success before the new school year.

Equally as important as topic diversity is topic delivery. Reading a book and writing a paper confirming your completion year after year does little to stimulate a students brain. Offering students the creative freedom to complete their summer project will further invest them into their topic. Say a student is interested in film and designs their project on studying its evolution; instead of writing a paper, the student could make a video presentation featuring different clips and information. Allowing students to broaden their horizons will encourage critical thinking and result in a more stimulated head space when returning to school.

Another important consideration is whether or not students can access the necessary resources to complete a teacher-designed project. Several high school students are not fortunate enough to purchase a summer-reading book, supplies for a poster board, or the internet to construct a paper. When completing the project isn't a viable option, the opportunity to design their own allows them to use resources already available to them and avoid lowering their grade.

Although student-designed summer projects are proven to aid learning in more ways than one, schools are still hesitant to make the shift. Teachers rebuttal saying teacher-designed projects would provide students with relevant prep work for their next course and avoid any inappropriate topics that fail to exhibit student growth. Students agreed and offered to solve the inevitable conflict: students have the option of of either completing a teacher-designed project or designing and their own as long as it is teacher-approved prior to schools end.

Maintaining academic activity is key to achieving higher grades and retaining long term information. Even in the summer, students should practice this with assigned summer projects. Though teacher-designed projects aid a students transition into the next year, these projects can be repetitive and may struggle to entice or stimulate students. When students themselves design one, however, the passion for their topics, creative delivery, and avoiding any hindrance on unavailable necessities allow them to learn while still fulfilling what summer is all about: having fun!",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
81AD1F069407,"Benefits of Student-designed Projects

Summer projects are to keep students learning during summer break but most kids don't find the projects entertaining. Student-designed projects can improve their creativity and make them want to complete the project. Also, teachers will be more excited and looking forward to seeing the outcome of students work. Schools should really think about making more projects student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because more students will want to participate, increase creativity, and boost their self-esteem.

In schools, participation from students is very important and student-designed summer projects are a great way to increase excitement and participation. If students could come up with their own projects and enjoy the work that they are doing, plenty of other students will want to do the project. In addition, students will see their peers coming up with their own kind of project and will want to join in by making a project themselves. For example, a student can see one of their friends making a project and can tell that the friend is having fun while doing it. This will encourage the student to join in on the student-designed project and make them want to do the project more. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.

Secondly, student-designed projects can increase creativity throughout students. Projects already help with creativity but having a student design a project can really increase it. For example, my art teacher had the class come up with different ideas for our next piece of art work. There were so many creative thoughts going around that my teacher had us make our own unique thing. As I worked on the project, I could really see my creative side show and everybody else's too. Having students design their own projects for the summer is really good for the next school year. For instance, students developing and finding out how creative that can be will improve grades and talent. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.

Self-esteem is an important factor in the real world, having students design a project can help them improve their confidence. A student knowing that they completed a project, they've made, will make them proud of themselves. In addition, using the project in other classes, and getting recognized for designing a good project will drastically increase their self-esteem. Students-design summer projects will increasingly let students know that they can do any thing they put their minds too. Self-confidence will provide students with better outcomes, motivation and even they will feel more confident in the work they are putting out. In this paragraph, I proved that summer projects should be student-designed.

Some opponents believe that teacher-designed projects should be used for summer projects. Also, they may feel as if it will be easy on students and a better way of learning. However, giving students a easy way isn't always the best thing to do. Having students design a project has better outcomes in the long run. For example, having a teacher design a project and give it to students may not help students become more creative or participate or even gain self-esteem from it. So, a teacher-design project for the summer, in my eyes, is not the best thing to have students grow and improve in certain positions.

In conclusion, keeping students active and learning during the summer by having student-design projects has plenty of benefits. In addition, this can have a better impact on students as well as be more exciting and entertaining to students. Three benefits for student-design summer projects are it will make students want to participate, increase creativity, and boost their self-esteem. This proves that summer projects should be student-designed.  ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
04EB912FE84F,"As a child, I, as well as most others, desperately counted the days until summer break. In the classroom, we had a bright, beach themed poster board with the school days remaining plastered in big, bold letters in the middle. On my sports teams, we always had fun and easy practices during the last week of school. I always looked forward to summer, especially when everyone else was so enthusiastic about it. However, this changed as I got older when I was introduced to summer assignments. They felt like the exact opposite of summer. They were boring and restrictive, so I always procrastinated doing them until the very end. Today, many school systems are looking to implement summer projects, as they can help tackle the lost and wasted time during the summer. Simultaneously, it is important that schools don't impose overly restrictive projects that take away what it means to be on summer break. One solution to this is to implement student-designed projects. These allow students to create what they want their summer project to be. Although many may say teacher-designed summer projects better preserve the students' learning, student-designed projects are overall superior because they give more freedom, creativity, and flexibility for the students during their summer break.

Student-designed summer projects are a phenomenal chance to give students more freedom and let them be creative. In school, students have very few opportunities to express their creativity, so summer break is seen by many as a chance to break away from overly structured school days. Forcing students to follow a teacher-designed project will only remove its specialty, and further limit chances students have to be creative. On the other hand, student-designed projects could be the spark needed by some to make use of their summer. Additionally, if students feel the teacher-designed projects were too restrictive, there is a chance they would put as little effort into them as possible, or forgo them entirely. If this happens, it is a waste of time for both the student and the teacher. In my own experience, I have seen that most summer assignments had very little or no impact on my grade, so it often made far more sense not to do them. However, when teachers did try to tie these assignments to a grade, lots of students and parents complained. Whereas, when students are able to design a project about something they are passionate about, this is far less likely to happen, and could even lead to further interest about that topic.

Another important aspect of summer projects is the various time restraints every student has. Students may have sports, vacations, jobs, and many other activities. Designing a project which accommodates everyone's complex and ever-changing needs can be impossible. By allowing students to design the project, much of this problem is eliminated. They know the time they have better than anyone else, so they can design a project which fits far better to their own schedule. If students were able to design their own projects, they could even tie it into the activities they're already doing. This way, they're able to gain the benefits of a summer project, while not having to change much about their summer. Not having enough time is another reason why some students may not do their summer project, but can have other, additional, consequences. With a teacher-designed project, if students don't have the time to complete it, they may look towards cheating off of others, since everyone is following the same project. This not only negates any benefits of a summer project, but can also lead to some downsides. If a student cheats on a summer project because they didn't have the time to do it, they may feel encouraged to cheat again in the future, even if they wouldn't have otherwise. With a student-designed project, cheating is much less of a problem. Not only are there far fewer reasons to cheat, but it's much harder to as well, since every student has their own project, they can't simply copy off of what someone else has done.

Many people may say that teacher-designed projects would be far better to maintain students' learning and allow them to learn new things, but this is untrue. It is far easier for students to learn new things if it's about a topic they're interested about; whereas, students may not absorb any knowledge about a topic they have no interest in. Even if student-designed projects were worse for learning, their other benefits still outweigh their downsides. Student-designed projects are a great way to develop creativity, and they let students with naturally high creativity use it, which they aren't given many chances to in school. Student-designed projects are also much better for students' time constraints, which will encourage more students to do the project.

As more school systems begin to adopt summer projects, it is crucial that these projects are student-designed. Summer projects are important to build and preserve learning from throughout the year, but are extremely limiting on students freedom, creativity, and flexibility. By giving students the capability to design their own projects, it restores much of what is lost by giving them summer work. Student-designed projects also help to avoid many of the possible downsides of teacher-designed ones. Because of the lack of freedom and the inability to tailor a project to everyone schedule, teacher-designed projects can often lead to students cheating, or not doing the work at all. By putting students in the driver's seat of their own project, they can find a project that is enjoyable and encourages themselves to do it. By using student-designed projects, schools can obtain the needed balanced between a useful summer and an enjoyable one.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
C7FA88E9DF3B,"Have you ever been assigned a project that you did not want to work on? This regularly happens to many students, due to a variety of reasons. Although summer projects are slightly different than those assigned during the school year, they cause similar problems. The student might have been lazy, did not have enough time to work on the project, or the topic did not interest them. While schools cannot help much with the former two reasons, they can with the latter reason. Teacher-designed projects can be biased, affecting the student's ability to gain a wide understanding of a topic. Additionally, teachers tend to assign projects on topics that students do not see much importance in, as the topic does not seem to affect the student in any way. For these reasons, summer projects should be student-designed to allow students to be more passionate about the project, be creative, and be more self-reliable.

Student-designed projects allow students to be passionate about the topic they are working on, causing them to work efficiently. When students are assigned teacher-designed projects, they are not usually excited to work on the assignment. Additionally, they do not value it as important, leaving the work until the last minute. For example, in 7th grade, my Life Science class was assigned a project about the deer population in Virginia. Many of the students did not actively work on the project, as they found the topic boring. Because they did not understand the relevance of the topic, the students were not passionate about the project. An independent project assigned in my AP Lang class, however, had a different result. The assignment was to write a research paper on a social issue that interested us. Because students were able to write about an issue that interests them, they actively worked on the project. Being passionate about a project also affects a student's performance in class. For example, because the majority of the class was not passionate about the deer project, they did not do well on it. However, on the AP Lang assignment, the majority of the class did well on related assignments, as they were passionate about the projects they worked on.

Summer projects designed by students allow for creativity. Students are able to express themselves, as they are not restricted by strict guidelines the way they are with teacher-designed projects. Because of this reason, students are more likely to actively work on the project and put in more effort. For example, my AOS biology class was assigned a project to research and present information about a group of proteins. We were allowed to present this information in any way we wanted, allowing for creativity. The majority of the students were very excited to work on the project, as they thought of fun ways to present their information. Some students created songs to relay their information, whereas others made fun videos to do so. A few students even baked cakes to provide information about their proteins. Each student actively worked on their project and put in effort to make sure it was done well. The element of creativity allowed the students to see the assignment as a fun project, rather than as a boring task. Because the majority of the students worked hard on the project, they did well on it. Furthermore, they effectively retained the information they researched, allowing them to do well on the corresponding test.

By allowing projects to be student-designed, schools allow students to develop a sense of self-reliance. This is because the students have to conduct their own research in order to find a topic that interests them, rather than just receive a topic from the teacher. For example, in elementary school, students come up with their own experiments to test, after which they present their findings at the science fair. By doing so, students learn how to depend on themselves to find information. Similarly, sophomores at the Generic_School take a research class. They work on a wide variety of projects that are mostly assigned by teachers, but towards the end of the year, they must come up with an independent research project that they will work on in their junior year. In order to choose their project, students have to conduct extensive research to understand the topic, as their project cannot have been done before. Additionally, they have to continue conducting research in junior year to allow for a wider understanding of the topic. This allows the students to be self-reliant, as they know more about their project than their teacher, who acts as a mentor. Self-reliance is a very important skill that helps people succeed in the community and workplace when they become an adult, so it is important to establish the skill early on.

Some people may believe that allowing students to design their own projects creates more work for teachers, putting stress on them. The teachers cannot have a uniform grading rubric and must have enough background knowledge on each student's topic in order to grade them fairly. However, by allowing summer projects to be student-designed, teachers do not have to come up with a topic themselves. Additionally, they are exposed to a wide variety of projects, allowing them to be more interested in the presented material. This allows teachers to be more likely to grade the projects fairly, as they do not have to repeatedly look at the same information.

In conclusion, self-designed projects allow students to be passionate about the topic, resulting in the creation of better projects. Students can demonstrate their creativity, allowing them to effectively retain the learned information. They also become more self-reliant, which will help them when they get a job. Rather than assigning teacher-designed projects over the summer, schools should assign student-designed projects to stimulate learning, as well as shape students to gain skills that will help them succeed when they become an adult.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
43C6275B5CC8,"These summer projects should be student designed for sure. It shows which students who are willing to apply themselves and show how creative they are, which would separate them from the rest. This would in return create a bias with the teacher.

If summer projects were designed in such a way where the student led their own idea with what to do with said topic, this would ulimtatly separate students from each other. I refer to this as ""the breaking point"". I refer to it as ""the breaking point"" because it shows which students who are willing to apply themselves, who are trying with mediocre effort or don't care at all. It builds discipline and character. If you are willing enough to take the extra mile and go out of your way to make this project the best ever, then that proves to your teacher that you are the one who wants it, you are the one to ask questions, you are the one to make it. Some students would probably set them self up for failure and try to find the easy way too workout around said project. All this shows is that they wish to take the wide path that life has set before us and not the narrow path with temptations that build that discipline. This project should be meant for who wants it, not for what its really on. It should basically be an assessment to see what level of goat they are on.

Now there is a very great con to my argument. That con my friend has a name, and her name is, bias. With going with the plan on doing said project create a very huge bias within teachers. Once they see who was very willing to apply themselves and who wasn't, they'll most likely start to prematurely pick and choose favorites. I say this because they'll start to imagine how well this student will do in their class and how terrible the next would. Come school time, the kids won't know it, but the teacher already has a secret disliking for some of the students. It's to hell with them basically. It's hard for us students to overcome such a bias from a mistake we made. Even if we start acing the teachers class, they'll probably jump to conclusions and assume we have cheated all year or something. This project is a great cause with two possible outcomes: A great upbringing or a terrible downfall. But see, you might have though that I am swaying you away from actual argument but here's where the good comes in. This project brings out the teachers true character as well, we can see if the teacher is really loving as people say they are no matter what, or will their true colors show? This whole thing is one big assessment on everyone's moral values. Are you a fan or a hater?

In conclusion, life is what it is. Bias or not, let the kids show who they are and who THEY want to be. Don't allow teachers to solely let the do what they want but instead let a student explore his mental. Let us breathe and thrive in life. Let us learn from our own mistake and not be carried on the shoulders of someone else. I would like to end this passage with a qoute I made myself.

926AD76F8E36,"Summer vacation is a time of rest, relaxation, and recreation for public school students across the nation. However, this break is also well-known for creating significant academic setbacks for these students and causing them to struggle in their return to school. To solve this common issue, many schools have started to require their students to complete a summer project in order to maintain their academics outside of school. Although these projects would be more educationally beneficial for the students if constructed by the teachers, the summer projects should be student-made because the students are more likely to enjoy the project, there is a higher probability of the students completing the project, and the efforts of the students to do a high-quality project are increased.

To begin with, the summer break projects should be constructed by the students because they are more likely to enjoy the project. In today's society, many students enjoy creating things that they thought of themselves and were not assigned by a teacher or parent. Consequently, if these projects were created by teachers, the students would say that the topic that the teachers selected for the project was not interesting enough and would not be as motivated to complete the assignment. If these projects were created by the students, they would not feel forced to do the project. Instead, they would leave for summer vacation already anticipating starting this fun and exciting new activity. In conclusion, schools should allow students to create their own summer project because the students are more likely to enjoy it.

In addition, the allowance of a student-constructed summer project would increase the probability of completion by the students. If the students are permitted to complete a project of their own invention, their motivation to do it will increase because they are guaranteed to enjoy the topic of the project. Teacher-constructed projects are not likely to suit the interests of each of their students. This results in a percentage of the students not enjoying the topic of the project, losing motivation to do what was assigned, and eventually not completing the project at all. This can be avoided if the topic of the summer project was student-selected because each student would be doing something that they are interested in. To conclude, students should be allowed to select their own summer project instead of the teachers selecting it because their motivation to complete the project is guaranteed to increase significantly.

Finally, schools should permit students to pick their own summer project because the chance that students will construct a project of higher quality will increase. Students completing a project that they are interested in are proven to spend more time and effort on their assignment. Forcing students to construct a project that they are not interested in is the easiest way to receive a low-quality project. In order to prevent students from creating an unambitious and lazily-made project, schools should permit students to choose what project they will be doing. This ensures that every student is doing something that they will be guaranteed to enjoy. To summarize, the allowance of student-constructed projects increases the probability that schools will receive high-quality projects on their return.

In conclusion, the summer projects should be student-made because the students are more likely to enjoy the project, there is a higher probability of the students completing the project, and the efforts of the students to complete a high-quality project are increased. The projects mandated by these schools will create a new generation of inquisitive and ambitious students. The students who complete these interactive and enjoyable projects are more probable to enjoy school on their return and have an increase in motivation and ambition regarding their academics. Allowing the students to construct these summer break projects instead of the teachers is the best possible decision that America's schools could ever make for the future generations of today's society.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
6A437891CA7F,"For many students, summer projects are a useless task forced upon them by their teachers. These assignments can be detrimental to the continuity of the students' learning. Without the freedom to stray from the normal, one may become expectant of nothing more. Student led assignments give highschoolers the opportunity to be creative in their learning, learn responsibility, and prepare them for the future.

During the school year, students are expected to learn through the guidance of the teacher. While some people enjoy this structure, many feel their creativity is being repressed. A survey done on high schools students, asking about how they feel they have the ability to represent themselves through schoolwork, 75% feel that they do not have the option to express themselves with their current workload. With a self-led summer project students could continue learning through the break, by studying a topic that interests them which, in turn, inspires them to create a more thought out end result.

Responsibility, a skill hopefully learned by students through school, is not easy to become proficient at. And with many teachers setting deadlines and giving extensions, students can lose responsibility without trial and error. A psychological study that followed five students' grades and work style throughout four years portrayed the effect that self-led projects had on students before they left for college. Teenagers who had no control over their learning, while seemingly successful with their grades, lacked development on the section of the brain that controls creativity and responsibility. However, students who worked with their teachers on their course of study had better developed this section. These skills not only help students grow as self-thinkers, but as responsible and thoughtful human beings.

In many ways, the future for today's children is unlike the life they live now in school. There will no longer be someone to give them instructions for every task, and many projects are completely controlled and monitored by the person creating it. School is designed to prepare students for the real world, yet many find themselves lost by the time they must complete their own study or presentation in college. While it may be difficult to recreate these circumstances in high school, a summer project gives students adequate time to thoroughly research and involve themselves in their project. One may find themselves discovering new topics that they were not previously aware of. Whereas without the freedom to follow their own direction, they would become trapped with the same topic and format as everyone else.

Free thinking is an important skill to have once you're an adult, and student-designed projects support the formation of this skill. The opportunity to express themselves through their learning is essential to the development of useful, creative habits that can be extremely helpful for the future of the world.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
5484CC372842,"Summer break is that time of the year where most students look forward to. Many are eager to sit back and relax, or enjoy their time with friends and family. Whatever it is, school is the last thing on their mind. It's the last thing on my mind too. Although that isn't always the case, there is always that one teacher that assigns projects over break. Summer projects are required through some schools to preserve their learning onto the next year. To make it more enjoyable, I believe that these summer projects should at least be student-designed for various reasons.

Summer break is the time where most students proceed to pursue hobbies, enjoy lifes moments, spend time with people that are cared about, and make memorial memories. Over break, students tend to discover their true passions and focus on what drives their interest. With projects being assigned, that can be tough and build a wedge between the situation. If summer projects were to be student-designed however, students can make it more personalized and just have fun with it. I believe making the summer projects more personalized to students, can really ease the stress and make it more enjoyable. Overall, it is summer break. As a student myself, a time where this applied to me was in the summer of my freshman year. My teacher had assigned a summer project where we had to determine the area of different shapes in any form. Art is a huge passion of mine and I wanted to engage more of it into my summer. I decided to paint an abstract painting with a variety of shapes; circles, triangles, squares, you name it. It turned out beautiful, I really enjoyed spending my time on something that was educating and delightful. Engaging learning with enjoyable hobbies can be beneficial for the teachers' satisfactory and the students.

For most people, finding hobbies that are interesting can be challenging. Knowing myself, I need a sense of direction to know what my interests. It takes a bit of courage to try something new and actually enjoy it. Student designed school projects can really help a student find his/her passions and learn something new along the way. An example of this is Generic_Name. When Generic_Name was younger, she stayed in a hostel and went to an all girls catholic school. Although the classes were given to her and the staff controlled her schedule, she found a way to have a passion for computers. Her summer assignment was to find am interest to occupy her for the upcoming summer. She began to observe her fathers work and grew an interest for how computers work. Today, she works in the computer coding world and enjoys every second of it. With enough interest, there is always something new just waiting to be discovered, who knows maybe you'll learn something new on the way. Student designed school projects can help one into discovering a new passion.

Although students might think making school projects student-designed is a good idea, teachers might not agree. Some students could take this their advantage, by making the project as simple and pointless as they want. This could necessarily not reach the teachers standards and question if the student even learned anything at all. Although this could be case, summer projects are indeed just summer projects and should not be taken seriously. Summer should be the time where students can have the choice of doing what they want. If projects are mandatory for teachers, then it can be arranged, but it shouldn't put unnecessary stress on students. Especially during summer break. Teachers should observe how well the student comes up with ideas and how well they execute their projects, it's more exciting that way.

Having being said, student designed projects are better for both the student and the teacher. It allows students to have more freedom and personalize their studies with their occupation. Teachers will also have the chance to determine the students personality and see what the student is like. It shows how bright a student's mind can be and how well their work ethics are. Teachers should give students a chance to show off themselves and appreciate for what they are able to achieve in. It can also be a fun learning experience for many. Not only will these student-designed projects continue their learning throughout break, it will also preserve any sort of creativity a student could withhold.           ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
BE5D3ADC4F2B,"How would a student feel if they had to endure a lesson during the summer by a immature kid? Summer assignments have been implicated in student's daily lives since 7th grade. The theory is that if teachers provide students with a summer assignment, they will be ready for the classroom in the fall. However, there is a rise in the education department where they have to see if it is really benifical for the younger generation to have their assignments designed by a teacher or a student. The pratical answer for this discussion would be to have a teacher-designed summer assignment because it will prepare the students for their class, strengthn their abilities, and open their eyes to what the future would look like going into higher education.

Learning the material by someone who is already trained in this profession will help prepare the students for the year since the teacher is the one who is going to help them get a wide range of education. It will be more benifical if the students learn this way because its going to get them ready for the year. For example, if a math teacher gives a student a summer project that they designed they will already have a planned idea of what is going to be in the next school year. This will let the young adults see what they will be doing in the following school year which in turn can help the student understand if this class is the right clas for them.

Not to mention, if the summer assignments were teacher-designed it will give the students the oppurtunity to learn more about their strengths and weaknesses. In the school system more than 85% of the school's population have struggled in one or two subjects. Moreover, that means students will have a harder time grasping certain subjects when the school year begins. If the assignments where created by the teacher then they will have an easier time at the beginning of the year to understand what the student is struggling with. Moreover, it could also help the student by getting the student to think more about what they struggle with and how they can grow upon it since it is an independent project.

However, since it is a summer assignment, students would not be as motivated to do the work since it is an extended amount of time ot do a minimal activity. As teens go into summer they do not worry about the summer assignment and get this feeling of procrastination with the certain activity. 95% of teens around the world struggle with this thought and wait until the last minute. Which could be damaging to the students education.

Since procrastionation occurs it would be more likely for students to cheat. However, making the assignment teacher designed and giving it time stamps of when it is due during the summer will force students to deal with time managment. Moreover, if we allow our children to be interactive with teacher-designed assignments, then they will be more prepared for the future. For example, if an english teacher decides to make a summer assignment and put certain due dates during the summer rather then giving them a student-designed activity; It will give the student a chance to learn about what it means to have responsibilities. Which is important because it will make sure that students can be independent with their jobs.

The debate on whether or not summer assignments should be designed by a certain person has shown the community what really is important in this society. Our educators wanna make sure that the students will be prepared for what is coming to them, especially if they are taking an AP course. Moreover, it will shine light to some of the weaknesses in a student early on so the educator can help them with this skill. Likewise, it can also make the young adults open to ideas of having important responsiblities so they will be ready for the workforce. No matter what occurs in life, educators should make sure that they are guiding the new generation to a bright and happy future. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
78AF7BDB9CE8,"Many students tend to forget or struggle when their teachers assign them with projects over the summer. Students should design their own projects because teachers don't know what students do over the summer and students want to have fun and want to enjoy it more than having to still do school work. This lets students create a project that will allow them to manage how much time they can set into doing school work and have more time enjoying their break. Letting students choose helps them by setting it at a level that they can work at without struggle and make it easier for them.

Students creating a student-designed project will allow them to manage time better with what they can work on during the summer and have more time enjoying their break. Most students like to travel over the break and sometimes they can't do it abroad and don't have much time when they come back. For example: ""I went to El Salvador with my father and he lives in the country side, in his house he doesn't have wifi but does have cable. Coming back I only had five days to do it before I had to go back to middle school."" Students wouldn't be able to do any school work because they could probably not have internet access and want to enjoy their time visiting.

Students can design their project and making it easier by doing: a summary over a couple of simple novels, do a short essay over a easy and simple prompt, do research over patterns in nature like, looking at moon patterns for two weeks or observe temperatures for a period amount of time and do a study on it when they come back. For example: "" I had a simple project to recorded what the moon looked like at night, every night for a week and draw it. This was easy and simple for me to do and i still learned a lot from it from observing that the moon slowly phases through each night through its cycle."" Even doing small simple projects, students can still learn and discover new things because they don't have to stress about it and its something most students should be able to do.

Someone might say, Teachers select projects that they think is good for students and it's better for a teacher to have control over it because they know their students best, expects them to do their best, accomplish it and that challenging them is good so they don't forget what they learned; however, that's not the case, really what teachers don't know sometimes, and what makes students have a hard time or take a long time on projects is that, teachers want to assign projects to what they think their students can do and put them at a challenging level or a process that takes a long time but students want to have it simple over the summer has they don't have class with other students and don't meet their teachers anymore so they can't ask for help. Students don't need to stress out over the summer by what their teachers assign, letting students decide lets them be creative and discover with what they chose to do.

In conclusion, Student-designed projects, will encourage and help students with work and still learn from it as the teacher wanted for them to learn in the students own creative way.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
A476784AFAFE,"Is not three months of summer break a very long time to stay away from school work? The summer break is very discussed by people because for some, it is a very long period were people can relax and take a break from the school season. Some students prefer to plan an own program to refresh some topics and other prefer to have a program designated by the teachers. Altrought complete summer projects designed by the teachers for a school purpose during the summer break could dissappoint a lot of students, the teachers know which topic the students have to focus on, and be ready to go back in school as better as possible, for the next school year.

Having a big vision of the development that the student did during the year, the teachers are the best individuals to assign project to work on and refresh on what has been done.

In this case, student have a complete plan to work on and view where they have problems or concerns and be able to get feedback from the teachers. They do not have to spend time in researching in which topics they want to focus, havind a designed plan that cover most of them. Doing the entire work assigated, students could get more confidence and be prepared for the next year. Baing more prepared for the next year, they could take advanced classes and get more credits from it.

The students who complete the entire practice could get a grade for the project itself and another one for the partecipation. This poiunt could could involve students in be active during the summer doing the project designated by the teachers reciving feedbacks and a starter grade for the next year. The teacher giving assignated projects could even give some prequerisits for the units that they are going to go over and do not lose time on them during the beginning of the year.

Complete assigments and project during the school break is the best way to restart the next school year. Infact it could prevent a lot of time that usually is spent on reviewing the previous school program. The teachers are the people that most know about wath the students are going to study the following year, so they can designed the right assignement to focus on during the break.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
141CC621E949,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure the continue learning during the break. Should the assignments be student designed or teacher designed. I feel as it should be teacher designed because some people wouldn't know what to come with, It would make it easier because they are more familiar to teacher designed assignments, and most students wouldnt do it because its not teacher designed.

First, most students would feel as it's easier because it's teacher designed and thats what they are familiar to. For example, The teacher gave us students designed projects and we really didn't know what to do. So when the time came for us to turn it in, the class really didn't get a good grade.

Another reason, is some people wouldn't know what to come with. In this movie i've watched the teacher had assigned projects to certain groups and this one group couldn't think of anything. So they went to each others houses and would think about what they should do and before they knew it, it was time for the project to be turned in. The next day had came and the teacher put in the grades they all had zeroes. It could have benefits though because assigning students designed projects it can help them later on in life, they could get a job where they have to do the designing.

Finally, most students wouldn't do it because it wasn't teacher designed and they were being lazy. Since they had to do more work they would be lazy and wouldn't do it. I know other students and including myself, that didn't do an assignment because it wasn't teacher designed and we had to do more work and think more. So most of got zeroes.

Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure the continue learning during the break. Should the assignments be student designed or teacher designed. I feel as it should be teacher designed because some people wouldn't know what to come with, It would make it easier because they are more familiar to teacher designed assignments, and most students wouldnt do it because its not teacher designed. Those are my reasons why the summer project shouldn't be student assigned if you have any you should add on.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
2671F96E9F5F,"In many schools today, teachers assigning school projects over the summer for students to complete has become quite apparent. Teacher are doing this to have students stay focused even during the summer. Teachers can give one of two assignments; either a teacher specific assignment where every student has to complete roughly the same project with roughly the same outcome that has very little room for variation, or they assign a student ran assignment that allows the student to do a project in something they have interest for and it can be quite personalized. Teacher projects usually are stricter in there guidelines and make the student typically work harder even if the student may not want to do that much work while student driven projects can have many students work extremely hard on something they have passion for. The only problem is you will usually have a slacker in student designed project that will always do the minimum. I see student projects to have better benefits for students as for those that want and enjoy putting in the work for something they are really interested in they will see more accomplishment out of that. Others may that teacher designed projects are better because they force ever student to work but they are wrong because the drive for success should come from the student not the teacher. Summer student designed projects are better for the student that teacher designed projects because it allows for students to take part in the design process and then execute a product of something that a student is generally interested in.

Summer projects or studying in the summer will always be super beneficial for your education. It allows for you to stay alert and prepared for the next school year. Just studying in the summer alone can make getting into the next year that much easier. Summer projects can be really beneficial to students. In some cases it can allow students to have more a variety in options for there project than doing one in the school year. For example; a teacher assigns an entire class to do a research project on a single type of invasive plant species prevalent in his/her state and they will have to present that in class at the beginning of the year. I take issue with this because it is quite restrictive on what the student can research as its limited to only one plant you can do, and many students will likely pick the same plant. Plus the students have very little do in terms of the creative process in how they want to gather data. If I were the teacher I would have given a project on invasives in the state(allowing for multiple plants to be studied.)and not limit it to just a research project. This allows for a students to really to be flexible and learn more. Students can now have the opportunity to organize community events for conservation. Students can make test plots at a park to see what removal method works best. Students can now study multiple plants at once to compare and create statistics and find out which are the most deadly and hard to remove. Students also have the choice to help with college students on finding new ways of removing said plant from our area and eventually at the state level. Students can also go really ind depth into a plant they find super interesting and they can find the true science as to why they continue to grow so fast. The possibilities are endless.

They best part is when it comes down to the presentation. It is very likely that majority of students will have different projects; some may have similar ones but very different findings so its really interesting to see a students, growth, trial, and success through the process of completing the project. While also talking about their final conclusion they should also discuss about how they changed in grew as a person and about what skills they earned that they can use later in their life. Students can truly learn new concepts off of other students. If students were tasked with completing the teacher created project, the majority of students would really not have learned as much from each other.

This was only an example. The possibilities for student lead/created projects are endless because in comes from the student. The example mentioned was limited to conservation but there are student projects have to be. There are projects that can allow students to really branch out and potentially inspire them to their future careers. Students designed projects give students the chance to be a leader and be of something meaningful to them personally. Anyone can complete a project when it comes from a teacher but if it comes from student it can really create growth. These students will have plenty of time to complete their project as the have an entire summer to do so. The summer should not be a stressful time but it shouldnt be a time slack off and not grow in your learning. Everyday we are learning. Maybe its time for you to help someone else learning. Student designed projects give students the chance to prepare themselves for future challenges in the adult world. Others say that student designed projects dont push students enough to really create a product worthwhile; they are wrong because if a student truly care they will go above and beyond to see the it is completed full to the best of their ability.

80667AD3FFD8,"Some schools require summer projects for students; these projects need to be student designed. When teachers plan a project some students don't enjoy completing the assigned task. For students to learn they have to be interested in what they are doing. There are many ways to assign a school project, it could be hands on, writing, individually, in groups etc. Each student has different skills, they should do a project that best fits that skill to succeed. Summer projects need to be student designed so that they are more motivated to complete the assignment, to have fun with the assignment and to have interest in the task.

Summer projects need to be student designed to enhance motivation. When students are motivated this encodes the topic in their memory. When students are motivated they get better grades, the project is better quality and students do the project to their best ability. As a student when a project gets assigned and I am not interested in the assignment I try to get it done as quickly as possible and put no effort into it. I end up getting a lower grade. Students will also want to keep working on the project if they are motivated to complete it. With more time spent on the project this equals better quality and higher grades. Students won't procrastinate if the project interests them and will be motivated to start the project early. As a student in High School lots of students procrastinate when given a project. If projects were student designed this would motivate them to learn about the topic.

Summer projects need to be student designed so that they have fun with it. If they had fun with the assignment then they would have a memory of their experience. If schools made learning fun they are more likely to remember the topic of the project. If students were in a group for the project this would enhance team work skills if they had fun. As a student I found out that if I had fun learning about a certain topic I remember it more clearly and can connect it to other things in life.

Summer projects need to be student designed to have students have interest in the topic. This would help students explore their interests that they never knew they were interested in. This may help students what they want to do after graduation. Chances are if a student is really interested in what they learned in class then they might explore that topic outside of school. When I had a project assigned to me that I was interested in I enjoyed completing the project and continued to learn more about it outside of school. Summer projects that have students interested is a key to success in their academic career.

In conclusion, summer projects need to be student designed so that they look forward to working on the assignment, enjoy completing the task and continue learning about the topic outside of school. Some people say that projects should be teacher designed they are wrong because students then dont get the freedom of doing what they enjoy most. It also isn't equal to all students. For example, a teacher assigns a research paper on a certain topic, some students have a love for writing and it is their strength and others don't like to write. This is why student designed projects are important. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
F07695ECF99C,"Summer projects are notorious for being not only extremely uninteresting, but incredibly easy to put off. While teachers have tried to find ways of captivating students by giving a variety of choices or making it more hands on, they always miss the real reason why students seems to loathe these assignments. I believe that it all comes down to student choice. Society teaches us that we are all different in our own ways and that people want to do different things, but this is not demonstrated in our schools. A step forward into integrating more individual-focused work is by starting off with one of the most hated assignments for all children, summer projects. Having student-designed projects would give students the chance to explore topics they're interested in, control over how they want they're project to turn out, and incentives creative thinking.

The most common response I get from my peers when we get a project over the summer is, ""Why would I need to know about this?"". This leads to them not caring about the outcome of their assignment and putting minimal effort into it, thus leading to lackluster scores. This could be absolved by letting them choose what they want to learn more about. Seeing that it is the summertime, I believe that students shouldn't be tied down to one subject, but use their break to learn whatever they feel that they need to put more time into. Even if it has to revolve around one subject, they should have the option to include aspects of other subjects that they would find more enjoyable. Giving them the option to choose where they want their time to be spent would open up different avenues for them to take their learning.

Students want more control over how they want their work to turn out. Giving strict restraints on how the project should be about and its formatting disincentives students who work at a slower pace and holds back those who work faster. Rather than molding the student to fit into the curriculum, make the curriculum easier to mold. Give students the best opportunity to grow and succeed rather than holding them to a set standard that all can't meet. We all have different preferences and learning levels and our work should reflect those differences.

Letting them design their own projects would challenge them to think creatively. With the option to take aspects of multiple subjects and to illustrate it in a precise manner, you would have to think of creative ways to present it. This would force students to think carefully about what information they want to include and the undertones that it could have, just like in real world presentations. With the choices that would be given to them, students would have to find the right combination of formats and subjects that would most accurately reflects their goal.

While some would say that it could lead to students choosing the easiest route, I believe this comes from a place of little faith. Given the chance to learn more about something that actually interests them, I think that most students would jump on the chance. The reason why students, especially high school students, seem so apathetic is that we aren't interested. We feel as if we're just going through the motions of school and that summer projects are just a way to bleed more of our time away. The problem isn't the student, but how the system is set in place.

Summer projects have always been a chore to do. From the uninteresting topics, to the fact that it's during the summer has always made students dread, but if these projects were designed by the students, I think we would see a sharp spike in enthusiasm around their arrival. Being able to choose the topic, have control over how it turns out, and the need to actually think creatively would excite students and teachers alike. Giving us the chance to express ourselves would be the right direction for summer projects.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
F345A408922D,"Although some may believe that school projects should be designed by a student it should be known that Teachers should be the project designer. Teachers should be the project designer because teachers have a better chance of making a better and curious project. Not only that but some students dont have the time to work on a project,some have to work, go to sport practice. Teachers should be the project designer because teachers can list all the wed-sites and information you need to complete the project. Students wouldn't have the right tools to be a project designer. Another reason teachers should be the project designer because teachers won't make the project easy. The project is more fun when the teacher make the project more fun and challening. If the teacher as the project designer make the project easy then it won't be hard trying to complete the project. Last for not lease the reason teachers should be the project designer is because the project would be organized. For example the more organized the steps are the more easy it is to complete a project and students designer love rushing when doing things while being destracted and the project is not finished. Some schools require students to complete summer project to assure they continune learning during their break.",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
A27F8CE559C8,"Over the summer, the majority of students will forget the core lessons they learned; therefore, some teachers decide to give students summer projects to keep information fresh in their minds. There is an ongoing debate over whether teachers should choose the summer projects for students, or if the assignment should be the ideas of the student themselves. There are those that say that it would be better for teachers to assign their own project, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer projects.

There are a variety of reason why students should create their own summer project. First and foremost, it inspires creativity. When a teacher assigns their own cut-and-paste project, this removes most creativity from the assignment. Students need to practice creative skills, and the low stress environment of summer is a perfect time for doing that. Additionally, students having their own project idea allows them to do what they want to do. This is obviously beneficial because the student can choose the subject that they are best at, which will improve the quality of the summer project. Also, giving the student the choice on what they want to do makes the project enjoyable, which is important considering that it is summer break. Finally, allowing students to assign their own project ideas motivates the student to actually do it. It is very common to witness teachers giving direct instructions on how the class should do something in a certain way, only for the students to lose interest. On the other hand, giving students their own unique project can inspire them to complete it with actual effort.

There are additional reason why students should create their own summer projects. For instance, the student can use real world examples that they are familiar and can easily understand. Most teachers, especially ones in larger schools, will not know the student's personal interests and experience very well. Students can take inspiration, data, and ideas from their surroundings during the summer, which can make for an excellent project. Another reason students should design their own summer projects is that it creates less stress for the teacher. If students are making their own projects, it will make the job of teachers easier since they dont have to create unique prompts for each student. Additionally, each student having their own personally crafted project will get rid of the possibility of cheating, something they have would have if students were all to have the same assignment. Lastly, students creating their own summer projects will prepare them for the future. In college, many assignments given by your professor will be self directed, meaning you will need practice in creating your own ideas for projects. Careers also rely on creativity, innovations need to be made for more efficient work, which can earn you promotions.

Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer projects. This is the case due to less overall stress, motivation for students, and inspiration for creativity and innovation. There are those that say teachers should design the project for the student because the teacher knows what the student needs to learn, what the school board wants, and what the student will learn the following year, but this is not the case. It's true teachers need to encourage creativity in and outside the classroom, but students also should enjoy their summer break after a hard school year. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
AE1EA7A93322,"Summer assignments are important to help students continue learning over the summer. This is why these assignments should be designed by teachers, rather than students. This is due to the fact that teachers are going to assign challenging projects, which most students would not; additionally, teachers may use this assignment as a way to prepare the students for the following year.

Everyone wants to enjoy their summer break, go on vacations, and chill at the beach. Summer assignments are a great way to put a pause on the fun. Knowing this, students are not going to purposefully give themselves a challenging project that could benefit them in the long run. They would create assignments requiring the least amount of effort and time in order to get back to playing videogames or tanning on the beach. This defeats the purpose of the summer assignment because an easy project that does not challenge you will not continue your learning throughout the summer.

Additionally, this may be a great opportunity for teachers to help prepare students for the type of assignments they will be recieving the following school year. Students are unaware of what to expect, so they cannot prepare themselves adequately. Teachers have also been with these same students all year and know what they are good at, and what they need to work on. Assigning them a summer project may help these students work on their weak points, and gives them plenty of time to improve before the next school year.

Some may argue that if students are not actively trying to challenge themselves, then they are only hurting themselves. However, many students likely are not sure what type of project would benefit them best, or are unaware of what they need to work on to improve. They also likely assume that they do not need to be challenged or believe that they are already prepared for the next school year.

Overall, students would benefit more from teacher-designed summer assignments. Teachers know what students need to be prepared for and where their weak spots are. Often times students are unaware of how to help themselves improve. This last assignment can lead students in the right direction and assure that they are fully prepared for the following school year.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
CE58704B8EB3,"Most schools require students to complete a summer project to make sure that students are still expanding their knowledge while school is closed. These summer projects are long, uninteresting, and tiring. Most students refuse to complete a summer project. Summer projects should be made into something that students would want to do and enjoy doing. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to be creative, students can pick an assignment that is best for their knowledge capability, and students become more intrigued with their assignment.

Typically when summer projects are assigned from a teacher, they're similar assignments. When summer projects are similar, they attend to make all students the same and strips away any originality. Students need to be able to show their individuality through their work. Research shows that when students choose their assignments, they exceed by forty-five percent more than a teacher-assigned assignment. Creativeness is something that should be essential to students because that it was forms them as a whole and makes them unique to themselves. Each summer project would allow students to express themselves in ways that a teacher-assigned summer project can't. Creativity is something that is with-in a person and something that should never be taken away from an individual.

Students come in variety, from ethnicity, gender, age, and most importantly in this case, teaching perforations. Students will learn a lot better if they were allowed to pick their own assignments because they could create a summer project that is perfect for their learning pace. For example, I observed that when I am completing an assignment that is not too fast or not too slow for me, I do better tremendously. Summer projects are so horrific already, at the very least students should be able to decide what is best for their learning capacity. Pacing would set students up for great improvement and succession.

Students will become more interested in their summer project. Most students will not complete or do well on something that they are not interested in. An article stated that, because students are so young, and their brain has not developed yet, their attention span is very short. Meaning that students will not focus on anything for a very long time, especially something that is boring and has no significance to them. Evidence also shows that each year the passing rate and or completion rate of summer projects never exceed or increase, the rates always decrease. Students will be intrigued with their work if its assigned by them. If teachers keep assigning summer projects then the passing rate of the summer projects will continue to decrease, students need to stay interested and the most important way to have that happen is to allow them to choose their own summer project assignment.

Summer projects need to cater to students to cause improvement. Students do not require much to be successful,teachers just have to have the ability to allow their students to be flexible with their work. It is important that teachers grasp knowledge of how important it is that a student remains creative,that a student can pace themselves,that students remain intrigued, and most importantly students become successful with their summer projects. Summer projects are a wonderful idea but being student-assigned is way better.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
A827D5DE2309,"When school ends, and summer break begins, some schools require students to complete summer projects. These projects are to make sure students continue their education outside of school. When teachers design the projects, students are more challenged with the work they are given. However, a student-designed project is a much better choice; Students are more likely to do the work designed by them, students will have less of a hard time, and students will feel less stressed rather than having to do a more challenging project.

A project designed by a teacher can be dreadful enough, let alone the fact that the project is over break. Student-designed projects are more likely to be completed due to the simple fact that the work would be more enjoyable for students. When a student gets work that they are able to enjoy, they will complete it. Most teachers do not give out work that a student could enjoy, they just give out boring work. Some students enjoy the work when there are more interactive activities within the project, and some students do not get much done when it is just the work itself.

When students enjoy the work, that means they are not having a hard time understanding and completing what needs to be done. Students feel good and more confident in the work they do when they understand what they are doing. If a student has a hard time comprehending what is being taught, they tend to become indecisive and would choose to not turn their work in. Student can be nervous at times, like when they want to ask for help. Most students just try to either figure out work themselves or just not do the work. Making the projects student-designed can help students be more confident when it is on work they do not have a hard time on. Students work better on work they are confident on, and on work they know they are capable in doing.

School can stress a lot of children out. Making them continue doing work can add on to their stress if it is something they feel incapable of doing. Giving students the choice of designing their project can give them the benefit of the doubt, because the project is still what the school wants but just at the rate of what the student can do. Stress should not be something a school wants their students to have.

Summer break is the time for students to enjoy themselves. Students should at least have the choice on how their project is designed. All year the teachers had a say on what their work would consist of. The students should have a project they could enjoy doing, and not feel forced to do a project they would have a hard time on. If they have to have a project it should be something they do not stress over, but something they are confident in doing.                              ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
F81D76345F2D,"Have you ever wondered, why students stress themselves up during their summer vacations? Why sometimes they refuse to interact with people around them? Well, the reason of this issue is the ""teacher-designed projects."" Projects are extremely beneficial and they can be in different forms like posters, presentations, models, videos, etc. Projects are very profitable, especially, in the long summer vacations because these introduces new ideas to students. Researching and building a project should both be interesting to students because then students will place their full effort, due to their enthusiasm. However, some schools require students to complete the teacher-designed projects. This means that students have to complete the teacher's-designed projects. What if the project is about the topic which students do not like to study about? Their lack of interest could lead them towards learning nothing about the specific topic. I believe, that schools must require students to complete summer projects of their own preference to assure they continue learning because it can help students in becoming more knowledgeable about the topic and can assist them in achieving their goals.

The primary reason that why students should be allowed to have their own-designed projects is that it helps them to become more knowledgeable about the particular topic. One example of the benefits of student-designed projects is that the topic which interests them more, they are willing to put their 100% effort in researching and understanding about the topic. For instance, a student have interests in researching about the bad effects of ultraviolet rays from the sun on people. The student who enjoys this topic would not only research about the bad effects of these rays on people, but also would be automatically encouraged to go more dense to its roots, such as, effects on aquatic wildlife, atmosphere, etc. Another example of the benefits of student-designed projects is that the students can teach others about what they have learned through their research. Not everyone is aware about the bad effects of ultraviolet rays. So, the student who is already acquainted with this topic can detail the adverse impacts of these rays to his/her youngsters and even elders. Then the society of ours will also be in less danger because if everyone is aware about the adverse effects of these rays, people will be more cautious and apply precautions to stay healthy. Based on this evidence, schools should require students to complete their own-designed project, as it helps them in becoming more knowledgeable.

Another reason of why schools should require students to complete summer projects of their own choice is that it is helpful in achieving their goals through the research about their interests. All the research that the project requires to have, might convey students to think and choose their particular career path. Teenagers often over think about their future jobs and overwhelm themselves. They might consider going into the field about which they are unaware of. This makes them change their minds swiftly, from one career to another. The shifting of minds affects students when they graduate from their schools, and are unclear about their careers. But, the students which have already researched about the jobs for their careers and have made projects on their interests, they become more successful in their lives. This is because, research made them more aware about the positives and negatives of the specific careers. Another example of the benefit of the student-designed project is that the students who already researched their fields for their careers, will have the potential to make their wishes come true. Successful career paths always provide the good amount of salary. Students can use their this capital to buy houses, cars, etc. Based on these proofs, the students through their own designed projects, can choose a career path that suits them well and can fulfill their dreams.

While the above specific examples shows that the schools should require the students to design their own preferred summer projects, one can argue otherwise. Some people might argue that the teachers are more knowledgeable about what the students should be learning about. That without the teacher's directions, the students will get off task. But, what if the teacher assigns the project about Mahatma Gandhi's struggles in his life? Students even if they lack interest in this topic, have to complete the project anyway. Lacking interests in a specific topic also lead students to a stage where they cannot contribute their 100% to their projects because this is what they don't have their interests in. Therefore, from their little amount of effort, they will not be able to obtain good amount of scores. Whereas, if the teachers themselves asks students to complete their own designed projects, students will never hesitate to provide their 100% effort to the project. This is so because, this would be about something they want to study more and research on. The more effort students put into their projects, the more better they score.

In conclusion, I believe that the schools should require the summer projects to be student-designed and not to be teacher-designed because this helps the students to obtain more knowledge about the topic they enjoy.

Student-designed projects captivates more attention of the students to research deeper and deeper. This eventually helps the students to get to know about that topic from its roots. The idea of Student-designed projects also assists students to achieve their goals, which eventually make them successful in their lives. Through much research, a certain field might get more interesting to a student than before. They might end up choosing that career. That is why, I believe that the schools should require students to design their own-designed projects. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0

If a student designes a project they are going to make sure it interests them. They aren't going to make it something they dont want to do. Some might say the students aren't going to know what information to learn and use in the project. If teachers work with students they can figure out a way to make sure that they students learn all the information they need to. Teachers can even give them a rubric with all the information the students need to use.

When you are doing something that you enjoy you stress about it less. Especially when you're on summer vacation doing a summer project is the last thing that you want to be doing. Kids would much rather hang out with friends or play video games. If students are designing the projects they will design something that is less time consuming or more easy to manage . While some agree with this others are concered that students would make the project too easy. Teachers at the end of the day are assigning the project, they can put guidelines and expectations on top of the students project design.

During summer vacation lots of students will travel and go places with family. Students can figure out a way to involve family members making the project easier to do on the road. Having a parent help out on a project helps out and helps kids stress less. While doing a project with family members might distract students from learning some say doing a project with parents might help kids focus as well. No kid wants to mess around during a project with their parents.

In conclusion, there are many benefits to allowing the students to design their own project. If students were to be allowed to design their own summer projects it would help students focus more on the project, it wouldn't be a super stressful project and students could involve their family. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
E2424E02CF26,"Do you think summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed? In my opinion, summer project should be student-designed. For students, summer is a break from school; students should have the freedom to do a project based on what they want. Reasons why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students the ability to be creative, they feel less pressured, and it gives them responsibility.

First reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students the ability to be creative. If students come up with what their projects is based on, it shows their creativeness. They can describe and show their personality through their project. They can also show their character and more about who they are. This can be a opportunity for students to open up with their teacher and classmates. Students can come out their comfort zone and be unique when creating their project.

Second reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because students feel less pressured. If students have a certain project, they feel more pressured to do exactly what the project is based on. The project may be based on a subject they may not feel comfortable with. If students have a student-designed project, they will avoid that conflict because they will be able to choose their own topic. This may also pressure students because they could get a project that doesn't appeal to their personality.

Third reason why I believe summer projects should be student-designed is because it gives students responsibility. Students will have all summer to create their project; if the project is not done, it shows they aren't responsible. The project shows if they can be able to do a project before the new school year begins. Certain students will prove they're able to complete a project throughout the summer. While others will prove they aren't responsible enough to complete a project. In addition, this will give them a task to do while they aren't in school.

In conclusion, I believe that summer projects should be student-based. My reasons on why I believe this should be a student-designed project is because it gives students the ability to be creative, they feel less pressured, and it gives them responsibility. A summer project should be a project you are comfortable with and can show how you unique every individual is. The project will also keep students feeling educated while not being in school.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

School summer projects have the capability to prepare students for a class and help students succeed. Schools that require students to complete summer projects should make the projects student-designed because they will help students learn the material, students will perform better in the class, and students will retain the material for a longer time.

School summer projects should be student-designed because they will help students learn. If school projects are student-designed students will learn the required information for the class easier. Furthermore, this allows them to understand the material in greater depth, rather than if the projects were teacher-designed. Teachers should already understand the information for the class. This means, that if projects were teacher-designed it would not help the teachers anymore, because they are not the people completing the projects, and students will not benefit as much because the projects are not geared towards them.

School summer projects should be student-designed because they will help students perform better in the class. To get good grades in the class, students answer questions based on their unit of learning. Therefore, if students understand the material they will perform better on the tests. Student-designed projects help the students understand the material, so students will perform better on tests. Also, students who do better on the tests will enjoy the class more than students who do not do well on the tests. Students will also be happier with themselves if they have a good grade in the class.

School summer projects should be student-designed because they will help students retain the material for a longer time. Summer projects that are student-designed will not only help students understand the material for one test, but they will remember the material for the length of the course and possible even longer. Student-designed summer projects will help students retain the material for the rest of the course and any future courses that are related to the first course they took. This could also affect the workplace. Students who are taking a course related to their current job or a job that they are looking for in the future will have the material retained that will help them. This means that they have the ability to do well in their job, and they will make a good living for themselves and their family.

Student-designed summer projects help students, the people who need it, to learn the material, rather than teachers, who should already know the material. Because students understand the material, they will perform better on tests and will be enjoy the class more and be happier with themselves. Also, students will retain the material for a longer period of time. That will make it easier for students in the rest of the course, and related courses they might take in the future, and current and future employment.

C1DA9C882822,"Schools give many projects and homework assignments to assure the student knows the information, and it also gives them a chance to learn something new. Schools give projects during spring break, winter break, and even our longest break during the summer. Many of these projects are made or designed by a teacher, while some have a basic outline and are mostly designed by the students. Projects should be designed mostly by the students, and many agree with this statement as well.

Summer break projects should be mostly designed by the student because this makes the students strengths and weaknesses easier to indicate. This allows the teacher to understand what his/her students need help with. They can guide the student on how to perfect their strengths and improve on their weaknesses. An example of this would be if a student is bad at giving examples in essays. If the student is given an essay on ""What was the most impactful battle of WWII"" , they have many examples to choose from and many reasons those examples would be chosen. But if the student is given an essay on ""Why should video cameras be used"" , their mediocre examples will be easier to notice as not as many facts back up the opinions on if cameras should be used or not. Some may say since student-designed essays show the students flaws, their flaws could cause them to get a poor grade. While this is true in some cases, it is better the student's teacher see his/her mistakes now and help them improve on them, rather than before the big test. Although this is indeed one, there are many more examples of why summer projects should be student-designed.

Summer break projects should be mostly designed by the student because this allows more creative freedom and ideas on the essay/project. A student has free range to think of new ideas if they are not put on a metaphorical leash by the teacher. They can explore new ideas which in turn could make their essay much better and even teach the teacher something they never knew before. A satisfactory example of this would be if the teacher assigned an essay where the student could write about whatever they want, but they had to relate it to racism. The student could write about slavery, the Civil Rights Movement, Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, and they could even write about hip hop. But if the teacher tells the student to write an essay about "" Why we read books"" or "" Why we eat food"" the students will all have similar responses. They will say something along the lines of "" We read books for the knowledge and information they give us"" or "" We eat food because food is a necessity our body needs to function properly"". These essays/projects are very linear and do not bring anything creative to the table. A few may say that allowing full creative freedom on essays will cause students to drift away from the central idea of the essay and dive into personal opinion. Of course it is inevitable this will happen to some, good writers will know to not do this and will stay on the topic of their essay, while the writers who went astray will get some help from their teachers on how to improve that.

Summer break projects should be mostly designed by students because this will encourage the student to do better on their essays/projects. Allowing freedom on a project allows the students to try as hard as they possibly can, while if they were given a project on something that disinterests them, they will only do what is required. If a student that is a fan of Lil Uzi Vert(rapper) is given a project on "" The Evolution of Classical Music"" , they are only going to do the minimum requirements of that project, while if they are given a project on Effect of Old Rap on New Hip Hop"" , they will be more interested as it relates to something they hold dear. Some people may say that the students should already be encouraged to do the project since it is an important grade at the beginning of your school year, which is true, but some students need to be motivated in order to want to go the extra mile, and doing a project on one of your favorite artists is the right motivation.

Summer break projects seem to have a negative vibe around them. Not many want to do them, and some think we shouldn't have them, but if we are going to have to do a project over the summer it should be about something e like or something we hold dear. Our families, our friends, our hobbies, our music taste, etc. Doing summer break projects on things that relates to us encourages us to do better, shows our flaws, and gives us freedom to run wild. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
9BDE16784EF6,"Usually when school is out for summer break, you instantly forget about everything that you have learned. Nowadays, schools want you to do some of project or activity to assure that you have more knowledge and learning throughout the break. If these projects are really going to happen, they should be teacher-designed. If these projects are designed by teachers, then they are most likely going to be more educational, you can get hands-on help from a teacher, and overall they can allow you to become more prepared for the upcoming school year.

Firstly, these summer projects should be teacher-designed because they can be more educational for the students. By doing this, you can learn many things that you never knew before. Such as ; a certain word problem, how to do an equation, or many other things as well. When the summer projects are finally over, you will be able to look back and see what all new information you have learned.

Secondly, you can get better hands-on help from the teacher. Say one of the projects is about something you have never seen or learned before. Obviously you are going to need to get help or a teacher's assistance. Instead of having to solve the problem by yourself, you can get someone's help so you can figure out what to do and how to do it.

Thirdly, overall a project designed by a teacher will allow yourself to be be more prepared for the up and coming school year. If you have a project based on one of the classes you are going to take next year, you can start preparing based on that. You can start learning what the class is all about too. At the end of the day, no matter what type of activity or project it is, it will prepare you for the next school year.

In conclusion, it is better for summer projects assigned by the school to be teacher-designed. In the end, they are way more educational than a project designed by a student them self. If you are not understanding something,or if it is difficult to complete, the teacher can help you out. Also in the long run, it will prepare and better yourself for the next school year.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
302A70590A53,"Summer break, most students favorite time of the year, the time of long hot summer days by the pool or even at the beach. This break given is a moderate period of time given to students and teachers throughout the hottest months of the year. Many children spend this time with their friends and family, some even take the opportunity to get a summer job. However some schools feel it is necessary to give their students an excessive amount of school work to do complete the summer. Many of these summer assignments are from classes including Math, English, and even some AP classes. Most summer assignments given do not provide an explanation of how to complete it, which leaves many students clueless and with no desire to complete their task. Students should be provide to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a drive to complete the work.

Summer break is supposed to be enjoyable days away from school with no stress. Giving these students school work over their times off is not fair to them nor is it fair to the teachers. When this work is given, large amounts of students choose not to complete it; or they chose to complete it but not with the best of their abilities. Most summer assignments that are given are not beneficial to the student when they return to school. In fact, many teachers do not discuss the summer assignment with the students and some have even chose to not put in the grade because many of their students did not complete it, which is not fair to the students that took the time out of their summer to complete it. With summer assignments being mandatory, students should be able to choose their assignments based on the classes they will be taking, in order to make their summer a little more enjoyable. No student wants to complete an assignment they have no interest in.

Almost all teachers a faculty spend their summer days off relaxing with their families and enjoying their time off, as they should. However they do not grade nor complete assignments for the students. Yes toward the end of the summer teachers have to go back to school earlier than their students to ensure their rooms are set up, cleaned, and ready for the children to return. School faculty also have to attend a few meetings together to make sure the upcoming school year will go smoothly. If students apply their summer time to the assignments the teachers should also apply their time to explaining the assignments throughly before their vaction.

A class that students need to have in order to continue learning over the summer, is math. Math is a subject that people use everyday. The assignments math teachers give should provide helpful ways for the student to learn and complete the assignment if it is something they may not know how to do. Most students do complete their summer assignments before summer break, which means they can ask for help from teachers around them. However some wait until they have down time to complete these assignments which causes them to forget how to complete it. All assignments that are given should give the student a clear understanding of how the teacher may want it to be completed, with an example to help assist the student for when the teacher is not around.

If the summer assignment that is assigned does not benefit the student and will not be brought up or discussed after they turn it in, it should not be given for them to complete on their days off. The assignments teachers assign are usually not enjoyable and take large periods of time to complete. If assignments must be given over the summer, students should have a choice from a variety of assignments to choose from; such as a power point on somewhere historical they could have visited over the summer or even reading a chosen book the class will read together during the upcoming school year

Students should not have to take time out of their days off the complete an assignment that will not help them in the up coming school year. Many students find summer assignments boting and unenjoyable, which is why they choose to not complete them. This is why students should be able to pick an assignment that appeals most to them, in order to give them a desire to do the work.   ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
A42187554C6A,"Teachers design the worst summer projects ,in some schools it is required that students should complete a summer project to make sure that they are still learning something during their break ,but some schools give out summer projects that the teacher design. Most students would agree that student designed projects would very much benefit them. In ways such as they can actually know what topic or subject they are doing,it can show one students creativity abilities,and the students may be really be interested in the project that they are doing.

First,when teachers assign a summer project it might be something that the student may not know or can not get a grasp of because it is too difficult for them to understand. And in some cases if it is too difficult for them the chances of them just giving up and not trying are pretty high. That is why if they pick their topic or subject for their project it may lead to a better outcome. Then you will see a lot more from that one students project.

Second,summer projects are for people with creative minds and want to do so much to their project and make it look nice,but they would have to be limited mainly because it has to go by what the teacher assign. But if that is the case then if the teacher did not choose the project then the creativity would go through the roof due to the many of creative minds of students and they would be limitless. And the outcome of the summer project would look stunning.

Finally,when given the project from the teacher it may come to a surprise that some students may not be interested into that one subject or topic that they are learning,so they would lose interest in the whole project and not put effort into it. But if it is for a topic or subject that they are interested in and that they can choose the teacher would fully capture their interest and the student may put effort into the project. And if they know so much about that one thing then you are sure going to see a lot of things down on that project.

One can argue that this is not a good idea for students on choosing their project one reason one could say is that it may lack focus ,that this curtain thing wont help them in life, and that they need to know more important things in school so that is why teachers would assign these projects for the teacher to know the understandings of their students.

So in conclusion, student designed projects would very much benefit them. In ways that they can actually know what topic or subject they are doing,it can show one students creativity,and the students may be really interested in the project that they are doing. And this can help them do more well in school due to that one summer project.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4

Summer break is a students favorite time of year. It is a vacation from school, five days a week, for three months. The only exception to this is a summer project. Teachers assign summer projects to their upcoming classes, so when school starts again they have not forgotten everything they previously learned and are prepared for what the new school year has in store. Although some people can argue that students should be given options for their summer assignments, it is best to leave that job to the professionals because they are the ones trying to refresh, prepare, and teach students. Even if the teacher does pick the topic, that does not mean students cannot be creative and think outside the box.

If students got to pick their own topics, maybe they would feel inspired and put in more effort, but it is more likely that they would do something easy they already know about. The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. For example, if your teacher asked you to read any book and write a report on it, it would be easy to pick a book you have already read or even Google a summary of a random book, but if your teacher picked the book, then you would read a book you probably have not read and actually learn something new. Copying down what you find online or using a book you read two years ago will not help you grow academically or refresh your mind.

The whole point of a summer project is to keep their brain refreshed over the summer. Since teachers already know the curriculum, before the year even starts, a simple summer project is perfect to keep their brain active while familiarizing them with new material. Even just writing a short poem inspired by the Romanticism Era with an analysis is a good way to introduce a subject they might not know a lot about. Summer projects do not have to be hard or long, just enough to give a preview of what they will be learning. A specific topic also allows a more detailed rubric because it tells you exactly what to do, whereas if everyone picked, the rubric would not be specific or very helpful.

Teachers can pick the topic of a summer assignment without taking the individuality out. If the teacher picks a topic, it is obviously something they know about already. Teachers picking the assignment also reduces confusion and encourages student collaboration to talk to each other about the task to better understand. Any project you get regardless of it being during the summer or the school is meant to prepare you for the future. High school is all about preparing you, whether that is something as small as starting a new school year to going to college.

Every single thing you do in life can teach you something. That is why teachers are so important because they get paid to teach students, like me. Even if it seems pointless, it is important to still do it because in the end, just completing the task shows perseverance and teaches students not to procrastinate. Nobody would hand out projects for fun. All assignments are to benefit their students in the long run. It is also important to try to have fun while doing school work because if your mind is open to new things, you might like what you are learning. Getting assigned a topic is not meant to put you in a box, it is meant to give a topic to explore.

We should leave the teaching to the teachers. Let them decide the best way to teach us because that is what they are here for. If they want us to really understand their lessons, they should pick the assignments to ensure they get the results they desire. Teachers went to school to learn the best methods of teaching, so we should trust them to refresh, prepare, and teach students everything they need to know.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
96B863B0B999,"Summer is a time for student to have a long deserved break from school. During this time, however, some students become unable to no longer retain their knowledge and have to recover prior knowledge starting the next school year. To compensate, some schools assign summer projects for the students to be proactively accomplishing. Whether it be a project that they get to design or a teacher designs for them. The main argument here is ""what is better"" for the learning experience of the student. A project created and designed by a student over the summer is better than a teacher designed one because the project will be more engaging for the student, the student will have full control, and the student will have easier time learning or their own accord.

A student who designs their own summer project will have a engaging experience with their project. As a student, the ability for a project to be fun to do and still be a good learning experience is number one. Having your own project to do gives you the sense that you know what you're capable of accomplishing. It will be engaging because student will get to interact in their own methods and ways. Learning in this way helps students to retain information and maybe learn about something they may have never thought about. An engaging project made by the students will also give the students a means of commitment to do the project if it is fun to do and is beneficial for them academically. Engagement in a project is the best way for a students to want to be able to drive their passion in learning forward, without the hassle of abiding by the teacher's rules and regulation of the project. Giving students the right to build their own project makes the learning part fun and engaging for the students, which will overall provide them with possibly of better academic achievement and retention.

Students with full control their project will be able to make it a project they will be proud of. Full control means that students will be able to go though the steps of conception, planning/design, making/prototyping, and possibly revision on their own. Giving students the leveraging control, builds the sense that they understand the topic the most and that they should be able to complete the project under their own goals and ideas. This helps to build skills in learning and retaining information taught. With full control, they will also have the necessary time to complete their project on their own without the overlooking burden of a teacher telling them what to do exactly. This removes the unnecessary stress of designing a project to meet someone else's goals and hoping that it will meet their specifications. A student, given this freedom of choice and design, will be able to learn more about something that they enjoy learning about, it makes the overall experience better for them and also builds their design processes to be better efficient and less costly to them. These skills learned from being in full control of a major project can be used in schools and possibly be used later in the workplace or any other setting that puts them under control of a project.

The last argument is that students will have an easier time of learning when they get to make it. Without the teacher being in the way, not only will the student be hopefully, less stressed, but also put them in charge of learning. Being able to self pace yourself, will help to slowly build up information into your mind and retain that information for longer when you may have to use it one day in the near future. Without the regulations of an authoritative teacher, students build projects under their ideas. As long as the project is providing the student with educational content that they will learn from, they will be able to enjoy it, which removes the boring parts of learning about a certain subject and instead, make it fun to learn about and understand. Students building up the knowledge slowly by themselves, will slowly integrate the information into their mind slowly, without overwhelming students with complex research projects or projects dealing with hard to reach goals assigned by the teacher. A student who learns by themselves may be smarter and less worried by the goals of a project than a student who has to follow the rules and regulations word for word from the teacher. Students that get to design the projects themselves will overall have an easier time understanding and learning.

A couple of main arguments that may arise when students get to make their own summer projects is that they may not be learning about what they should be learning about or the project is not regulated enough itself to provide any academic goals. Or, a student may make a project that is overall not fitted for any academic setting. For the most part, if students are just given maybe one or two rules stating that it must be a project that someone can actually obtain information from and that the project is not just a simple little project. Then the need for a teacher to design a project for the students is effectively gone, since they would only have to follow the simple rule of not making it too easy on themselves and make a project that will help them excel academically.

To wrap up, projects under the design of a student will be better than a teacher designed one because the students are better engaged in their own projects, the students will have full control of their project and everything that goes into it, and the students will have an easier time comprehending/learning at their own pace. Schools that assign summer projects know that the real intent is to help keep the students proactive in their studies over the summer break, and these projects are suppose to help them do so. Student designed projects will be a better option for schools since it gives the students choice in their education. And that profound statement, gives students a better chance at starting off the next school year with information ready to be used. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
2017D32A0639,"Many schools across the country require students to complete summer assignments to assure that they continue their pursuit of knowledge even without a teacher present. But should these assignments be designed by the teacher or should they be designed by the student? If a student were given freedom with their project, it would be a lot more enjoyable rather than if a teacher put strict conditions on it. But a lack of strictness would mean that students are less likely to complete their project and they wouldn't know when the work they have done is enough. Teachers should put that restriction on the student and give them a specific assignment to ensure that the appropriate amount of work gets done.

Students are less likely to complete a project that they have freedom on and if they do complete it, the quality would suffer greatly compared to if a teacher gave them a prompt or a specific task to accomplish. The point of a summer assignment is to prevent to student from losing knowledge or getting rusty because of a break. Although the point of the summer break is to let students relax until the next year starts, it's still important that they keep their studies up. Assignments shouldn' be student-designed because that would allow too much leisure and when school comes around, most students would not have it done. For example, I had two summer assignments last summer. One was for English and one was for Math. For the English one, the assignment was to read any book of my choosing and write a review about it. This assignment had very unclear instructions and I, the student, was supposed to add my own twist to it and complete the assignment however I wanted to. I started on the assignment, but never finished it because I didn't have the motive since there was no specific prompt to answer to, so I wrote a couple of sentences and called it quits. But for the Math assignment, I had a packet to complete of practice problems. The finish was in sight and crystal clear. I did it throughout the summer and finished it by August. The reassurance I felt that once I did a specific amount of work and followed the teacher's directions, I would be done is what encouraged me to finish. The English assignment was unclear and I didn't know how much to complete to make sure that I was on track for next year.

Summer assignments are important for a student and the reason to have them teacher-designed is to give the student reassurance and to make sure the student doesn't do too much work over what's supposed to be a break, yet it keeps them on track. If an assignment is student-designed then the student will do one of three things: overwork themselves, not fully apply their capabilities, or not do the work at all. For these reasons, summer assignments should all be teacher-designed.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
FB96DB942F3B,"Imagine you just finished your sophomore year of high school. Summer has finally arrived! The whole Summer is yours for you to do anything and everything you want to do... except for your Summer assignment. In one class, your teacher has assigned you to run a specific research project that encompasses all the main ideas of the subject. In another class, the teacher has given you the assignment of designing and completing your own project. You sit down and think. Which one of these projects will teach me the subject better? Summer project assignments should be designed by the teacher of the course's project since it would avoid students designing projects that are not challenging enough, teachers know the subject better, and they are trained to give the right assignments for effective teaching.

First and foremost, high school students are known to avoid the heavier workload if given the choice of a lighter one, even if the heavier workload will benefit them in the long run. For example, I've had the experience of having a history class assign more work one year, and the next year's history class assign less. In the class with more projects and work given, I learned the material more thoroughly and can still apply the material I learned to other situations. On the other hand, I can't remember much of the material from the class that gave me less work and projects. Though I enjoyed the lighter class, I learned that more work is equivalent to a better understanding of the subject. This, therefore, means that students, with their preference for less work, would not benefit from designing their own project since they'd simply design a light and extremely easy project.

Another reason why teachers should design Summer projects is that they know the subject they teach better than the students they are assigning the project to. Teachers, apart from having learned and gone through the same classes as the students they teach, have also gone to college and studied the subject in a lot more depth for years. They simply know more than the student and know what projects helped them, as students, learn the material. A chemistry teacher, for example, is going to know what project to give to students in order for the student to learn chemistry since the students haven't even taken the class yet. Students do not know what projects will teach them effectively.

Additionally, teachers have gone through years of schooling and college to get to the position they are in, as well as probably having years of teaching experience. They have been trained to teach students effectively and know what methods of teaching work best. This also means that teachers know which projects and what approach to projects are best for students. In my science class one year I had the option of designing and running my own experiment. I chose the easiest option and ended up doing badly since there were no instructions or guidelines for the experiment. I did learn from my mistakes and having to teach myself the subjects related to the experiment, but the experiment was mostly a fiasco. I learned the subjects a lot better when my teacher gave us a project that had clear intentions and guidelines that guided us to the main lesson we were being taught rather than just a project of doing whatever thrown at us. Teacher usually knows best.

After a few moments of thinking, you come to the conclusion that teacher-designed projects teach you better and more effectively. Yes, you as a student do know how you yourself learn better than a teacher knows how you specifically learn. Yes, students can also learn from the process and mistakes of designing a project, but the truth is that the likelihood of at least the majority of students putting the effort into their project to put these ideas into account is very low. Teachers know how to teach and what projects to give to students to effectively teach. Now, you sit down and start your projects.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
22C9D0A8F789,"Summer projects, although tidious and time consuming, are important. They are given to students by teachers to allow the students to retain the knowlege they have previously learned. They might also be given to teach the students new concepts before they enter the new school year. This allows teachers to teach a new concept at a faster pace since the students already taught it to themselves over the break. These project are very common in higher level classes because they require a higher level of understanding. These projects should be student-designed. I think that student-designed projects are a more efficient way for students to learn the required material over the summer break. It gives the students the flexibility that teacher-designed projects don't give. This is because students can design the project to their specific learning style and schedule and it allows the students to explore their creative side.

If students design their own projects they have the ability to cater to their own learning needs. Some students are visual learners. Some benefit from repitition. Each student is vastly different from next. For example, if someone knew that they were a visual learner, they could draw pictures about the topic that they are learning about. They could illustrate a storyboard about a major war or make a cartoon about how to solve a math problem. They would not benefit from making flashcards and memorizing words because their brain deems those tactics boring. When someone's brain recognizes something as fun and enjoyable, it is more awake and ready to work. This also allows the students who don't know the best way that their brain retains information to explore and find what works best for them. This could help students in the long run by making them aware of what tactics they can use to study for tests.

Students, especially high school and college level ones, usually have extremely full schedules. On the days they don't have extracurricular activities, they have work or home responsibilities. The range of what keeps a student busy is enormous. From a part-time job to band practice, students are overwhelmed with endless responsibilies. Allowing students to design their own summer projects gives them the ability to set their own work load. This takes some of the pressure off and still gives them the time to focus on other things in their lives. If a student only has two hours in their day to do school work, they won't design a project that requires them to research a topic for three hours a day and then write about it for two more hours. They will make something that allows them to research a quick topic and write a short paragraph so they can get in their eight hours of sleep.

Schools focus on challenging their students academically and they champion the students who thrive in the athletic department. Schools usually fail to give any attention to the students who excel in being creative and having problem solving skills. Student-designed school projects would allow those students to thrive in making up a unique and efficient way to learn a new concept. It would also be beneficial to the students who struggle in that area, allowing them to practice and explore new ideas. As a student who stuggles in being original and creative, I would be forced to research new ways of learning. It would make me practice thinking outside of the box which is an important skill that can be applied outside of a school setting and in the workplace.

Although student-designed projects allow students to make projects to their specific learning style and schedule and allows the students to explore their creative side, there are also things that teacher-designed projects are more efficient at. Teacher-designed projects make sure that what is needed to be learned, is actually learned. If a student designs their own project based on a broad topic, they may miss key terms or ideas that are essential to understanding the whole topic. When a project is guided by the teacher's instructions, students are less likely to be confused. There is also the chance that a student designs a project so they do not have to do any work. They can make one that requires them to only write their name on a piece of paper. Most projects are already teacher-designed and not many people have trouble understanding them. If students were to start designing their own projects it may leave students confused and unprepared for their class when the school year starts.

I think that teacher-designed projects can be beneficial, but not to every student. Allowing the students to make their own projects makes certain that every student will learn the material in their own style and at their own pace. When teachers design projects, many students don't understand and are left behind. Even though some students may design a project that is incredibly simple, not all students want self-sabatoge like that. Most students understand that summer work can set them up for success during the school year. I think that the pros outweigh the cons on allowing students to design their own summer projects. Student-designed projects allow students to learn by their own style, learn at their own pace, and explore and implement their creative ideas. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
A85730F12092,"For most, summer is filled with unwinding from the stresses of school, traveling to new places, and learning new skills. This break is given to students to relax and reflect on all of their hard work. Summer allows students to find activities that they are passionate about. Summer assignments should be student-designed because this allows students to determine the extent and length, the topic, and the platform the project will take place on. This break in between moving onto the next level of education is meant for students to distress and enjoy life outside of school. Surely, making the summer projects more student-based allows for scholars to continue to learn, while also allowing students to enjoy time off.

An important part of growing as a person and figuring out what career path to go down in the future is exploring possible interests. This break from the school year allows for students to do this outside of school, as well as time given to relax. If the length of the projects assigned over the summer are chosen by teachers, the students could end up with a big work load which takes away from their opportunities. Many students get jobs over the summer to gain work experience before furthering their education after high school. Not only does this help them build their transcript and resume before moving onto a new chapter in life, but it also allows them to figure out what they like do versus what they do not like to do. Students who are overwhelmed with summer projects are more inclined to not get a job or participate in the things they like to do, which defeats the purpose of the break.

Another positive outcome of student-designed projects is students can have a say in what they want to research. If the students are allowed to pick the topic of their projects that have to do with the associated class, they are more likely to have better work and learn more. Again, this break is given to scholars to allow them to enjoy life outside of school. By giving students no say in the topic they are furthering their learning on, they are less inclined to do their best work or even any work at all. Having students pick the topic of their summer assignments would surely make the projects more enjoyable and easier for the students to complete.

Finally, the last component that students should be able to determine for their summer projects is the platform they use to complete the project. Hands-on students prefer to do projects on a poster board, while more tech-savvy students would prefer to use Google slides or Prezi to present their work. Giving students a say in the way they are able to complete their project makes it a lot more enjoyable for them, essentially making it easier to complete. There are many different types of learners like people who prefer to visualize the topic they are learning about or people who would rather hear more on the topic. More visual learners may have better time comprehending the subject of the project if they can add visuals to the projects by hand. Audible learners may want to listen to videos regarding the topic and film a podcast discussing their work to better process the research they have done.

Student-designed projects allow for better learning and understanding of the topic, while still allowing students to enjoy their time off from school. Although, student should have a say in the subject, length, and platform of their summer projects, teachers should also set boundaries for these projects. It would be pointless for students to study a topic not relating to the class at all. Teachers could provide students with a list of subjects to research that they can pick from. There should also be guidelines that pertain to the length of the project because it is unfair if some students work really hard on the summer projects, yet others slack off for the same grade. However, the students should have some say in the amount of work they chose to do. Students should also be given multiple platforms to choose from, but not completely free range. The risk with giving students a free range of platforms is students could use platforms that teachers are not familiar with. Students should be given the choice of the topic, length, and platform concerning their summer assignments with teacher guidelines. It is important to keep students learning, while also letting them participate in the things they are passionate about.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
AB831D6AD78A,"Once a year Summer break comes around, the time of year every student is looking forwards too from the moment it end till the minute it begins. Yet some schools believe that their students need to continue to study, and learn over this long break. Summer is a time that has always been advertised as a time to go on vacation and put down all the books for a series of weeks to have fun. Yet for some students this isn't an option some teachers assign rigorous assignments for students to complete which can completely control and ruin their time off. By having students plan their own summer assignments, students can still excel and be ready for school when they return, and have that ideal Summer that isn't behind a book or keyboard.

Giving students the opportunity to create, and design their own Summer work opens endless opportunities and can actually inspire learning new things inside and outside of the standard curriculum. By having majority of students elect a certain amount of peers to create these assignments for them, which would give a students insight on how much work we should be given, and how flexible it should be. Teachers still will have to approve of the work created and revise if, and as needed to make sure it is adequate and follows the curriculum to prepare students. With all of this said and done, many arguments can arise about how elected students could give minimalist work because they feel pressured by friends and other peers to make it easy, which is all more reasons teachers should still oversee the process, and decide if it is fair or not.

If schools eventually decide to let students design, and assign their own Summer homework this could still come with much skepticism, being a new concept means it could come with some minor flaws to be discovered. Yet with the proper determination and open willingness to change both students and teachers can benefit and be ready for the new school year when they return with the newly founded knowledge they need to succeed in their new year, while having their ideal vacations and spending time with their family instead of being behind a book or keyboard.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
2C9C9A03C5C9,"During the summer, students across the world are given a break from school and the stress it entails. Although I believe summer break is an important thing for students, it can also be harmful educationally. This is because when students take extended breaks from their regular education, they often tend to forget things regarding their previous curriculum, and this break can also make it emotionally harder for students to return to school at the end of their summer break. Schools who require their students to complete summer projects have proved higher scores in student testing and graduation rates. I believe that these projects should be teacher-designed rather than student-designed. This is because teacher-designed summer projects would be more specific to curriculum, more educational, and more effective regarding preparation for the start of the school year, opposed to student-designed projects.

To begin, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be more specific to curriculum opposed to student-designed projects. This is because teachers have further knowlege of upcomming curriculum while students do not. Therefore, the teacher-designed projects would be more hlepful in preparing a student for his or her upcoming classes. For example, if a teacher were to design a history project for a rising senior taking government for their next history class, the project would likely be based on a summary or unit in the students upocoming class. This project would be a simple way of preparing this student for their upcoming class and the curriculum it involves. If the student had designed the project themself, it may be on the wrong materal or may not be focused on important information they'll need during their upcoming school year. Although it is important to gain a basis of all knowledge, the more specific infomation a teacher would be able to demonstrate would be far more effective and helpful for a student in the long run.

Secondly, I believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more educational than student-designed projects during the summer. This is because teachers have previously attended college and have earned degrees to professionally provide education to students. As experts in this field, a teacher would likely include more useful and informative information on a summer project, thus making the project far more effective. If a student were to design a project this could result in an activity that is not nearly as educational, helpful, and ultimately worth-while. If there are more educational benefits included in summer projects it can successfully provide an oppurtunity for students to learn and grow, while a student-designed project may lack this needed education which could result in a class being too challenging, stressful, and this student having an ultimately harder school life.

Lastly, I strongly believe that teacher-designed projects would be far more effective regarding preparation for the start of a students school year. Teachers are aware of the details included in certain classes, and they have knowlege of a lot more information about these courses than a student would. Although a student may effectively design a summer project based on previoulsy taken classes, I believe education can only be expanded through gaining more knowledge regarding future classes, and these projects would likely be more effective if they were focused more toward a student's upcoming schooling rather than their previous education. This would allow the student to be effectively prepared and ready for the new school year, and possibly more prepared for some challenging courses they may end up taking in thier future, whether that is in grade school or earning a more advance degree. Not only would the teacher-designed project prepare them further, but it could also effectively make their next school year less stressful and more comprehendable. The teacher-designed project would not only prepare them for future education, but it could also prepare them for real-world struggles. For example, if a teacher-designed project ends up being challenging and stressful for a student, it will act as many real-life struggles. If this student were able to put hard work into completing this project, not only will they be further prepared educationally, but it could have the ability of showing them that life has challenges that may seem difficult but are never impossible.

As time passes and problems are thrown at us, it seems as though young people are the one's with problem-solving ideas, and although I strongly stand by the idea of children and young people progressing our world, it is important that these students inquire the proper education to do so. That is why I believe that teacher-designed summer projects would be immensely more effective than student-designed projects during the summer. If students are able to complete these teacher-designed summer projects it could make their schooling more effective, thus producing future societal contributors. These teacher-designed projects could be a driving force in creating a problem solving adult who in the longrun could change the future of our fast-paced world and its many obstacles.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
2C6F27E9A710,"Almost everyone who attended school can attest to how boring and tedious summer work can be. Whether it's assigned reading or a project, students often dislike having schoolwork cut into their summertime. However, it is a necessary evil, and although there are compelling arguments for self-directed learning and independent study, the fact remains that it's the teacher's job to know how to help their students learn. Summer work should be designed via a partnership of students and teachers, so that students can learn in ways that interest them and help them grow, and teachers can ensure that the material is taught correctly.

While the intervention of teachers in this process may seem to be too controlling or unnecessary, the fact remains that they have gone through a lengthy process to ensure that they are trained to teach the material as effectively as possible. They go through an extensive process involving obtaining at least a bachelor's degree as an undergraduate student (and in many cases going even further and pursuing post-graduate studies), spending time as a student teacher, obtaining other certifications, and taking part in continuing teacher training throughout their careers. The experience and education that teachers have is simply too much to ignore when considering the development of a student's summer project or curriculum.

Another factor to consider when advocating for students developing their own projects or curriculum is that all students are different. Some may not design their own work with their own best educational interests in mind, and others may not do as well learning via a highly structured summer project or curriculum. Yes, some students are very bright or passionate and will diligently undertake projects and studies on their own, but that is not true for all students. Everyone learns differently, and many people thrive in situations where they have specific guidelines and rules to follow or goals to meet. The wide range of learning and personality types in schools is a major reason why summer projects and curricula should be a collaborative effort between students and teachers. No two students learn the same, so why should they be forced to do the same work?

Although there are many good reasons for students doing projects that were designed by a teacher, it is also important to consider the fact that teachers may simply be out of touch with how their students wish to learn. Student-designed work can be incredibly fulfilling upon completion; the student will have identified an area of study they enjoy, pursued and researched it, and hopefully will have reached a fulfilling conclusion through a project, experiment, or assignment. However, all of this can be accomplished to its fullest potential with the help of an adult. A trusted mentor (such as a teacher), can be an invaluable resource to a young person undertaking a major project on their own.

Much of education deals with absolutes. Standardized testing, graduation requirements, etc., etc. One can go on and on describing all of the things that individuals must do to conform with the school system. All of this is necessary to ensure that all students find success. However, summer work is a wonderful opportunity for a student's individuality to shine through, and with the help of a teacher, they can design work that will be fulfilling and extremely educational.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
FA1E56F220C0,"Should summer projects be teacher designed or student designed?

Student's should be able to design their own summer projects. Why? because it's their summer and if it's a boring project that a teacher assigned it's most likely not going to get done , because it don't catch the student interest if the student design their own project they created it's most likely to get done because it's something that he/she likes.

Teacher design might not be what the students are interested in , and they might not understand it. If the student creates their design it could be fun and easy for them, and they will be learning from it as well, and they will understand it more because they are make whatever out of it. They could do it in their own way which will also make them determine to complete their own design they created.

Students design could also help the teachers too , they wouldn't have to do much planning cause the students have to come up with their own designs so the students have to come out with ideas on their own. The students will be engaged because they have to focus on what they will come up with for their design for this summer project also the enjoyment they would get out for creating their own design project. The students will be learning it in their own way that's not boring to them. That way it will keep them motivated and interested while they are working on their project.

Student's should have a right to do something that would be entertaining to them since it's the summer and they have to work on it so they can continue to learn. If teachers design it , it might not engaged the student's as if they could design it their self. If students design their own project it will be easier for them to complete it while having fun creating it. The students will be determine to actually do their project during the summer because they designed it and liked it.

Most people would agree that students should be able to design their own project because its something that they would be interested in and it's a summer project, while they design the project they could be exploring the world, and they would come up with a lot of good designs for the project because they are learning a lot of new things each and everyday and that's why i think this statement is true that students should design their own summer project rather than a teacher design the student's project.        ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
256E7C7650C8,"Work over the summer sounds boring enough, it creates less time to have fun over the summer break. However, what if it was the students to design the summer project, that can be based on a interest, a hobby, or an activity. In addition, if this was a possibility, creativity can shine on a student project, and a sense of pride upon working, so while doing work, student can enjoy of what they enjoy, share their ideas and passion. While others believe, that teacher should designed the summer projects; However, if the summer project was a student design, it'll benefits students and gives freedom to work on what they are interested.

If were to be students designing a summer project for school, it brings out the creativity and how its unique from comparing other student's projects. Also, this summer project can spark a students passion or ideas to share, and create a voice for themselves. Moreover, student designed project, can cause less vulnerability of copying others projects, it creates a space where everyone is unique in their own way. I've done this project similar to the summer project, but mine wasn't in the summer, this was an annual thing where students share their ideas or passion in the criteria of being a creative and critical thinking, communication, etc. The project was a student based work, this benefited everyone to become unique and show your ideas to be a being collaborator, or communicator. Their were many different projects and many different voices spread across the school, it made me to feel that being different is great and striving for the passion is a key to owning success. I had fun doing this project, it gave me more freedom, it made me connect to more people who has same passion and ideas as I did. If the summer project was a student design project, it can help people spread their passion.

From the project, there was not a lot of commitment for sharing ideas. Procrastination happens a lot, student can pretend to work on it because they are afraid that it will take to long, or worked on it poorly just for a good grade. Also, how would the grading system work on the summer project, how can a teacher grade on a student of their ideas. Moreover, a teacher designed project would set standards of the project and can help students complete it, and it can be easy to know the rules of making the project. When I was preparing my project, I saw many student did their work but with low quality work, their wasn't a lot of encouragement to the students project. There should be requirements on the summer project, to make rules that are not strict, but can set and help students to regulate their project.

In conclusion, student designed project should be the main design, it helps student bring out their creative side and share ideas. Although, this can lead into lazy work, to no work at all, or no encouragement among students. Setting regulations and rules toward the project, can help to set up thier ideas or passion to share. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
0555B97EB61C,"When it's summer it basically means freedom for all kids. But there are some schools who do give their kids summer projects for them to do so they still lean during their break and they are all teacher designed. Students should be able to design their own projects because they can make time to work and pick their own deadlines, make their own instructions for them to understand, and how they learn by themselves.

Students should be able to make time for their projects and pick their own deadlines. When you are assigned a project at school; the teacher picks the time for you to be able to work on your project. But there are times were these picked times affect students other life. Some may already have plans to do something whether it's going on a trip or just hanging out with friends, and family. And it's sorta ruined because now they have to stress on finishing a project during their plans. And a thing to avoid students from getting is stress. During the school year kids already have enough stress to deal with because they are given a lot work to do and only have a certain amount of time to finish their assignments. Lets not have students stress during their long break which they deserve. By allowing them to pick their time to work, and picking their deadlines; it'll eliminate the stress, and they can have their fun without it getting ruined.

Teacher when they assign projects; they get to make the instructions on how to do the assignment. Sometimes the instructions are clear for some students, but for the others it isn't. Students are always told to ask their teachers if they have any questions or don't understand the assignment. But for some students, asking questions and trying to understand what to do still isn't clear for them, and they go ahead and try to figure it out themselves doing more work and once again giving them stress; only to find out they did it wrong. By allowing them to make their own instructions, it'll be clear for them to understand and they won't have to go through a lot of hard work to figure out what to do. Students already know what they need to know, and by making them do something they don't know at all, won't help them at all in the future. And they don't want to learn something they didn't know during the school year and now they have to learn it during there break.

A teachers goal is to teach their students as well as possible, and hope that what they taught their student; they continue to still use it in their future. Allowing students to make their own assignments can show what they have learned from their teachers. It can help the teachers show what they need to teach future students and it shows that they are doing a good job to students education. And it'll show how well they can work on their own with the knowledge they have acquired, and with their creative mind they can come up with amazing things.. Teachers want to see one of their students as a leader; and by giving them the chance to make their own projects, is giving the current leader hope that their student can carry the touch for others. And during the summer they can learn more on their own which is what the teachers want: and show huge improvements to their learning.

Students should be able to make their own assignments because they can make the time to do their work, can make their own instructions, and show what they have learned. Teachers ever year are teaching the new generation what they need to know and how to do it. They should let their students design their own assignments because it'll be a huge benefit for them, and as well a huge one to teachers. These students can come up with amazing projects that may lead to teachers using their projects to be assigned to other students. And to the teachers reading this, let us have a chance to do it. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
62E441E58EC2,"As summer break begins, students utilize the time as a break from school to complete and indulge themselves into numerous and fun activities. However, to ensure the active learning of students, some school assign projects that require work being done over the break. With that being said, the projects should be designed by students than teachers to ensure the creativity and originality of the projects assigned as well as, the development of the students coming into the new school year.

Student designed projects will allow students to be solely responsible for their learning and topics in which the project will be on. This will eventually display each individual's independence and ability to complete the project and will hopefully allow the student to accommodate skills such as time management and a sense independence in their work. As students work on their projects, they will able to complete them on their own time with their own ideas that interest them. With student designed projects, they will know how to follow their own instructions, rules and regulations concerning the project and determine their own continued learning outside of school during the break that will benefit them as individuals. Seeing that the students do well, this will further contribute to their qualities and assist in building them up as fit individuals of society. Also with the independence of being able to create their own assignment, teachers will become eager to see what the students have come up with and surprised with the work and skills the students will show through their projects in which they have accommodated. This will effectively allow teachers to be amazed with the learning abilities of the students and base their teachings around the completion of the projects in order to ensure the success of the students. Teachers will also be able to understand the students views and standpoints as well as, where they're coming from as far as knowledge goes. Schools will see the benefit of allowing the students to design their projects based off the maturity and work executed by the students through their summer projects.

As the students are gaining the knowledge needed in completing the projects, they can develop a sense of authenticity and creativity by designing themselves. Students can include their own unique and fun ways of development and learning into the projects to assist them completing it in the best way possible. By doing so, the students can enjoy learning, work and projects all at the same time. Furthermore, they can develop innovative thinking strategies while including their own interests in which allow them to formulate an excellent project. Student designed project over teacher designed projects also benefit the students more directly because it targets their own thinking and reasoning in which contribute to the creativity but mainly the authenticity aspect of it . Students will possibly utilize a topic that caters to their continued learning outside of school. This can help build up their character and personality by displaying it through the assigned projects in which they developed. Schools can then see the head space of their students and then allow them to have more control over their learning.

Hopefully with student developed and designed projects, students can display their own learning qualities and create excellent projects that display what the schools intend them to learn over the break. Also this can give teachers a bit of a surprise and a break as well by allowing the students to take control of how they want to learn. By the school and teachers doing so, they can grant the students with the leverage and ability to learn in their own individual and innovative ways.           ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
BCA9ED73877E,"There are some schools that require summer projects for the students. What if they were student-designed rather than teacher-designed? With student going into their summer break and also teachers the thought of school really doesn't come to mind. With the requirements of the projects of students during the summer maybe students can add their own spice to the mixture. My thoughts on the idea that the project should be student based is that they can have their own personality to their project, put their own time into it, and the teachers can get to know their students.

With the idea that the project should be student based they can add their own twist to the project. I have a friend who went around Europe with her family during the summer. During her time there she still had to do a project for one of her classes and wasn't getting back home till a week before school started back up again. So during her stay she went to the popular places in Europe and tried to make connections of those places for her project. She told me that she had a lot of fun doing that with her project and that it even made it fun for her when she would edit it because it reminded her of the fun times that she had over there. Even though during the trip she said she preferred that she didn't have to work on a project during the time that she was away from school. She still had fun during the process with the idea that she had control over how she wanted to design it.

There are many students that usually get summer jobs so they might not have all the time in the world to focus on a project. My brother was some one that loved to work and when summer came around he would work all the time. He was in art classes in his high school years so they had to get some art pieces during the summer. At times at work if things weren't busy he would just get a napkin and draw little sketches that might come to mind. With some of his days off he would look back at the little sketches that he made and see if anything thing that he drew would give him inspiration. That's how he would do his art project and it worked for him. He pulled out multiple beautiful artworks that to this day he is very proud of. At time he wouldn't do some of the artwork since he might of been very busy the day prier and might of been very tired. He still had pushed even harder when he did work on the project. My brother would work during the summer and with the spare time that he had he would more effort into the project with the time he had free.

Teachers can already get a basic idea on what kind of person that they might be getting in their coming up class. I'm good friends with my sophomore history teacher so we talk before school. She planned a project for the up coming sophomores to see what's their personality was and if they basic history. She told me that she can see many different personality in her class by just looking at their projects. Some student are very artistic or they know details about certain events that went on in history. You can see so much in a single project of a student that they make it into their own. Right out of the back she already knew how to approach and what they can do in the future so that the student get their education but also have their own talents shine through. Some students might not put so much effort into their projects so we might not get a heads start into their characteristics. It nice to at least to have a good understanding of the students before you actually meet them so they can have an amazing school year.

With the idea that students should be able to design their own summer project is something that should be talked about. In the past most of the assignments are teachers giving it to the students and expecting them to follow a rubric. Things can change with the student must come up with something that they are proud to show and make it their own. With something small can lead to bigger things like just a simple summer project. Students should be able to add their own personality into it, put their own time into it, and that teachers can get to know the students though their project.  ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
AE86D4E2867D,"It was the summer of 2017. I was sitting at my desk, staring at a packet titled ""Algebra 2/ Trigonometry Summer Assignment"". I had been staring at that packed for quite a while, debating whether or not I should put it off for another day. I mean, high school seemed pretty daunting enough and this packet only made it seem worse. A ton of questions were running through my head, the loudest of these screaming, ""Why do I have to do this packet?"" But, I buckled down and got my pencil, eraser, and calculator and began solving through the questions, one by one. Ironically, at the end, I realized how much of a help that summer assignment was. It not only refreshed my memory and knowledge on math, but it helped me prepare for the math class I was going to take freshmen year. Surprisingly enough, it was quite fun as well. All in all, looking back, I realized that learning and keeping your brain fresh over break is important. Summer assignments and summer projects designed by teachers are key for accomplishing this. However, an argument presented stated that these summer projects should be designed by students. Summer projects should be designed by teachers and not students because teachers can construct better stimulating projects, teachers can specifically tailor the project to the students' weak points, and can prevent students from designing their own unnecessary, irrational projects.

Teachers are more highly experienced than students in educating students which leads to better quality projects that stimulate a student's learning. Teachers are trained to educate students and help them achieve academic excellence. To do so, teachers use a variety of methods, one of them being, handing out summer projects. Because teachers do this on a much more frequent basis than students, the quality of a summer project is starkly better than that of a student. Not to mention, the time it would take a student versus a teacher to design a project. With the experience and maturity as a teacher, the easier and faster a teacher can come up with a quality summer project. It would be like the difference between a well-seasoned actor or actress versus a rookie delivering a message across the scene to the audience through their acting. Obviously, the well-seasoned, mature actor or actress will have more depth and quality in his or her acting. In the same way, because teachers are so experienced in this field, teachers would be able to construct in depth, stimulating summer projects while at the same time saving work, time, and errors.

Not only does experience as a teacher work in favor of designing the summer projects, but the relationship between the student and teacher helps the teacher to specifically tailor the project to a student's weak point. Knowing the student from the teacher's perspective involves knowing their weak spots and strong spots. This is exceedingly beneficial because if one class is particularly struggling with one topic, than the teacher can specifically tailor that project to help that class improve and learn more about that subject. Being a student, you do not hold a teacher's critical perspective or knowledge to judge and analyze in where you have your lows and highs. This may work as a blind spot in constructing a project that wouldn't pinpoint the topics you need to better improve on. Shortcomings from being a student play a significant role in why summer projects should be designed by teachers.

Allowing the teacher to design the summer projects also prevents the students from designing too easy, too hard, too weird, or too goofy projects. When you leave an important task, like letting the students make their own project, it can lead to some projects that are not geared toward learning and retaining information, but geared toward having fun or not meeting academic standards. As much as it is important to have fun doing this project, the entire purpose of a project is to learn. It may be argued the other way, in that letting students design their own summer projects should be allowed, since it allows for the students to be creative and go a little out of their box to construct a fun, creative, and learning project. However, taking this route contains too much room for the opportunity to go way out of the box. It allows for students to take advantage of this opportunity and miss out on the opportunity to truly give themselves a learning experience. Although it may encourage creativity, it is better to be safe in giving the students an uniform summer project that meets the expected standards, than to give students the opportunity to design one on their own that might exceed or not even meet the standards for learning.

Teacher-designed projects yield more better and concrete results than student-designed projects because of their professionalism, conciseness in one subject, and intention, which is why summer projects should always be designed by teachers. This way, education among the students can be uniformly preserved and kept fresh over breaks. Education should always be kept to a high standard in which this is accomplished through teachers, the founders and base of the education in America.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
B8BE5466E96B,"A friend once said to me that summer is a giant break for us students to relax and recover from the stress of school. Some schools do require summer based projects during the break to keep us learning though. Sometimes these projects are teacher based or even student based. Teachers however, should not be designing summer based projects. Summer based projects should be student designed because students are more likely to enjoy them, it gives the students a chance to take action, and it helps give teachers insight on what they could do better.

If students design the summer projects, they are more likely to enjoy and be more invested in them. One time in summer school, I was in a class where we were solving a mystery. The mystery however, was left open ended and did not really have an ending. I remember all my classmates being really upset. If students were involved in the creation of this activity, they could have made it have a more meaningful ending as to what students might have wanted.

Next, Summer based projects should be fun for the students. They should be able to enjoy them without having to stress too much over them. Students are going to likely be more interested in the project if they create it themselves. Students might feel limited otherwise as to what they can do if it were a PowerPoint for example. There was a time where I wanted to do a drawing for a summer project, but my idea was rejected. I did not have as much fun with my project than I would have with my drawing.

Last but not least, teachers could benefit and learn how to improve summer projects. Teachers often design he majority of what we do whether it be lessons, notes or even projects. Teachers could learn and observe how we may want to do the projects. My mom is a high school teacher and she often asks me for advice as to what might help students not just learn, but also have fun or not hate school even. Teachers could give out monthly surveys as a way to help them gain feedback. Summer projects could work in a similar fashion. Teachers should also give students more independence and time to work on large projects.

Maybe some students in the past could have enjoyed school or summer projects more if they were student based. In the future, students should take the initiative and design more summer projects. Students should do this so they can get the most out of their learning. There might be some adults who say that students are just going to take advantage of them designing the projects and be lazy with it. However, students should learn how to do this kind of project based planning. It will help them be more independent and creative. Students should design summer projects so they can more likely enjoy them, help give teachers advice as to what they could improve, and it can help students mature.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
9871CC9324B2,"Some Schools want students to complete projects during the summer. These projects should be Student-designed because it will make students want to do them,ensure that they actually learn and it will help with their future. It could also set them up for collage or what they plan on doing after Highschool. Here are a few reasons i think the students should get to decide what their project is on.

The first reason is, it will make them more interested. If students can pick their topic or even what they do they might actually want to complete it. A lot of times in School your projects may not be on something your interested in, which makes you not want to do it as much. If you can pick theres no way you wont be interested because you picked the topic. Also if they get to choose what they do as a project, for example community service, essay about someone or something, or doing an internship could be be great things for them to do but they will learn in a fun way.

The next reason is it might help them with a future job. If someone were to do a project on something there interested in as a career it might help them decide if they want to do that. It will also open up possible jobs they didnt even know about but know have a chance to learn about. This could be really good for kids unsure about their future. This could even land them a job before they leave high school which sets them up well for the future. It will set them up for collage also.

The last reason would be good grades. In schools kids dont always get good grades. Part of the reason this happens is because their not interested in the topic. It can be hard to study something you dont like and do well on it. If the students made the choice they could pick whatever they wanted and could really have a good time doing this project. If students decided on their own project the teachers could really get an understanding of how that students actually preforms, not how they do in class on something the dont like.

Allowing students to decide their project could really allow for them to show their true potential. This project will not only help kids be more interested in what thy are learning about it will also help with the future out of Highschool and maybe even their grades in school. In conclusion a Student decided project will benefit the kids the most.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
AF9AA93024A9,"Schools deciding to give projects over the summer, should allow their students to design their own unique project. Teachers providing the project will most likely cause frustration in students. This could stem from a subject that is boring or they they do not like. Also, students do not want to spend all summer doing school work, so this will give students a more enjoyable learning experience. Requiring students to create their summer projects will allow students to enjoy their assignment, help them learn more efficient, and increase student responsibility.

Letting students design their own summer project will give students a more enjoyable experience with their project. Most likely, students will choose a topic that they like. This motivates them to accomplish their project because they will want to learn more about their favorite food, theme park, or animal. If teachers were to pick students topics, then teachers would pick a plain boring subject. This would make students feel made to do it, which will decrease the chances of them finishing it. Also, doing a project on a hobby or favorite snack allows students to experiment with it to conclude valuable data. This gives students evidence to why they enjoy their hobby or favorite snack. Overall, allowing students to create their own project will create a better and more enjoyable atmosphere.

Also, schools giving their students the right to create their own summer assignment helps students learn more efficient. More importantly, students that struggle to learn or focus will find these projects easier. It will also help them learn more and remember the information on the project. Students coming up with their own ideas gets them more excited, because they are not being forced to do their project on a topic they know anything about. This excitement to learn more about a topic creates a more efficient working environment, which helps students complete assignments. Also, students given summer projects by teachers will decrease the value of the project. Most students will find shortcuts or acquire help from a another student, sibling, or parent. However, students picking their own project will push them to gather the data on their own.

In addition, allowing students to design their own summer project will increase responsibility. Most people have been given everything since they were born, whether that be food, a home, or as small as a homework assignment. Yet, this makes people dependent on people to do things for them. However, giving students the right to create and accomplish their own project establishes responsibility in their life. They have to come up with the topic, gather data, and be able to show it on a poster or power point, all while having to finish in a certain amount of time. Students grasping the importance of responsibility will only prepare them for college and a job. The people and students with it succeed more often, because they have good time management, do their job, and understand its importance.

Having students create their own project, benefits them abundantly. It creates a better learning enviorment, while establishing importances in their life. Teachers creating the project for the students is no different from the school year students just faced. However, giving students some responsibility to accomplish a simple summer project is more than just a grade.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

If students designed summer projects they would enjoy the assignment much more. The assignment would not be a huge burden, but an activity that will be enjoyable and possibly exciting. Summer break should not be bothered by a teacher that designs a lousy project. Students could tweak the project and have fun designing and assigning the project, the project could be an activity they look forward to. The project could be less of an obstacle for students and less stress worthy. Ultimately Student designed projects could be an amazing experience for both student and teacher.

Teachers may even overload students with work, students sometimes get thick packets and they do not want to do packet work during their vacation. Teachers may not think twice about what they assign, but most of the time the assignments are pretentious and bothersome. The projects should be designed so that it compliments the activities students do, such as assigning a project based on the sports they play.

Summer vacation could be more enjoyable if students design summer projects. Teachers should let students design projects and guide them and encourage them on what to do and what not to do. Ultimately summer projects designed by students could be the best and most enjoyable aspect of summer vacation.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
C7F89A199353,"Summer projects should be designed by teachers and not the students. First off, when a student is on summer break, they usually don't want to do any more work than they have to, and making students design their own projects would make them less likely to complete the project. Second, a teacher designing the projects would mean that the accuracy of the project would better help the students learn as well as make the students more likely to complete the project before school starts.

When a student has to design their own project, that gives the student more work than necessary for a summer assignment. If a student is given too much freedom with the project they are more likely to procrastinate and forget about the project. For example, a student has to design their own project over the summer, but they have no idea what they should do. The student would then decide that they would figure it out later and forget about the assignment. Another reason, is that a student could be going out of town for vacation, and they wouldn't have the time to design their own project while on vacation.

Another reason teachers should design summer projects, is so that students can have detailed guidelines for their projects and learn all necessary information over the summer. If students are left to make their own project, then they are most likely going to do the minimum amount of work and gain very little of what they could be learning. If a teacher designs the project, then they could include everything that the student needs to learn for the upcoming school year while still giving the studnents a reasonable amount of work over the summer. For example, a student on vacation wouldn't have time to design and complete their own project, but if there are clear guidelines for the project, the student could complete the project around their vacation schedule.

Some people might disagree by saying that creativity would help the students in the long run, and while I beleive that creativity is a good thing, I also beleive that giving students an actual break over the summer could do a lot of good. This doesn't mean I think that students should have no work to do over the summer, but I do think that less is better in this case. The ""creativity"" that the students would be missing out on could easily bee made up during school hours, giving the students some breathing room over the summer.

Overall, I beleive that summer projects should be designed by the teachers, not by the students. Doing so would give the students enough work over the summer to actually retain information, but still giving them the break that they deserve. It would also give the students guidlines to work from, so that they may complete the assignment before any vacation plans that might prevent them from doing so.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
7F8AD2B6CCCC,"The idea that summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Should be student-designed cause for the whole school year teachers have assigned papers and projects that they think is a good idea which some of them are, but some of them are confusing and hard to some students.

As a student I feel as if we should come up with our own project, especially that some students want to be teachers one day get a head start on how to come up with a project for their students for the future. For example students may use their teachers project that they assigned them and put a twist on it something that is fun to work on,but teachers and some students think that it should be teacher-designed cause some students have a mindset and think teachers have been giving out projects all year why stop now. Which is a lazy mindset students should want to make their own project. One student might just go as far and say why can't it be both and the teachers and the students come up with a project and combine it which is great but as students get told to do these assignments and projects from their teacher and they are specific projects with a rubric there isnt much a student can do but go by what they are told from the rubric, no brainstorm ideas just get an A and go by the rubric. It should be student-designed cause students have their own ideas and what they can do to make a project better and look appealing you get a project from a teacher and a rubric and you are going off not what you think but the rubric what the teacher wants so every student is doing that, thats why all projects look the same and have the same idea and concept. Teachers argue that it should be teacher-designed because the students are going to do something thats not important like video games or sports not about academics and that is a valid argument, however how do they know what the students are going to do that if they don't get to make their own project. Teachers may say because it is the summer students won't do the project cause there have been assignments where they are given over the weekend and the students still won't do them so if they give the students a project over the summer they will defiantly not get it done which is false that project will be 60% of your grade for the new school year who doesn't want to start out with a perfect grade at the beginning of the year? some students will forget over the summer yes but when the school year is about to begin send an email to a parent or on the remind app so when the students do come back they are ready to present. I would like to see what students come up with and how they would present it students should be able to do summer projects with their rubric that they came up with and doing these student-designed projects will help them with a career and a job where they need to brainstorm and think of their own ideas instead of getting the exact directions handed to them. It also takes the stress off the teacher in thinking of a summer project, before the end of the year a student-designed project would be good and would benefit the students greatly.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
FE133737091E,"Some schools, require students to complete school related projects during holiday/seasonal break. Teachers, who give their students assignments to be completed during break are more likely create; a more educated student, responsable student, and a more ambicous student.

Teachers who assighn students work during holiday/seasonal breaks, are more likely to have greater test scores from students than teachers who don't assighn work to be completed during break. Study's show that teachers who assighn work during breaks are likely to have better test and quiz grade outcomes, do to students gaining extra practice and gaining more information on a unit that had prevously been taught before break. For example, students who complete assghnments that their teacher had assghined them to do and be completed during break have more study time which students gain more information and knowledge about the unit then a student who dosn't have work assghined to them, meaning students gain extra information and knowledge that they can use during test, quizzes, and class work when comming back from break do to teachers giving them work sheets to be complete at home making them more educated students.

Secoundly, students who are given work during holiday/seasonal break and complete the work that their teacher has assighned them, will become more responsable students. For instance, students who are assighned work and know that their work has to be completed by a certain Date and time, tend to focus on what's really improtant such as their grade in class. Students, know that completing the work on time and at the best of there abilty know that they will gain a good grade in the gradebook and will have a better grade in the classroom as well, But the students also know if the assighnments are not fully completed and on time that there consiquence maybe there grade will drop drastically due to them not completing the task their teacher has assighned forthem. Making the students that where assigned projects to be completed during break, more responsable then other students.

Furthmore, Teachers who have assighned projects to be completed during break are creating ambicous students, and not lazy students who dont want to do class work and assighnments during class time when it becomes time to come back from break. for exmaple,students know that they will be returning back to school when break is over causes students to not loose their focus for school and the their class work when time to come back to school and remembering that holiday/seasonal breaks are just breaks from the school envioment and from fellow class mates that you have been stuck with for a long time period of time. meaning this will cause students to understand that they will be returnng back to schoola nd when they do it will be back to the basic and usaul clas room setting, work, test and quizzes. students who analyize this thought in there mind while doing there work assighned to them on break will not become lazy students that don't want to do anything when they return back to school but instead cause a more ambicouse student who is willing to exceed expectaions from their teachers and their class work.

Summer projects that are assighned by and from teachers are tottaly nessacesary if you want more educated students, responsable students, and a more ambicouse students in your class room.

484D83483EAF,"Ring! the final bell has rung its now officially summer. Though there is still school work to be done, teachers have designed a summer assignment to complete. Although some may believe otherwise teachers should design summer projects because they know what they want students to learn and keeps students mind in shape

Your grocery shopping, and you discover you need milk. You know what milk you need to buy. Teachers are the same way over summer assignments. Teachers know what they want students to learn over summer. Learning the material a teacher assigns over summer ensures that the student will be ready for the upcoming class in the fall. It also keeps the students busy with work. If students didnt work they wouldnt be successful in life. An example is Mark Zuckerberg, he created Facebook. Mark had a dream about a giant social media platform that you can share things with anyone and keep in touch with friends all over the world anywhere and anytime. The next day Mark started Facebook from his basement. He went everywhere to get investors to invest in Facebook. The dream happened Facebook is currently the leading social media platform for millions of people. He wouldnt be where he is if he didnt work. Students should follow in his footsteps. Students should learn what teachers assign them, and be inspired to learn and work. Who knows maybe they will have the next big idea that will change the world.

Have you ever went to the gym and worked really hard and woke up the next morning barley being able to move. Your mind is the same way. It has to constantly be learning and reviewing to keep information. This helps teachers when assigning summer assignments. When school starts after the break students are familiar with topics from the assignment. If students dont do or review the assignment they will lose some of the learning they acquired from the past school year. This can happen to anyone, It has happened to me. I forgot to do my summer assignment during my freshman year. I walked into the first day of school clueless. I was lost and confused. Nothing made sense to me. It was almost like my teacher was speaking a entire different language. Now I make sure I do them so Im ready to learn on the first day. In addition, my friend Generic_Name she did her summer assignment. she had a pop quiz on the very first day of school. She got a 82%, if she didnt do her assignment she would have gotten a bad grade. Students should do the assignments teachers gives them. It keeps students from forgetting information, and students can even learn brand new information students have never learned before.

Some may say students should design summer projects because they know what they want to learn. About 67% of students have been over worked in the past year. This shows that students needs a break over summer.

They have completed 9 months of school non stop. Students don't want to learn anything else. Its now summer all they want is a break. They want to go hang out with friends, travel, etc. An example of this is my friend Generic_Name, She took 3 advanced placement classes in the past school year. She was in school for 7 hours a day and did homework for another 9 hours by herself. When summer hit all she did was relax and not stress over the work or test she would always have to rush and complete the next morning. She did 16 hours of school every day for 9 months. Shes not going to do any school work over summer, shes doesn't want to learn anything, all she wants is a break. If the summers projects were up to the students like Generic_Name the only assignment they would assign is to relax. As a result, she will most likely forget information she learned from the past year and put herself in more stress and work.

Teachers know what they want for students, and they design an assignment that helps students minds stay in shape. Students should embrace teachers assignments. They could really help a students future. They keep students busy. They help with not forgetting all the hard work students did in the past year. Teachers assignments are vital in summer its a teacher job to design them. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
5A3BABA1AE21,"I agree that some schools should let students do summer projects sometime over the summer. My main reasons are: staying active, not being lazy, and keeping your brain and yourself on track . During the summer you should want to go out and enjoy the outside world, you can do other things as well and to be creative about things for your school summer project, other than staying indoors and deciding to only sit around and do nothing.

First, the reason I said to stay active is because when you are outside you never know what you will find or discover if you are doing a project, or just simply exploring the world or the envoirment you live in. Discovering new things helps you think about nature and physical activity that is happening all around you. If you are doing a specific project, then maybe you should look for certain things outside, or even think about what would be great to add on to your project. Stay focused and try to look forward into new things that you see for your summer project.

Secondly, for my reason of not being lazy is mostly saying that instead of being at home watching television commercials, or being on your phone all the time, maybe even just sitting and play video games is way worse than enjoying yourself. You could be missing so much fun things that are just waiting for you to explore with outside. It could be new animals you never seen before, something interesting that you might want to experience or hanging with friends. They can even help you on your project to if you want them to join as well. Don't just sit around and put boring things on your project, or words that dont make any since to you or the topic of the project. You want to be creative with your ideas think positive about finding new things and most importantly ,have fun with what you are doing.

Although, you might not be lazy but you must have your brain and yourself on track at all times. School projects are made for you to have fun while doing them, and to meet new people if you are working in groups , or even if you are by yourself and still have positive thoughts for you and your project then everything its going just fine. You must make sure that you feel comfortable to do your school project and to have all the things you need to make your project creative, strong, and well written. Over the summer, you want to go places to enjoy your self and not to sit around and be off tasks all day long.

This section might be a little off topic but I just wanted to say , whatever you do over your summer break is up to you. You can be outside having fun or maybe even inside as well enjoying yourself. Some people would not like to do a creative project outside sometimes but that is okay as well because you can do your project inside too. A lot of times, projects can be for fun or just to be graded when you come back to school. While you are doing your project, it helps you learn more over the summer break and you become interested to do certain things over the break and thats fine to. Being creative is another way of saying, you got this no matter what.

In conclusion, have fun with your project. Don't be afraid to do anything with your project that mainly talks about you or what you like to do in your life. Doing projects makes kids want to do them more over time, and then they might just might, be able to describe many things specifically for their projects. Learning on the other hand, makes you think more than just to not think at all. Just remember, while you are doing these projects once again you must continue to have fun with them. Tell about your life, family, or other and to have a great summer as well.",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
7D6CAE9CA2C1,"Does your school require a summer project? Would you rather be able to choose the subject of said project? If a student chooses their subject they would most likely: not get bored, enjoy the project, and get a better grade. If a teacher assigns a summer project with a specific topic that the student wouldn't want to talk about, would make the summer a bore.

If the student chooses their topic it will be something they have interest in, therefore they will enjoy doing the project. If they enjoy the project they won't get bored, and if they don't get bored then there will be a better finished product rather than the rushed, I don't want to do this, procrastinated project that the teacher would get if it was on a topic set by the teacher.

In the end, if the student picks their topic, there will be a better outcome for everyone. Every student wants the freedom of being able to do something they enjoy in school. If everything you do in school is what the teacher wants then the students will get bored, therefore getting lazy and making the teacher look bad. We don't want teachers to look bad, because we as students need them in order to better our lives, so therefore a summer project should be on a topic the student picks.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
CFA85271A07D,"Imagine being a student on summer break and still letting your teacher decide what project you are doing, would you want that? While some may say that teacher designed projects over the summer time are better, I disagree with that statement. Letting students make their own projects for summer lets them have more creativeness, it makes the project easier on them, and could lets them enjoy their projects a lot more since they dont have to follow some guidelines. I know I would want to have a student designed project especially since its summer time. When students get their own student designed project it lets them have more creativeness, easier projects, and lets them have more fun with their project.

When a student gets to design his or her own project it lets them be creative which will lead to a better project. Creativeness leads to great things, something that is emphasized by almost every teacher. In addition, a student project that is designed by them is the science fair and some amazing projects come out of that every year. When you are stuck following guidelines their is not much to do with your project, when I had to make my own project I got an A+ on it. Creativeness leads to overall better projects, which teachers will like more.

Students making there own project lets them have an easier time with the project. They know the own guidelines and rules since they designed the project. I know when I was in this situation I benefited a lot from letting me make my own guidelines to follow make the project easier for me to do. When the project is easier that gives me more motivation to do it, so all my time spent on the project is productive. Students benefit a lot when they are doing something that comes easy to them.

While making your own project it lets you enjoy your time working on the project. Working on a project where you are having fun and enjoying yourself is a much better experience than just slugging it out. Their is a saying that ""time flies when you're having fun,"" that could apply to the project too. When Im having fun it leads to better results and a less amount of work time. Also, why would a teacher not want you to have fun while you're on summer break.

Some could argue that teacher designed projects are better due to them being more structured and proper. Student designed projects are still the better option, when a student is creative it leads to an overall better project. They also have an easier time with the project, which leads to more motivation to do the project and get it over with. Also , actually enjoying the project leads to an overall better and less amount of work time. Student designed projects are the way to go because, it lets them be creative, makes the project easier, and lets them enjoy their time working on the project.         ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

The trees are so green that you almost forget that just a few months ago, they were bare. You can see and hear kids laughing and swimming at the local pools and parks and you can taste the cool ice pop on in our mouth after playing with your friends into the summer night. It is perfect, so perfect that you almost forget about your summer assignment. That dreadful assignment your teacher made up that holds no interest to you and that you have been procrastinating all summer. You know it is important to do, but you struggle because it ruins the fun and excitement of your summer. You wish you could have made your own project up to still get the benefit of learning, but not have to deal with the pain of a boring assignment created by an adult teacher. Summer projects that help students continue to learn during the summer breaks should be student designed and created and not teacher created.

Summer is a time for students to get a break from school. The school year is a hard and busy time for students and throughout the entire year, they never catch a break from assignments and assessments in school. Summer allows for students to take the much needed mind break and reset for the following year. While yes, there is an important meaning behind giving summer assignments, when they resemble school work and involve readings or worksheets, a student does not fully get the break they deserve. Students who are able to design their own projects would have a better desire to want to complete them during their summer. Being able to create their own projects as a student also gives the illusion that it is not school work and they are still on their summer break, not just in school.

In addition to a break from school, students motivation in the summer time drops. School is a good way to keep a student on track and completing their work, but when there is not a teacher or building to keep students going, the motivation their is to complete a task is dropped. School assignments, and summer ones, also tend to refer only to a specific topic which a student might not be interested in which could cause them to not do it or rush it and not do their best work. When a student designs a project, they will want to make it something they will enjoy doing. By giving student that option, it eliminates the fact that the school project is something that they would hate. If a person is interesting in doing something they will spend time on it and plan time to do it.

Not only is not getting a break and having the motivation reasons a student should design their own summer assignment, but also the idea that if a student likes the project they are doing and puts effort into it, it allows the teacher to see what the student is like and how they work. Having this advantage can help a teacher structure their school year to appeal to the students which in turn will help them not only succeed on their summer project but throughout the entire school year. Teachers would also get the opportunity to see what students had designed and did during the summer when they create their own project. It could be argued that a student could take advantage of this and make a super simple project or make a sloppy assignment, however that is the students choice. While this would be an issue, the student would have most likely cheated or not have done a good job on the assignment the teacher would have given so why not let the students who actually care enjoy their project and do it well.

Summer time is a time for play and fun, not to be focused on school work. But we all know that is impossible so instead of spending your summer doing long and boring teacher assigned projects, students should be able to design their own and show off themselves and add to the enjoyment of summer. The summer assignments a students creates would give them the knowlogege while still getting a school break, the motivation and want to complete it, and finally the teacher would get to know the student on a personal level within the first few days of school which is important for the students school year. This is why school summer projects should be student designed. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
3F44E430D0AF,"It's the last day of school, you're sitting in your desk leg bouncing anxiously waiting for the final bell to ring. That bell of freedom, but just a minute before it rings your teacher reminds the class of the most dreaded thing on the planet, the student summer project.

Everybody groans in disdain, but the feeling of dread is washed away with the final chime of the squeaky high pitched freedom cry. You're now a month into your three month summer break and your project pops into your mind, but is brushed off quickly with the though of ""I'll do it later"". More time goes by, one month, then the next. Now its four days before the first day of school and you're laying in bed thinking ""oh this is bad"". This happens to students almost everywhere you look on earth, Massive procrastination that doesn't end until its too late. How do we curb this? I believe the best option is the Teacher Designed Summer Project, TDSP for short, and here's why.

My First reason for thinking the TDSP is better than the SDSP(student designed summer project) is that students can be just flat out lazy. Using myself as an example, I am a very lazy student. I dont turn things in on time, whenever I do turn things in on time normally they're haphazardly put together and not very cohesive. I know that if our school were to have a SDSP many students, myself included, would not get them done because we believe we have many better things that we could be doing with our time, or we just do not want to do it. If these projects were headed up by a teacher, it would help direct the many students like me.

My next reason on why the TSDP is better is that many students dont know what they want to do with their life once they leave high school. With the help of a specialized TDSP teacher and or counselor, the students can be lead to something that they genuinely enjoy, instead of something that makes them want to pull their hair out every day. A specialized TSDP teacher would know their students and their aspirations in life and can help them form ideas and keep them on the right track through the three months.

My final point on why the TDSP is better, which tacks onto my last point, is that it could encourage kids to pursue something that they love and take charge of their future. With the help of a TDSP teacher, students like me could start to find a calling in life, something that we genuinely enjoy and want to keep doing. That's not something that would happen with students like me if we had no direction.

There are some drawbacks to the TDSP however. The first reason would be it might put more stress on the students in a time where we are supposed to be relaxing from school work to take time for ourselves. The second drawback is that it would put more strain on the school system to pay certain TDSP teachers through the summer, and it would also take precious summer time away from those said TDSP teachers. The third drawback would be that it is catered towards people who are somewhat lazy, restricting the students that are not to a bound path.

It's hard for me to admit that, being one of the students that believes that summer projects are horrible, I still believe that the teacher lead summer project is the best route to go. It keeps students on track with the school, you form a tighter bond with a teacher, and you start to figure out what you want to do on this big blue sphere. Many students will not like it at first, and they wont want to give it the light of day, But they'll cone around. It pains me to say that, even though it would be taking away from my precious summer time, I believe that the Pros of the TDSP out way the cons and that it might just be the solution to our problems.         ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
943611A73135,"In all reality I feel that if a school system wants a childs brain to blossom with ideas and learn how to be creative then the teachers should let the students design their own project for example; when I was younger I had to do a project for school and I did not like the reading project that was assigned it didnt let my creativity flow and I couldnt get into the book. Kids like to explore and find new things to do. Let a kid be a kid dont assign them something they would not find fun over the summer.

I would like to begin with, when i was young and i had to do a reading assignment over summer i didnt do it because it wasnt what i craved and wanted to do,i wanted to be a explorer and find new things and played in the mud. I went around and tried to find things that interested me and I started to collect bugs and tried to find out what they was and when i went back to school i told my teacher that i collected bugs and found out the names of them and i proceed to ask her if i could write a essay since i did not do the reading project and she let me do the essay about bugs. so my creativity was able to flow out and i found out something that i enjoyed doing that i did not know liked doing.

In addition to, children like to find stuff to do and not realize it could be bad and not understand the out come so let a kid be a kid and be creative so they can explore their minds and find something they enjoy doing and summer is about having fun and hanging out with your friends and family. I think kids do not do the assignments that are assigned to them because they do not find it interesting, a kid need to find something interesting in order to want to do it. If they can not design their projects for summer then they should not have to do them, i feel that when a child has the opportunity to do something that they find creative then they will end up doing it.

To end with, summer is all about taking a break from school and being free teachers should not assign projects to students they should not feel like they are forced to do something when they can let their mind explore and learn new thing on their own. If a teacher just gives out a project and is like here do this over summer then the student might not find it interesting and not do it. If students are able to design their own projects and be them self then their minds can bloom into some beautiful and amazing they will find out a new part of them self that they never knew they had.

In conclusion, a student should be able to design their own project so they can discover more about them self that they never knew existed. When It comes to teachers giving out summer projects i can see why some students may not complete it because they could find it boring or they just arent interested in doing it, thats why i think summer projects should be student designed and they should be forced to do a project that they dont find interesting. So if school assign summer projects let the students design the project and see what type of response you get back. Remember summer isnt about doing work its about being able to have fun with family and friends. ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
3E2DD51983F4,"Summer is the longest break students get. Every kid loves the hot summers and playing outside. The only downside to summer is the fact that most kids forget a lot of what they learned throughout the school year. Majority of kids are more focused on having a fun summer than they are on retaining their knowledge, which is why summer projects were created. Although, some students take no breaks from their education, teachers should be the ones designing the students' summer projects so those children can continue learning during break.

A protruding factor that supports the position that teachers should plan the summer projects for students is that the teachers are the masters of what they are teaching. Teachers go to school to study and learn about the subject they are teaching so they know more about it than the students do. For example, a teacher goes to school for four years to study physics and teaching. Then, they go on to teach that subject to students. Since they have a degree in those areas of studies that proves their credibility to them knowing what they are doing. While some students may be well educated on a subject, a teacher has a degree, which shows they hold superior knowledge and really know how to get a student to learn a subject the right way. Therefore, teacher's should design student summer projects.

Another prime point to key in on is the fact that teachers are more experienced than the students by a large margin. Most teacher's have been educators for years, and even if they have not, they have been in the field for years. Becoming a teacher is something that takes time. What has to be kept in mind is that they once were students too, so they know what is best to do or give to help their students continue learning. My aunt, for example, studied mathematics for four years in college and is now a math teacher at a high school nearby. She knows what is best to do for her students to learn because she once had to learn it all too. Although students have experience in the learning field, teachers are more experienced and know what is the best way to design a project for students to continue learning even through breaks.

One under minded factor that should be considered when determining whether teachers should design the summer project is the level of maturity teachers hold compared to students. Teachers are much older than their students, as a result, they are more experienced in the world, which makes them more mature. For example, if I were given the opportunity to make my own summer project, I would make it as short and easy as possible. This shows my immaturity as a kid because i want to spend as little time learning in the summer as possible and use the rest of that time to have fun. My math teacher on the other hand, realizes that summer is long and if the students do not do any math over the summer, then they will forget a lot. To prevent that, she gives out lengthy math packets so her students can continue learning. This shows her maturity in her realization of how important it is for a student to continue learning even through breaks. While some students may be mature, teachers are more mature than the majority of their students. Thus, teachers should be given the responsibility of designing summer projects.

Even though some students are serious learners day in and day out, teachers should be the ones planning out the summer projects for students. Children are focused more on having fun than they are on furthering their education during any break. Summer is no exception, for some it is a resting time, but for most it is an opportunity to slack off on their education. Teachers know how to keep the kids learning, nevertheless, the teachers should do the teaching and the students should do the learning. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
2DDDB7AA7C51,"The last thing a student wants to hear is that they have a project over their summer break. Why not make it fun for them? The school year is when students are taught a certain curriculum and then at the end of the year given a final exam or project. Summer break is a chance to break away from that structure which is why school projects that are over the summer should be designed by the students. These projects should be student-designed because the students can chose something they are interested that relates to school and it builds independent skills.

It could be a student or a CEO. When people are interested in something, they make it a priority. It is why student-designed projects are the best option. An example would be school clubs such as DECA and FCCLA. These are national student organizations that are simply supervised by school officials but headed by the students. These clubs do operate year round which is what makes it great for summer projects. These clubs prepare students for post secondary life and provide educational and real world skills in a variety of subjects students could be interested in. Students also must utilize skills from school such as presenting, writing, and research in any given area. Having student-designed projects within their interests will help their future and make learning more enjoyable.

To enter the workforce or college, a student needs to be a well rounded individual to succeed. Student- designed projects will be a foundation for those independent skills they will need. DECA and FCCLA will provide several of those skills such as leadership, teamwork, people skills, critical thinking, managing a business, and more. These organizations are also competitive with certain subject areas which also encourages skills like studying, or hands on skills such as demonstrating or teaching. In the TV show Degrassi, a group of high school juniors come together to do a project over break for their school. This project had consisted of research on the history of their community and how to make it better. To do this project, they needed to gather information, use teamwork, utilize critical thinking skills, and present in front of the school board. In a similar manner to the organizations already mentioned, they also gained valuable skills of leadership, managing, and teaching. While it was directly related to their school, unlike FCCLA and DECA. They also shared the skills of motivation and organization with FCCLA and DECA but they took a different approach.

There are many ways to have a productive, educational, and fun summer project for schools everywhere. It all starts with students designing their projects to build independent skills and choosing to work on something that is interesting to them. While teacher designed projects will help them with their current school and build skills for the academic side of their future which is important, they are more for the immediate. Students now are the future, therefore these reasons listed are why they must be designed by the students. Giving students a path to becoming better and more successful citizens.              ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
DC778C27E995,"Most students dislike summer assignments, could that change if they desgined the assignment themselves? Summer assignments can be a chore that students are unhappily forced to complete. I believe that if students could design their own summer projects they would be more willing to complete it because it promotes creativity, gives them control over how they do their project, and gives it an overall feeling that its not just another boring assignment.

Others could say that without direction students wouldn't know what to do. However; without that direction students can have full creativity over what they do. From multiple tests i've seen, when a student is allowed to work how they want their creativity and willingness to work increases tenfold. Given the opportunity to be creative on their own, students can and will be more productive and willing to complete an assignment.

No one likes to be told what to do, this is all the same for students. If students are given control over how they work on projects and assignments they are much more productive. The freedom a student can feel when given control over a project will only encourage them to continue learning throughout the summer.

School can be a boring and repetitive place for students, multiple assignments all feeling the same can wear them down. When summer rolls around its a breathe of relief, until they realize there is still more learning to do. If students designed their own project however, that could all change and very well could be excited to actually continue learning throughout the summer.

In conclusion, students dislike assignments, especially during the summer. But if a student was allowed to design and create it themselves it would not only promote creativity, give them control over the project allowing them to not feel chained to the rules, and give them the mindset that they are not just completing another assignment.                     ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
CD0E358CA76C,"During school, students are constantly testing their knowledge by learning new things, but throughout summer break when school is not in session, students often forget what they were taught during the school year. Most projects assigned to students are teacher-designed, even though a student-designed project would be more beneficial towards their education.

Although a teacher-designed summer project serves as a guideline for topics the student should focus on, student-designed summer projects are more efficient because they teach students to be more creative, help the students decide a method that could help them remember what they learned during the school year, and allows the student to work at their own pace without stress.

When learning something new, creativity plays a significant part in success. Students who apply their creativity to a project are more likely to enjoy and learn from their assignment rather than those who choose not to. For example, if a student was given a writing assignment and allowed to write whatever they desire, the student's interest would spark and their creativity would show. Another example is if students worked on project in groups; The group members would be allowed to combine their creativity to create a successful piece.

Decision-making is a key component to life, therefore students should be allowed to make their own decisions when it comes to creating a project. For example, if a student was asked to do a book report by their English teacher, the student should be allowed to decide how they would like to present. This method helps the student learn because they are incorporating their own methods and decisions. By doing this, the student is incorporating their learning capabilities into a work of their own, thus allowing them to successfully learn the topic.

Learning at another's pace rather than oneself is an inefficient way to learn new information. Therefore, a teacher incorporating their way of working into a project is unacceptable for a student's learning process. For example, a student who is given homework should be able to complete it without a deadline because the student would be working at their own pace and learn from what they are practicing rather than stressing about the deadline. Also, when stress is involved in learning, students are less likely to complete their assigments because they will have anxiety attempting to start.

In conclusion, student-designed summer projects are more efficient beacuse they teach students to be more creative, help the students decide a method that could help them remember what they learned during the school year, and allow the student to work at their own pace to prevent stress. Teachers should allow students to design their own projects because it motivates them to learn how they want to learn. If teacher-designed projects continue to be incorporated, students will be less likely to complete their projects while learning new topics. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
61D5DB6C54F7,"Everyone loves the summer, but the one thing that students do not look forward to, is summer projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students will procrastinate when choosing the project, students will make the project too easy, and teachers are more experienced than students.

School can be very stressful for a student, but that might not always fall on the teacher. Students tend to make things harder for themselves by waiting at the last minute to complete assignments, especially when they are given more freedom on the project. Summer is the best time of the year for a student and they do not want to spend that time thinking of what topic or project they should choose. Students will procrastinate and wait to the very last minute to come up and complete their assignment. If a teacher picked the assignment, they can give students the tools and structure they need to make an A+ worthy project.

Right after the final bell to signal the start of summer, a student earns a sense of freedom and accomplishment. Summer is the time where students want to sit back, relax, and soak it all in. That's why if the summer project was designed by a student, the project would be way too easy. In the summer, all students want is the time to be young. To go out with friends and enjoy a warm summer night. But having a summer project to come up with gets in the way of that time. Students would want to get back to that time as soon as possible. Therefore, the students would make a project so easy that it would in no way benefit them. Students will find a way to make the easiest, and least time consuming activity for a project. Teachers, however can design a project with the right difficulty to help a student move forward with their learning, while also insuring the best summer vacation possible for the students.

During the 182 day school year teachers have a lot of projects and assignments to come up with. That's why when designing a summer project, teachers are the perfect people for the job. Students aren't as experienced as teachers when it comes to coming up with a project. Teachers make many projects over the course of the school year and they most likely have gotten the formula down by the time summer comes to a start. Teachers know how to structure and execute a project to help students learn to their fullest potential.

In conclusion summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have a better ability to structure a project, students will tend to procrastinate when given freedom on a project, and students will limit themselves by making the project way too easy. At the end of the day, summer projects are made to help students maintain their ability to learn over the summer and I believe that teachers are the people best suited to help students grow during their summer vacation.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
909404A6C673,"Students are usually on their phones and doing other mindless tasks during summer break, and they don't stimulate their brains. As a result, some schools assign summer projects to ensure that their students learn over the summer and are better prepared for the next school year. These schools debate on assigning teacher-designed projects, which have specific guidelines, or student-designed projects, which allow for more creative freedom. These summer projects should be student-designed because students would be able to personalize their projects, the projects would be more enjoyable, and the students would put in more effort into their products.

With student-designed projects, students are able to express their own creative styles. For example, in an interior design class, the summer project could be to design the students' dream house. One student may excel in drawing, so they could draw their dream house. Another student may excel in graphic design, so they could create a three-dimensional model of their dream house on a computer. Lastly, another student may like Legos, so they could build their dream house out of Legos. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects would minimize the creative freedom because they would set specific guidelines on how they want their students to complete it. All in all, students can complete their projects using the unique skills they have with student-designed projects.

Also, students would find the projects more fun if they are able to design it. Summer break is a time for students to have fun. When a teacher designs a project, there are usually set guidelines on how they want the project, which sometimes isn't what students would enjoy. This would make it difficult for students to find the motivation to complete their projects, especially over summer break. On the other hand, with student-designed projects, students would be able to personalize their projects, so they could use their own interests to complete it. When students are able to individualize their projects, they find it more enjoyable to complete since they would include aspects that they enjoy and minimize aspects of the project they could potentially dislike. For example, in the previously mentioned interior design summer project, the student who excels in drawing could dislike using computers. If the teacher had required the dream house to be made on the computer, the drawer could find it difficult to finish the project because they don't enjoy using computers. In contrast, if the drawer was able to design their own project, then they could draw their dream house while having fun.

Lastly, in student-designed projects, students would put more effort into completing their projects. Generally, students put more effort into the subjects that they enjoy. Similarly, if students are able to design their own projects, they would enjoy completing the projects and work harder on them. If the previously mentioned interior design teacher required everyone to build their dream house out of Legos, the student who draws and the student who enjoys graphic design would enjoy the project less and find little motivation to complete it over the summer. As a result, the drawer and graphic designer would put minimal effort into their Lego dream house, for they may just build a house with little detail and minimal unique thinking. On the other hand, if the dream house project was a student-designed project, the students would put a lot of effort into creating their dream house since they are able to design it with the skills that they have and enjoy using.

Some may argue that students could design the summer projects so they require minimum effort since they want to complete their projects as quickly as possible. However, when you give students creative freedom, they are more likely to put in extra effort because they would enjoy their projects more. Schools that require summer projects should assign student-designed projects because students are able to use their unique skills and interests to complete these projects. Additionally, students would have more fun completing these projects since they are allowed to express their own creativeness, which helps motivate the students to complete it during summer break. Lastly, students are more likely to work harder on their projects because they would find their student-designed projects more enjoyable to complete.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
72C7213E24ED,"The bane of many students existence are summer projects. Many students dread having to complete yet more schoolwork during the time in which they are supposed to be taking a break from school. Though we may not enjoy summer assignments, it can not be denied that they do help students retain information over the summer. Some people feel that these summer assignment should be guided by the students, while others feel the teacher should design the project. In my opinion, summer projects should be teacher designed because the teacher can ensure that students are learning what they think is important, it outlines what students need to do so that they do not have to stress about making their own project, and students can assist each other due to the projects being uniform.

If the teacher designs the project, they can ensure that what the students are learning over the summer is going to benefit them when summer break ends. If students are allowed to make their own projects, the risk of them researching something unimportant or irrelevant is not unlikely. When a teacher designs the project, they can make sure that everything students are learning over the summer is important and relevant to their class. When I was in elementary school, we were assigned summer reading. This summer assignment was intended to help us improve at reading and to last most of the summer. No book list was given so we were free to choose any book we pleased. As a result, many kids chose to read short, easy books in order to complete the project as quick, and with as little effort, as possible. This puts them at a disadvantage as they did not get the same reading and word practice that other kids got. Teachers should design summer projects in order to make sure students learn what is necessary for the class.

If students are given a summer assignment by their teacher, they are more likely to complete it over the summer, rather than last minute. As a student, knowing exactly what I have to do for the assignment makes it easier for me to complete them over time. This is because I know exactly what I need to do to finish the project, thus I can plan as to when I will complete each part of the project. To have the student design the project would add an extra layer of stress over coming up with and completing a project. This leads to them putting it off until they run out of time and have to rush their project to turn it in. When they wait until the last minute, they are likely to retain less information than if they did the project throughout the summer. During the transition from eighth to ninth grade, I was assigned a summer reading of a Greek mythology book. Along with the book, I was given a reading guide to fill out and turn in when school started. Having the reading guide allowed me to split up the reading and complete it over time. I could complete a page of the reading guide and then take a break, then pick it up another day and complete another page. Overall, teacher designed summer projects encourage students to complete their assignment over the summer through providing a structure that students can follow.

Teacher created summer assignments promote collaboration as they are identical across students, allowing students to discuss with and help each other. This collaboration allows them to have better projects and learn more about the topic they are required to research. Students can share what they know in order to learn from each other. Some students are better at certain topics than others, if they can combine their knowledge with that of others they will improve their understanding of the topics. With no teacher to ask over the summer, their peers are the only one they have access to. Students can get help from their classmates and both improve their assignment, and their relationship. Being able to ask for help is greatly beneficial to students as ,otherwise, they would just leave it be and never be able to correct it. Going back to my Greek mythology summer reading, every student had to read the same book that I was. I was able to ask my classmates what they thought about certain parts of the book that I did not understand. This collaboration allowed me to better understand the book and succeed in that unit when I returned to school. Creating uniform summer projects promotes help and collaboration between students.

In conclusion, summer assignments should be teacher created so that teachers can make sure students learn what is necessary, students actually do the assignment over the summer, and to allow students to work together on the assignment. I believe that it would not only benefits students, but also the teacher. The point of summer assignments is to help students retain or learn information. The teacher knows best what students need to learn over the summer to be successful when school begins. Teacher created summer assignments provide many benefits over student designed summer assignments and is the best way for students to learn over the summer",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
D54821935AA6,"One topic that is frequently debated is if summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Some people think is better if it is teacher-designed. They feel that students will follow the same path. I believe that it should be student-designed because the projects will be created differently, there may be different information in each project and students will prove their capacity to do their own project.

The projects will be created differently. Students have different ideas on how to do a project. There is variety of ideas on how to do a project. Students can choose any way on how to do it, depending on what the project is about. Some students are more creative than other students. They may have different types of creativity. By doing this project students will show if they are still learning. They will show that they are learning even if they do not go to school.

Every project may have different information. Students have different ideas on projects. The projects are always different from other students. Students do not have the same brain which means they will not have the same information. Some students like to write what comes to their mind instead of getting information by searching it. Some students will have quality of information and other will have simple words.

Students will prove their capacity to do their own project. More then showing capacity to do their own project, is more to know who is responsible,organized and where they are on a specific topic. Teachers will know on who to trust for example, I would trust more on a responsible student. Students will demonstrate to the teacher how much effort they out into a project. By doing the project students may improve and have a good grade to begin with.

In conclusion,some people will still think it is better if it is teacher-designed. They feel that students will follow the same path. I still believe that it should be student-designed because the projects will be created differently, there may be different information on each project and student will prove their capacity to do their own project.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
FEC8B95B3459,"Summertime is by far the most favored season among students. Students of all ages get to relax and not have to worry about what time the bus comes or what day their six-page lab report is due. Three months of no worries is something that anyone could dream for, and students are fortunate to get it every year. Some could even argue that summer is too short, considering that we only get three months of break compared to the nine months we are in school. Nevertheless, summer is a gift for all the hard work students put in all year. As great as summer may appear to be, there is sometimes a downside that is tied to school: summer projects and assignments. Usually, the words ""summer"" and ""assignment"" are not supposed to go in the same sentence; but in some instances, schools give assignments to students over the summer so they are not unprepared for the arrival of the next school year. These assignments are meant to be helpful rather than work to keep you busy. Most students think these assignments are not right to give, and prefer to design the projects themselves if they must have them. For many obvious reasons, students should not design their own summer projects, for it is the teachers that truly know what will better them as students.

Although student-designed summer projects may seem like an advantage to the student, it is very much the opposite. If a student designs something for themselves to be able to learn, they would not know what their supposed to do. With no real knowledge of the curriculum, how would a student be more well suited to create an assignment for themselves? Students need the teachers to set things up for them because they are the professionals that get paid to make these projects. The teacher will always know what is best for the student whether the student chooses to accept that or not. Summer projects are not always the most fun to do, but teachers construct them in order to benefit the student. Similar to the saying ""mother knows best,"" teachers know what is best for the student. Summer assignments should result in gratefulness toward teachers rather than resentment; because it is those same teachers who give the assignments that care the most about the student's future and wants them to be challenged. The bigger picture of these assignments should be thought about rather than seeing them as absolute burdens. Just trust and believe in the process.

Next, if a student makes his/her own assignment, they would not push the limits of their own ability. In reality, if something could come easy rather than difficult for someone, the odds of taking the difficult path are slim to none. For example, a student is given the opportunity to write an essay on any topic they choose to. That may seem like an advantage to the student, but in reality is a disadvantage. The student will choose a subject that is very familiar to them because it is the safest to dive into. Doing what is easy defeats the whole purpose of what is supposed to strengthen a student. Teachers giving assignments is a more sensible concept because they know what will benefit the student. The whole purpose of assignments and projects being assigned rather than student-designed is to break students out of their comfort zone. Testing their abilities and seeing what they are capable of gives a better evaluation of the student. A student's willingness to work is crucial to their future as well as other aspects of life. Student-designed projects are not usually given because they do not display true capabilities. A task must be given to a student to determine their ability to go above and beyond.

Lastly, teacher-designed summer assignments give the student a better understanding of what to expect for the upcoming school year. To illustrate, a new student could newly enroll in the school after moving from another state. The standards compared from their old school to the new school are likely to be different, leaving the student oblivious to what they will endure. The summer assignment is a preview for the year, showing what the student should expect to experience throughout the duration of the year. Summer projects also refresh students to how school goes so they are not going into the new year unprepared. Every student, for the most part, comes back to school rusty after summer break. Handwriting is crooked, having to adjust to the new schedule, even forgetting the log-in and password to the computer. All of those things are expected because those things are taken out of the daily schedule that students endure. All of those things also make teacher-designed summer projects all the more effective as refreshment. Doing those projects get students back in the swing of things, as well as providing a head start for the new year.

To conclude, it is essential to students that their teachers design their summer projects. There are no real advantages to students designing their own summer assignments, whether students realize that or not. Teachers work everyday to better the education and future of their students; which means they know what is better for their students in the grand scheme of things. Although they may seem like a drag, summer assignments are meant to give a taste of what the new year will bring. A teacher would not give an assignment that provides no benefit to the student. Teachers are always a step ahead and know what is beneficial and not. Let them continue to do what they do best, which is help students go forward.                                                                     ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
7359BD785A25,"At many schools, summer projects are assigned to students. These projects are usually either an essay or a research project. Currently, these projects are strictly designed by teachers without any say from the students. Should teachers be dictating what students must spend their days doing during both the school year and the summer months? Would it be more beneficial for students' education if they were able to design their own project? Summer projects should be designed by students because there is more room for creativity, it is more sustainable for students to accomplish, and students will be more driven to work on it.

Summer projects should be designed by students because there is more room for creativity. Creativity is an important skill to have, so a student-designed project will definitely help students in that area to use after they graduate. Imagination and creativity is much more of a key factor in student-designed projects than ones designed by teachers. When each student is allowed to come up with their own idea, plan it out, and create the project with little to no restriction or guidelines, there is more room for each student to show their individuality and original ideas. Without teachers telling students precisely what they want to see when summer break is over, students can let their imaginations run wild and create something that they are proud of.

Students should be the ones designing summer projects because they would be more sustainable for everyone. Many students in high school have summer jobs in order to help support their families. A teacher might assign a project that is far to lengthy for some students to complete in addition to their daily eight-hour shifts and having to take care of their younger siblings. These students' grades would sink the second the new school year starts due to their inability to finish the time consuming summer project by the first day of school. If every student were able to design their own project, they would be able to create one that is more sustainable and able to fit into their busy schedule.

Projects assigned over the summer should be designed by students because they will be more driven to work on it. Some might say that isn't the case, because students might not take the project as seriously as they would if it was designed by a teacher. On the other hand, if students were able to design their own projects, they would be able to choose a topic to research and write about that interests them. Therefore, they will be more inclined to complete it and will take the project even more seriously than they would if it was designed by a teacher. Student-designed projects would cause students to be driven by their interest in the topic they picked; instead of by the need to get it done before school starts. This would not only lead to more competed projects, but the projects would also have a lot more time and effort put into them.

In conclusion, it would be more beneficial for students' education to design their own projects. This would lead to more room for creativity, being more sustainable for students to accomplish, and students are more driven to work on it. This matters because what students do and learn now will affect the rest of their life. Students being able to do their own project or research over the summer could lead to students improving their work ethic and even finding their true interests.

07970BC175FC,"Some schools require students complete a summer project to assure they continue learning during their break.

Many students; however, are typically done with the school year before it is even over, they want nothing more than to leave and enjoy their break.

It is difficult for some students to pay attention and do their work in the final weeks of school, so to be sure students will complete their projects, the teacher should not make it themselves.

Summer projects should be designed by students to make sure they are interested, and to make sure they have a say in how much work should go into it.

Students should not be expected to do a lot of work during their summer break.

That is their time off, their time to relax and clear their minds.

The project that they are required to do should not be difficult, and it should not require an unrealistic amount of time and effort to complete it.

They should not have to work for an extended period of time to complete a project that may or may not even be graded.

That is why it should be up to the students to decide what the project is going to be and how much time it should take to complete it.

It is important for the students to come up with their own project ideas so they stay interested when it comes time to work on them.

It could be hard for students to complete a project that was assigned to them that has not peaked their interest.

It goes without saying that if a project is assigned to them by a teacher then it might not be fun or interesting to the student.

There is no way to tell if something will be interesting to someone unless they come up with the idea themselves.

It is a possibility that students will not take the project seriously.

It might not matter regardless of if the project was assigned to them or they came up with the idea.

Students might also think that, since they are on summer break, there is no reason to do the work because they assume that they will not have to turn the project in.

Or they could try to get away with doing the bare minimum so that they can get credit for completing the assignment.

There is no way to force a student to do work, but the chances are that the students that didn't complete the project were not going to do it, even if it was assigned by a teacher.

In conclusion, it should be up to students to design the projects they have to do over summer break so that they are interested, and they know exactly what they have to do.

Students are already expected to do a lot of work during the school year, if they are also expected to do work during summer break it should be something that they choose to work on.

E48C4A808FB2,"Summer projects are one of the most common forms of ensuring that students continue learning during their long summer break. These projects allow students to keep the information and experience that they learned through their school year throughout the summer. However, though the purpose and need of the summer projects may be valid, they are not interesting and motivating projects for students to complete, and, as such, students tend to procrastinate in completing their projects and learn less from the project thereby defeating its very purpose. The result of such a summer project, is the loss of knowledge gained by students in the past year, bad grades at the start of the new school year, and the unpreparedness of the students to return to school in a higher level class. Due to the fact that teachers are adults who prioritize the imbuement of knowledge into students, they are, at times, unable to make the summer projects they assign motivating to the students thereby resulting in this kind of summer projects. Summer projects should be student-designed because it will prevent the procrastination of students on the projects, allow students to absorb more from the project itself, and make the summer project more appealing for the students to complete.

One of the most important reasons why summer projects must be designed by students is to prevent the procrastination of students in the completion of said project. Due to the fact that summer projects tend to be rigorous and tiring, students tend to avoid completing the project until the very last second, which can result in a poor project, the students being unable to recall the learnings of their past year, and even causing them to be unprepared for the challenges of a higher level course. However, if the summer projects were student-designed, they would make it interesting for other students while including the necessary content under teacher supervision. By doing so, students who have to complete the assignment would be more motivated and interested in completing the summer project and would, therefore, not wait till the last second. Due to the last minute efforts by the students, students may feel the need to copy another person's summer project in order to simply make the deadline that they had forgotten about. This cheating would only lead to the students learning nothing from the project, being unprepared for their new higher level class, and learning to cheat on school work. To mitigate or prevent that situation, summer projects should be student-designed, so students would avoid their procrastination all together. Summer projects should be student-designed in order to prevent the procrastination of students thereby allowing them to fulfill the purpose of their summer project.

Though preventing the procrastination of students on the project is indeed one of the greatest benefits of having summer projects being student-designed, another key benefit of this is for it to allow students to absorb and learn more from the project. Due to the fact that summer projects can be tiring and complicated, students tend to absorb little from their completion besides what they must already know. This leads to students being unprepared for their new classes and also deprived of knowledge that was just before their eyes. By having student-designed summer projects, which will be more appealing to the students, students will try harder and be more invested in their projects, therefore allowing them to gain more from their projects than what they normally would. On normal summer projects, students tend to fill out the project with out actually understanding what they're doing. By having student-designed summer projects, students are more interested in the project and due to that fact, they are more likely to understand more about the concepts behind the project itself. Summer projects should be designed by students in that it will allow students to learn more from the summer projects than what they normally would.

Preventing the procrastination of students in the summer and allowing them to learn more from the summer projects are both important benefits of having student-designed summer projects, however, none of those benefits would even be possible without the fact that student-designed summer projects are much more invigorating to complete than a normal summer project to a student. Students have the unique advantage of understanding what students like and dislike which gives them a enormous advantage when it comes to creating a summer project for other students. This advantage is why more students will be interested in completing their summer projects which lead to them not procrastinating and absorbing more knowledge from the project. Student-designed summer projects will be naturally be more appealing to students because it would be designed to inspire their interests and therefore their concentration and focus.

Summer projects are a way for students to learn and develop even in the summer when there is no school for them to attend. Therefore, these projects are an important part of a student's school year because their purpose is to allow students to keep the information and experience that they have learned through their school year throughout the summer and to prepare them for their next year. However, even though these projects are needed and are useful to many students, are they currently effective in achieving their purpose? In order to achieve their purpose of cultivating students, summer projects should be student-designed because by having students design the projects, it can prevent student procrastination on these projects, allow students to gain more knowledge and understanding from these projects, and also motivate students to complete these projects. By appealing to students's interests and creativity, allowing students to learn more, and preventing their procrastination; to help future students, summer projects should be student-designed.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
39FCD9C9727F,"Even during the summer, learning new material is important for students so that they can maintain their knowledge. Therefore, requiring students to complete summer projects is a great way to allow them to keep learning even outside of school. However, these projects would be best if they were teacher-designed, rather than if they were student designed. This is because teachers would be able to provide the projects with more reliable information and content than students who most likely would not be very experienced in the content. Also, students may not put much effort into their projects if they designed it, in order to make it less difficult for themselves, whereas teachers would make sure to design the projects in a way that would allow the students to put in the effort to learn the content. Lastly, teachers would be able to make the projects both educating and entertaining in order to fit the students' desires.

Allowing teachers to design the summer projects for students would ensure that the students are provided with well-known and reliable content. For example, if the teacher were to design a math project with math problems or scenarios, it would most likely not have any mistakes and contain problems that the students would be able to solve. Whereas if the students were to design the projects that they didn't have much knowledge on, there would be a high chance that they may have made a mistake in the problems and as a result, affect their learning as well. Therefore, it would be less risky to allow these summer projects to be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are learning the right content that they need.

Many students would argue that summer break should not include any schoolwork, therefore, assigning them to create a summer project would only influence them to create a project that is not educational, which would not benefit them in learning the content. For instance, if the student were completely against doing any schoolwork over their summer break but were still assigned with designing a science project, they would most likely design the project to be effortless, so that they could get it done as fast as they could, and not teach them any content. In order to ensure that the student does put in the effort to actually learn the information, it would be more beneficial to give them teacher-designed projects, which would provide them with the right level of effort that they would need to put into their work.

In fact, a number of students do not even have much knowledge on how to create a well enough project that would best educate them. Therefore, teacher-designed projects would be able to suit the students' needs and provide them with information that would benefit them the most. In addition to this, teachers would be able to design the projects so that they could entertain the students as well as educate them. For example, the teacher could design a math game as a project, where the student could have fun playing the game as well as learn the math material. As a student just now learning the content, it would be best to have more experienced teachers create the projects in order to suit the students' level of knowledge on the specific content as well as their desire to be entertained.

As a result, summer projects should most definitely be teacher-designed, as it would be more reliable, educating and entertaining. In the long run, the students would be more likely to learn the content without any mistakes and have fun learning it as well. Even if there are still many students who absolutely object the idea of teacher-designed projects, it would be best for them to keep in mind that these projects would do more to help than hurt them in their later years of school. In addition, these projects would give those students a head start in their learning and be more beneficial to help them maintain their knowledge for the rest of their school years.         ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
0BDD43321AFD,"Remember in elementary school you used to get summer reading logs and checks on books you were 'required' to read during your break? Some students never had a problem with these types of assignments because they loved to read any chance they could get. Unfortunately, there were also the kids who would dread reading and give up after ten minutes or pretend they did the entire assignment. Though at this age, it really didn't matter whether or not you did the reading logs, it was just a little nudge your school would give you to do summer learning. However, when students reach higher levels of school, especially around high school, the requirement of summer projects is actually a requirement. Lots of students complain that it is unfair to do assignments over the one, long break they receive, but depending on the class subject it is for, sometimes these projects are essential. Schools must be aware that if summer projects are always going to be required, the assignments should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed because students will have more urge to do them and sometimes the projects can interfere with summer plans, making it troublesome to get work done.

Summer is the only substantially long break that students receive off of homework, assignments and tests. Through the months of August until June, school does not cease. Almost every week, robotic-like students must wake up early Monday morning, suffer through eight hours of sitting and listen to a teacher go on about something like, why did the War of 1812 happen, how to dissect a frog, or solve for x. Five days are filled with this repeating schedule with two days to spare, and in my experience one of those days is set aside for weekend homework. No matter how much someone loves school and learning, eventually they need a break. Summer is the time to cut loose, hang out with friends, travel somewhere you've never been before and relax. Almost everyone has seen in a movie how students throw their books and papers up in the air as soon as that last day bell rings. Imagine receiving a final project the last day of school, requiring students to turn in on the first day of their next year of school. Now if that project was teacher-designed it might require a student to: 'write an eight page essay on the effects of propaganda use in your society' or 'create a tri-fold and 3-D display of a past, indigenous, tribe's village'. Just picturing these assignments make some people cringe. However, if summer projects were student-designed, people could create a piece of work that interests them and hopefully enables them to put in more effort on the assignment because it wouldn't feel as much like a school task. Student-designed projects could focus on what students question or wonder about in their day to day lives, peaking their interests and making the task feel more fun and creative. Students could receive a broad outline like 'write an essay' or 'create a display', and turn it into a unique piece that expresses themselves; something like a paper on endangered animals.

During summer a lot of trips and vacations are taken whether with family or friends, near or far. Nevertheless, each one requires people to leave their homes and travel with the minimal amount necessary to save space. In my experience, I once was gone for almost the entire summer. One week I was in Pennsylvania with my relatives and the next I was swimming in the crystal clear waters of the Bahamas. Now imagine if these vacations, no matter how long the duration, were to be taken away from students because of a teacher-designed, summer project. If one was to receive a project of this type, there is no way of telling how much time or the location required to get it done. For example, if teachers were to design a summer research paper on the history of where you live, it might be necessary to go to the public library to view history records. No one can do that or go there if they're skiing all the way in Colorado. Student-designed projects allow students to create a work period and timing schedule for when doing the assignment works best for them. This way they can coordinate when their prior to summer planned vacations are being taken and when they will be home or around an area that will allow them to get work done. Students planning their projects and work time around summer could mean multiple things. For example, when they will be home to create a display, whether the hotel they stay at will have wifi to get on the internet, or even who they will be with to conduct an interview if the project requires that. A lot of the projects teachers design don't put into aspect all these factors.

Some, especially teachers, might argue that having students design their own summer projects will lead to the minimal work necessary and a poorly done assignment. Teachers might say that students are primarily focused on their summers and just having fun, rather than getting something done that could benefit them in their next school year. However, if the project is required for school, that typically means it is graded. Students won't try to do the least amount work possible just to save them time, if that means they will earn a D on the project. They will start the year off poorly. The overall effect of the project will outweigh how much time and effort is put into it.

Overall, student-designed projects would be more beneficial for both teachers and students because these types of assignments create a unique idea of who you are as a person because it shows individual interests. If a project was deemed boring and just based on facts, teachers would be more likely to receive non creative and possibly plagiarized work. Students wouldn't care to try their best because this one task is taking time out of their long awaited break from school. In addition, student-designed projects also allow teachers assigning them, to have a sense of who their incoming students are, based on their projects.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
10F4FEDEF052,"Giving students summer projects keeps their brains functioning. Some schools require that students complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These summer projects should be teacher-designed because they know the content, have more resources and have more experience.

All teachers know what content they will be teaching giving them an edge to designing summer projects for students. With an understanding of the content they will able to create projects that will be beneficial to the the students. Moreover, the teacher can plan summer projects that include information that the students will learn throughout the school giving the students a head start. For example, a math teacher might give his or her student a math related summer project which will cover topics that will be learn't in the upcoming school year. This makes the project something that will be helpful for the students and keeps their minds working. It will also make their school year easier since they've already learned some topics through the summer project.

Teachers also have more resources to be able to produce summer projects for students to keep them engaged. Many teachers attend workshops and meetings to learn about ways to make their lessons better. This gives them immense amounts of resources they could use to put together helpful summer projects. They also have connections to other teachers and programs that students don't have the access to. These connections are important since they provide useful information. With that said, teachers would produce better summer projects than students would.

Finally, teachers have more experience when it comes to designing projects. A big part of a teachers jobs is to create projects and worksheets for their students all year long. This gives them experience regrading what the students will enjoy and how to plan the projects. They would also know how to assure that the students are learning but in a fun way based off their experience. Teachers go through college to learn all this, so they have a lot of experience and a good understanding of what projects should entail.

However, some might say students should be able to design the summer projects because they are the ones that have to do it. It is true that students are the ones that have to complete the projects but the teachers know what will be better for the students to help benefit them. For example, a student might create a project where they have to play video games. This would not benefit the students in anyway since they will not be learning anything. Therefore, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they know the content, have more resources and have more experience to assure that students continue learning during their break. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
B59E34151E67,"Summer break is the time that students look forward to the most. After a long 9 months of continuous learning, it is a time in which they can take a much needed break. However, in this time of relaxation, many students abandon the idea of learning completely, which causes much of the knowledge that they have acquired throughout the school year to be forgotten, defeating the purpose of even learning in the first place. Summer projects counteract this phenomenon by forcing students to utilize their brain muscles in a productive way that is different than in the school environment, where teachers are in control of the assignments. Therefore, even though teacher-created projects are the norm, summer projects should be student-designed in order to allow students to better themselves to the fullest extent.

Although the assignments that are created by teachers are needed in the early stages of life, student-designed projects are necessary in the later years to keep students' minds stimulated as they get older, preparing them for adulthood. From the beginning of kindergarten to the end of 12th grade, structure and routine are drilled into students as part of their development. While it is necessary at the beginning of school life to set a foundation for growth, at a certain point, it goes from moving children forward to holding them back.

While a small child needs the structure a teacher provides in order to learn the basics of how to function in human society, adolescents need to be allowed to break some previously set boundaries to prepare them for their adult years, where everything they do will ultimately be up to them. So, giving students the opportunity to design their own assignments allows them to formulate behaviors and habits that they need now and will need in the future like time management, organization, and self sufficiency.

While teacher-made assignments are well structured, the absence of structure allows students to become more independent. The school system is set up in a way that stresses the importance of structure and consistency. However, a consequence of that focus is that students' natural inclinations are often stifled and they become dependent on said structure in everything they do. Being given strict instructions that have everything planned down to the very last detail causes students to become used to having the hard work done for them. But giving students an assignment in which every single idea must come from their own minds allows them to expand their mental capacity and limits greatly, by forcing them to tap into the ideas floating around in their mind that were previously suppressed by rigid school assignments and organize them into cohesive thoughts. This allows students to develop self study habits through self created projects, ultimately helping them in future situations, such as higher education, where most assignments are loosely structured and students are forced to rely on themselves to succeed.

Although teacher-designed assignments are very effective, student-designed projects keep students engaged by steering them away from the monotony of traditional school assignments. During the summer, students are often more focused on enjoying themselves than preparing for school. Having to complete a summer assignment may put a damper on students' spirits, making them feel as if they have to rush to finish their assignment in order to have fun. This can foster cheating as students can share answers between each other without learning anything, since they are not in school, which defeats the whole purpose of the assignment. Very often during the school year, students do the bare minimum on school assignments because they are too one note and don't allow them to express themselves. However, giving the students the opportunity to choose what they are learning about will make them more enthusiastic about doing a summer assignment and put more effort into their work, as it gives them a chance to showcase their creativity, originality, and what they are really passionate about.

While teacher-designed assignments provide the structure needed for students who aren't in school, they don't help students to the fullest possible extent. Therefore allowing students to design their own assignments fosters creativity, originality, and expands the limits of students' minds, as they are given the opportunity to take all of the ideas and innovations that are forced to stay in their minds during the school year and form them into a project that demonstrates the best of their abilities. Through this mental exhibition, they not only retain what have they learned throughout the school year, but they are also inclined to learn even more, because they have the freedom to learn what they want to.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
1FD55698D1E5,"Summer is already a time where students want a break from school and adding a summer assignment will make students less motivated to do it. If students are able to design their own summer projects they'll have more motivation, use their own creativity and avoid procrastination.

First, students tend to always procrastinate with a lot of homework assignments,especially over big breaks. This can lead to not doing an overall good job on a project, which can then lower students grades. When I was in my freshman year of high school, I had a summer assignment due by the first week of school. I had to read any book that my teacher had put on a list. The list was of super boring poetry books that I had nothing in common with. I had to pick a book so i finally picked this random book, Fly. I didnt want to read this book so I waited until the last week of summer break to read it. Little did I know that I had to write an essay, create a poster about the book and create a short film about it. I was up every night that week trying to complete it last minute. When I got to the first week of school I had received a 78 on the project. This was not the best I could of done, but because I waited last minute I got a low grade. If I had a book that I was interested in this would all of been avoided.

Next, creativity is something that people lack nowadays, they always rely on others to create something for them such as projects, work, etc. If students are challenged to use their own creative minds to create a project it will help them for the future when they need to do these things for jobs. I am someone who hates being told what to do and how to do something, so being able to design my own project will make me want to do it even more. I had a project that I got to design for my chorus class that I was in my sophomore year. I got to create a schedule for elementary school choirs, that was the topic I got to choose myself because it seemed interesting. I did my own research and found the perfect teaching plans for an elementary school choir class. It was such a good project because I was able to create exactly what I was passionate about, but it was still related to the class I was in. The elementary school across the street from my high school liked my ideas so much from my project that this year they use it for their lesson plans.

Lastly, students already have very little motivation to do anything in the summer time. All they want to do is have fun and not have to worry about school projects. Teachers expect us to want to do everything that they assign and thats not always true. If they want to keep students motivated and to do something well done, then teachers should have students do their own work. Forcing us to do something also makes students not motivated. In my sophomore year, I had a few teachers force us to do assignments that were very boring and it made me not motivated to do it at all. If I was able to design my project I would of been happier and not have felt forced to do it. I would of enjoyed working on the project and I would of done my best on it.

It is nice when teachers come up with ideas on assignments because then students will have deadlines to complete it by, its more organized and teachers dont have to worry about students going off topic, but having students pick what they want to do will make a better project overall because students will be more motivated to do it, turn it in on time, not procrastinate and use their own creativity inside of their summer projects.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
7DE9E964097A,"Would you prefer it if your summer project was teacher-designed or student-designed? Schools that require students to complete a summer project to make sure they continue learning, should have the teachers design the projects, because getting the teachers to choose what their students projects should be about, helps expand the students knowledge, it gives the teacher security that the students will do the project as expected and it also get the students out their own comfort zones.

First, schools that require students to complete a summer project, should have the teachers design the projects, because it will help expand the students knowledge. For example, if students know little to nothing on the topic given to them, they will discover facts they didn't even know existed. In addition, if the students discover interesting facts about the topic given them, it would encourage them to do some more research on the topic; therefore, expanding their knowledge even more than before.

Next, schools that require students to complete a summer project, should have the teachers design the projects, because it will give the teacher security that the students will do the project as expected. For example, if the students were to chose the way they design their projects, it would never get done because they'd procrastinate. However, we can't say for sure that the students will do their summer projects if the topics or the way it is designed is given to them, but we can say for sure it give the teacher the reassurance they need.

Finally, schools that require students to complete a summer project, should have the teachers design the projects, because it also will get the students out their own comfort zones. For example, if students were to chose the way their projects are made or what topic to make it about. It would be about something they have knowledge of, something thats within their comfort zone. Although, most students like to stay within their comfort zones, it's good to expand that comfort. You never know what you might find and catch of interest.

In conclusion, schools that require students to complete a summer project to make sure they continue learning during break, should require the teachers to design the projects because it helps the students expand their knowledge, gives the teacher security that the students will get their projects done during break, and last but not least, it gets the students out of their own comfort zones.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
A9FC7416BFC4,"During the summer, students want to play video games, hang out in the mall with their friends, relax at the pool, or just sit at home in their room and just be on their phones. The one thing students dislike is that schools expecting them to finish up a summer reading project or a math project. They do not like it at all. But, if the students play a part in planning some of those projects and it becomes student-designed, it may persuade the students to actually care about it and possibly build up a good study habit throughout the summer as well.

Student-designed summer projects should take over teacher-designed summer projects due to the fact that student would be interested in perfecting their skills in areas such as reading and writing, which in some cases, those are some of the areas where students struggle at coming back to school. In addition, the students may not feel obligated to do it. They may feel like they have to do this because the school made them do it over the summer to stay focus. If the project was student-designed, the student would feel like the teacher or school is hearing them out. Therefore, the student will do it because they had a piece of input in the project and the teacher/school would not have to worry about most of them not caring about the summer project.

The goal of a school is to ensure that the students are getting the education they need and to help get the students involved more in learning and by having a summer project that is student-designed it would put them one step closer to that goal. For example, if the students were able to help design the project for the summer, they technically still be helping to achieve the schools goal which is to get them ready over the summer.

In conclusion, student-designed projects should replace teachr designed projects because in the student-designed projects would help the students get invovled more during the summer and they would care about it more because they were apart of the process rather than teacher-designed projects which you have to do what the teacher wants you to do.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
2D97441646AF,"In early June of every year, students around the United States sigh in relief at the end of the school year. No longer trapped by stuffy classrooms and long extracurriculars, students have time to enjoy summer with their friends and family. But this summer is not a full vacation. Many students are required to prepare for their classes in the next year by completing at home summer projects in a variety of subjects. In deciding the design of such projects, summer projects should be teacher-designed in order to instill discipline among the children and improve the quality of education during the school year; while some may argue students will be more engaged if they can design the summer projects themselves, the freedom received by creating one's own project could actually leave students disinterested with a topic mattter they know little about.

Receiving teacher designed projects, and not giving students the freedom to design their own, will instill discipline among the children that is needed to be successful in the coming year. While it may be unfair to impose a project only decided by teachers, this unfairness is consistent with the method of which projects and tests are given out during the school year. A student who expects student autonomy in an advanced class with a lot of content may be fustrated and even resentful towards a teacher who tries to implement teacher-designed projects during the school year. Thus, students may not be disciplined enough to listen to their teachers and do what is expect of them if they have such a different mode of learning during the school year. Furthermore, it is especially important students understand and get used to the rigor of advanced classes such as Duel Enrollment and Advanced Placement classes, which put high demands on the students from the beginning to the end of a year. Difficult classes, like Advanced Placement, are often required to give out several tests and projects of a specific regulation or design, as per the exam that students are expected to take at the end of the year. Failing to model the specific design expected in the advanaced class would do a diservice to the students who are taking end of year exams, and may even lead to lower scores.

Most importantly, giving teachers control over summer project ensures that they know exactly how educated each student is on the subject matter and will not have to waste time repeating material that could have been taught during the summer. Student-designed summer projects will often veer towards a student studying a topic of their own choice; thus, their peformance on such a project will only give insight on their capabilities in that subject and leave the teacher clueless as to what else the student may or may not know. For example, a student-designed summer project in calculus may have the student practice and research taking a derivative. A teacher will be able to judge this student's abiity in differentiation. However, the teacher will have no understaning of the student's ability to integrate or sum series, which are two equally crucial concepts of calculus. By relying on the student to design his summer project and, by extension, his preparation for a class, the teacher will be ill informed on the actual strengths and weaknesses of his or her students. This will have adverse effects on the quality of education during the school year, because the teacher may waste time teaching concepts students need no help in and failing to spend more effort teaching concepts students overwhelmingly struggle in understanding. The quality of education may suffer in other areas as well if students were to design their summer projects. Since elementary school, I remember many teachers complaining about how summer is when students' education goes down the drain. Without the presence of teacher instruction or even projects to complete, students often fail to retain information of the previous school year. Consequentially, teachers gripe, for good reason, that they spend the first quarter of the new year reteaching old information. With teacher control over summer projects, students will be forced to renegage witth all the material the teacher expects them to know before returning to school. Students will not have such a large gap of instruction during the summer and, thus, will be able to learn more information at a deeper level during the school year, improving the quality of their education as a whole.

Others may argue that giving students autonomy over their summer projects will make them more engaged with the material for the school year, but too much freedom may lead to a lack of understanding and excerbate disinterest with the subject matter. A student required to make a project about introduction to world history will probably not know much about the subject during the summer; thus, he or she will be more likely to feel lost and anxious about having to create such project. The student may only research the topics he or she already understands, say American history, and neglect researching the roman empire or hundred years war that will make up most of the material in the class. Thus, the student has not grown in interest for the class, but has remained stagnant in both understanding and engagement with the new material of the year. Also, he or she may feel overwhelmed and cheat or simply turn in a project of bad quality in response to such a demanding project.

Instead of fostering engagement, throwing students into the deep end of a class with little teacher instruction may actually scare students from taking the class in the coming year.

Teacher-designed summer projects will provide the school the opporutunity to prepare students for their best chance of success in advanced classes and to teach students more information at a deeper level. These projects are schools' best hope in ensuring students do not sweat out all their knowledge in the summer heat. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
1BD5E6B368B8,"The summer project should be Teacher-designed because the teacher knows more about the subject than students do. the main reason why a summer project would be assigned is for students to continue their learning career during break. Most school projects are usually not hard but time consuming. They really help students to not forget about what they are learning about. In the summer time, students tend to take their whole mind off school because there is no work to do, but if they have a project to do, its easier to keep your mind on the subject your learning.

If the teacher was the creator of the project, it would be so much more straight forward and exactly on the topic that he or she was going for. The reason why it wouldn't be a good idea for a student to create the project is because it may not be what the teacher wants us to learn, for example, if we are going to read a summer book, and then write a summary on the book; the student can choose a book that: they already read, a very short book, or a book that has nothing to do with the topics they learned about. If the teacher assigned the book, She would let them read and study a book she thinks is best for what they learned over the year.

Another point about why teachers should be the one who designs the projects is because, They have more knowledge about the topic. For example, my history teacher gave us a project to do on world war II, and we had the choice to either create the project ourselves, or for the teacher to design it for us. We had one week to decide either or not we should design it or not, so we made a chart. The outcome of this chart should us that it would be best if the teacher designed it for us. The reasons for letting our teacher design for us was: the teacher is gonna be grading it so we want to know how to do it right, if we were the ones to design the project, and everyone in the class has a different subject, then it would be very confusing on the teacher to grade or talk about in class when we come back in the summer.

The only reason I feel like would be a better idea if the students designed the project is because it gives more creativity for the students. The problem about that is, the student can do the project the way the teacher does not want it to be made. I think the best way to handle this situation is if the teacher gave the students a specific topic and specific rules to the project. In that case the student can be creative but at the same time, the teacher would be able to grade it and talk about it in the class for everyone to listen, because everyone's project would be on the same subject.

In conclusion, the teacher should design the project because, it would give the student a better understanding on the subject that the class is learning about. Students would have a broader thought about what they learned about in that class. They would not forget about what they learned, and they would keep it in mind through out the whole year. It is honestly hard to remember everything you learned during the year, so summer projects are great for students, if the teacher was the one who designed it.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
5EFE548412A3,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

The schools are hopeful that students will retain information they have previously learned and review the concepts of the new material for the upcoming courses they will enter the next school year.

These projects have the option to be designed by the students or their teachers.

Teachers can assign a project to each student based on the course work in their classes, or students can choose a project to complete on a topic of their choice.

Projects which are required to be completed over summer break should solely be student-designed for the overall success of the students.

Student-designed projects completed during summer break will greatly help the student succeed and benefit more than teacher-designed projects.

Students who design their own projects will choose a topic that they are passionate and eager to learn more about.

When students are engaged in a topic, they will have a desire to excel, leading them towards success in the completion and quality of their projects.

When my cousin Generic_Name was in tenth grade, he had to complete a project for his science class.

Generic_Name hopes to become a meteorologist after he graduates college, and he loves to study the atmosphere and weather.

For his project, his teacher asked him to study common genetic disorders.

Generic_Name despised learning about genetics and waited to complete his project the day before it was due.

Generic_Name did not receive a good grade on his project and had to work extra hard the remainder of the year to pass his science class.

Generic_Name experience shows how student-designed projects benefit the student.

If he had been allowed to choose his own topic for his project, he would have been glad to complete a project so that he could learn more about the atmosphere and weather, a topic he finds appealing.

Therefore, student-designed projects are more beneficial because they provide ample learning for the students.

Unfortunately, opponents argue that teacher-designed projects will allow the students to fully learn the information that they need to know.

They insist that teachers know what information will be in their students classes and that students should adhere to the information within those courses.

Some even argue that teachers should assign projects to students based on the areas each student needs extra practice mastering.

However, student-designed projects have many benefits which greatly outweigh these concerns.

Opponents are worried that students will only do the bare minimum if they design their own projects.

This is definitely not the case, as proven by Generic_Name science project.

Students will not be willing to work hard or take enough time to properly complete a teacher-designed project that does not interest them when they are on their summer breaks.

Students will be eager to fully complete a project if they can choose their own topic.

Therefore, teacher-designed projects are not the best way for a student to learn.

In conclusion, student-designed projects are more beneficial than teacher-designed projects.

They provide the student to learn much more than they would if they had been assigned a specific project.

Student-designed projects allow the students show their passion and eagerness about a certain topic.

Teacher-designed projects are not beneficial to the student despite what opponents may argue.

They force the student to study a topic that the student does not have an interest in, causing the student to do poorly on the assignment.

Generic_Name teacher-designed project shows how students do not learn from being assigned a project but from being able to choose and discover one on their own.

Student-designed projects are obviously best way to continue learning during summer break.    ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
6937959572F0,"Summer is the only 3 months of the year that you dont have to wake up first thing in the morning and go to school. Summer is what every student is looking forward to. The thought of a 3 month break just keeps students pushing through the year, We work so hard during the school year, and finally, we get to relax during summer.

There is only one major problem with summer. Since it is over a extended period of time of 3 months, kids do not remember all the lessons and all the information that they had learned over the 9 months they were in school. Of course we still have the knowledge in our heads. We just need to be reminded, or do semi-frequent reviews on things you did during the school year. All of the important things with stay in your head if you remind it to not forget the things you have put in it.

Every student thinks differently and has different mind sets. Sometimes kids forget all of what they learned during the school year, just over 3 months. But when they are reminded of all of the things they had learned it is refreshed. But their just isnt enough time during the school year, to both refresh your brain from last years lessons, and teach you all of the lessons for this year.

There are a many of ways to solve this problem, but not everyone should have the same solution. Different students take a certain amount of time, and a certain amount of energy put into them. To keep all of the lessons from the previous year refreshed. The solution has to be found by the student not the teacher.

One option brought up by teachers, You must have homework over the summer. For example summer projects or review packets from the previous year. But, students should have a say on this, after all we have been slaving away for 9 months. All the students want is a break. But they will have the opportunity to either keep learning during the summer or just do these projects or packets as reviews so they are all caught up and ahead of the game for the upcoming school year.

After all it us the students break, They should be the ones deciding their projects. However much effort they want to put in, is how much they get out these projects. But these projects would keep you up to date and if you really wanted to you could go further and learn ahead.

If these projects were teacher based, It would feel as if you are still in school. Giving the student the freedom of creating and picking their own project makes then feel like they are doing these projects fun. Because some summer days can get very boring. These projects that the student either picked or created is helping them both learn more and review from the previous school year. They will not forget as much of the information they put so much time and effort into getting in their brain, they do not want to lose it.

It would be better if these ""summer projects"" were not projects but just seldom reviews. Just every one in a while go review or look over your old text books, that way you will not have to be reminded during the school year and waste time and effort. Just a couple times a week during the summer, you will be refreshed of all the things you learned that were in that text book.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
2FF01AA49B76,"Schools requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break isn't a bad idea, but should the projects assigned be teacher-designed or student-designed? I personally, as a student would much rather prefer a student-designed project over a teacher-designed project. A lot of benefits come from letting students design their own projects. The continuation of students learning during their break is in fact important, however, students should be given the option to design their own projects that they will enjoy constructing during their brake. Students including my self don't always tend to understand instructions given to us by a teacher, so, who would students go to if they were ever confused about a certain task that had to be done on the projects designed by their teachers?

Students designing their own summer projects benefits students, teachers, and schools. As students are designing their projects, teachers have now saved time. Teachers no longer have to take time out of their day to plan these projects for their students over the summer. Students are gaining knowledge by practicing their creativity, planning and organization. While students are constructing these projects they're always learning something new whether it's from the research the student did or the materials used, the point is, students are benefiting from these projects as well. Schools now have teachers with more time to make the school a better place by being prepared for when the students come back from break and they now have smarter and brighter students who've been learning new things over the summer.

Yes, It's true, a student would much rather prefer not doing ANY projects over the summer, but if they were given the option to do a project of their choice that they design, they will complete it and they would enjoy doing it. No one wants to have a boring summer break and if students are assigned projects they should be at least able to design there own so they can have fun completing them. You'd be surprise about how creative students can get and that's what makes it fun for students. Students have a variety of choices to design a project, like online projects, poster board projects, try fold projects, etc. Learning and having fun at the same time during their summer break doesn't sound too bad after all.

Who or where would a student go to if they had a question about one of their projects that was assigned and designed by their teachers? Yes, now a days we have technology that helps us communicate, but not all students can purchase a device or their parents/guardians can't afford to purchase their children an electronic device. A student designed project would prevent all of those problems. It saves busy parents' time from having to drive their children to the school to ask questions about the projects they were assigned over the summer. With a student-designed project students would be able to put all their ideas on their projects with out having any questions because they designed it.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
0F8DF7342EF8,"With my drooping eyes, aching head, and numbing hands I was unable to function in school due to endless nights of studying. I felt like I was an emotionless doll who only knew how to work and never stopped for a simple bathroom break. As teachers gave me more assignments, I thought I would never stop working like a factory worker in a large assembly line, doing the same action repeatedly. However, there came a time when I was able to take charge, thus, giving me the ability to breathe and take control. Although some may believe otherwise, summer projects should be student-designed because the project will be created to fit students' busy schedule and will give students a chance to create a project based on their interest.

Like all creatures, humans have a limited number of days before they die, causing humans to busy themselves to reach their goals before their inevitable death. By giving students the ability to create their own projects during the summer, they can produce a project that can accommodate to their busy summer schedule. For instance, last summer, I was gifted the chance to volunteer at summer camps, create outreach programs for my robotics club and travel with my youth group. I had a few days in the summer where nothing was planned and I could relax at home, but, those days were mostly spent working on my summer assignments; Even with my hard work, I was unsuccessful when trying to complete my summer assignments. By giving students the ability to create their summer project, students are able to adjust the time needed for their project so they can manage their time easily,especially teens with summer jobs. Another example is my cousin, Generic_Name, when he was in high school he struggled with his online summer projects because he traveled to China the entire summer, causing him to have no internet access to certain sites banned by China. When he came back to America, school had already started, causing him to be behind from everyone in his class. If students were to create the project, Generic_Name could have been given his assignment early and completed it before he went to China instead of having his teacher post the assignment during a certain time period in the summer. Moreover, giving students that ability to plan out their summer better and managing their time wisely.

Similar to food, humans need to feed their fiery passions in order for them to develop into leaders who enjoy their craft and work constantly to improve it. As young teens grow into adulthood they will produce their own aspirations, therefore, by having students create their summer project they will be able to base their projects based on their interests. Ludwig Van Beethoven, one of music's most prominent classical composer struggled in life because of his hearing loss, as a passionate musician, he did everything in his power to play music, even laying the piano down onto the floor so he could hear the notes. By constantly playing and composing, Beethoven was able to develop his music skills, later, making him an inspiration to all musicians. Similar to Beethoven, giving students the opportunity work on their interests by creating their own summer project, it will fulfill their passions and encourage students to follow their goals. My friend Generic_Name is passionate about programming and creating apps, however, this year he feels disinterested in computer science class, because it is not challenging enough for him. Therefore, making him doubt his love for computing and his goal to one day become a programmer for a large company. One day, he received an email from a small company asking him to participate in a project that would challenge his programming skills, helping Generic_Name reignite his love for programming. By giving students the ability to design their project they would be able to further study the subjects they love and eventually evolve that passion into a career.

Some may say that students are lazy and if they were to have control over their own summer projects they will produce easy projects that will not prepare them for the upcoming year. Since this generation have students who have access to devices that makes life too easy for them. While understandable if a project is designed by a student it does not mean the students themselves will be grading the project. Since students are designing their project, there is still a rubric to follow and a teacher to grade it, so students, fearing a terrible grade will give their full effort in achieving a high grade to start the year off. For instance, I was given the power to create my own project about a book I had read during the tenth grade. students were able to choose the way they wanted to present the book, letting students have the chance to procrastinate and use little energy for this project. But the teacher still graded the project, giving the lazy students low grades and the efficient ones a high grade. Moreover, students the chance to create their own work, they will create better projects that will show off their fruitful efforts.

Overall, students should have power over summer projects because by having the power to make one's own project young teens will get to have a small taste of freedom and independence. Helping future leaders learn to value the ideals of an individualistic society where they can help others gain the of justified freedom. Making the world more hopeful and happy, which is everyone's ultimate goal. Besides, this projects give anxious teens worrying about their future a chance for them make projects that could help their developing interest, helping them understand their purpose in life. Creating more passionate and independent workers that could impact the world by creating new technology or helping socially. So please, reflect and think about giving the today's youth some independence, so they can help make the future a brighter than before. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
76CDE9069DBE,"Summer projects are seen as a way to make sure that students are learning. These summer projects are usually teacher-designed. It is a valid opinion to believe that the projects should be teacher-designed. There are many reasons for the projects to be designed by teachers. The students could easily pick simplistic projects that do not give them any type of learning experience. Teachers know more about the topic and could give them different ways of learning. Lastly, students can easily forget to do something when they are responsible for the outline or design for an assignment that is usually given and made by a teacher.

Students over the summer usually want to save time for leisure activities. When the idea of school comes into the minds of these students, it can be seen as agitating. When you add the freedom to make your own project the way you want, there can be downsides for the student and the teacher. Since many students want to minimize stress during their break, they could easily make a project that makes the work appear as effortless. This effortless mindset usually produces work that is mediocre and possibly doesn't go into detail about what the project is about. This could anger teacher and make their assigned project appear to be pointless. The student's work would have no benefit to their grade or their opportunity to learn.

As a teacher, it should be necessary to keep your students focused on the topic that is at hand. Some teachers will even go out of their way to do this by giving a project over the summer. Many teachers give these projects to students with additional options designed by them. This is logical, due to the fact that a teacher knows a lot more about the topic of the project than the student. The job of the teacher is to find a way to make the information adhere to the student's mind. The teacher's perspective will give the student different ways to learn the material while keeping them interested and busy over the summer. In my experience, I found that I was more motivated to do a summer project and learn more about the material when I had different ways of learning it through the teacher's direction. When doing a summer reading project, I had read the book but found little interest in finding a way to incorporate my own creativity into the project. It was much easier to just read the directions given from the teacher and it also made me learn the theme and main topic of the book more adequately.

Responsibility is a necessary thing for students to have. But it is very common to find students overwhelmed with this new found freedom. Many people forget to do things when it is necessary for them to do it without guidelines or specific criteria they have to meet. Sometimes it's not that they forget, but that they are totally frustrated with the idea that they have no assistance on the project. This could be especially troubling over the summer as students are more focused on enjoying their break. The idea that they have to do something on their own without any prior information can be overlooked. When doing a project for a pre-IB class I found that it was easier to do when I had guild lines to measure up to and it wasn't just a time for me to implore on my creative talents in order to get something done.

Summer projects are something to make sure students keep learning over their break. It's clear to see that teacher-designed projects are much more efficient. Without the guidance of teachers, students could make simplistic projects that offer no benefit for the teacher or student. The teacher's knowledge about the project could make it helpful for their students to keep learning different ways about the material. It is also common for students to forget or lose interest when they are given too much responsibility for an assignment. Student-designed projects can leave room for a large quantity of errors and mistakes that could ultimately defeat the purpose of a project. Therefore, teacher- designed projects are better in the sense that they can keep the student learning as if they are still in school but give them time to enjoy the benefits that come with summer break.          ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
BAF3E4907368,"Summer projects should be student designed, because it's Summer break, most student's won't be doing work. They are most likely to be outside in the pool, at the park and playing sports. But because of that student's should be required to work on the project at least once a week every week until the due date of the project.

Working on a student designed project could be more beneficial and encourage creativity and inspire many great idea's. because during Summer break because during break student's have more time and more creativity and inspiration, especially when it's student designed, every project would be unique and different according to the type of summer the student had, If they had a happy fun, filled summer the project could be fun and playful but if the student had a layed back and chill summer the project could reflect that and being chilled and layed back.

It could also prevent cheating, and expose cheater's. As if two student's come back to school with the same project it's most likely they cheated. because whats most likely going to happen is the students who dont do any work will cheat and copy off of the students who took valuable time out of their summer. So student designed projects could eliminate the problem of cheating and copying.

In the end I find student designed project's are more better and more beneficial than teacher designed projects, as student projects are more creative and more inspiring for the student's.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
568CD1F277F9,"For students, summer tends to be a time of relaxation and laziness. No longer worried about waking up early to go to school or staying up late to finish homework, kids are free to do as they wish for about 2 months. Therefore, some students get annoyed when teachers assign projects over the summer, as they believe that they should not have to work at all during that time. The solution to this problem is not to remove summer learning entirely, though - it is important for the student to retain information over the summer so that they will not have to re-learn everything the following year. An ideal middle ground, therefore, would be letting the student design their own summer project. While teacher-designed summer projects would follow the curriculum of the school more, student-designed summer projects would be more ideal because they would give students the motivation to work on their own and foster the crucial skill of independence in them.

Having students create their own summer projects may increase their desire to work on it, as projects would be tailored to each student's individual interests. Children would be much more likely to work on an assignment if it is about something they are interested in, not something they are being forced to do. In addition, they could start thinking about their summer project before summer even arrives, rather than waiting for the teacher to come up with an assignment for them. This gives them more time to come up with ideas and work. Finally, each student spends their summer differently. Some older students are busy doing internships or college tours, while others are more free. Having students create their own projects based on their abilities (which students themselves have a good idea of) and personal time constraints would ensure that each student produces the best quality work that they can. Students would not feel like they are overwhelmed with work, because they are the ones who dictate how much work they have to do. A beneficial side effect of this is that while some students may be able to spend more time working on their project, it will give the teacher a general sense of each student's capabilities and time management skills.

Not only would student-made summer projects increase their desire to work, but it would also make them more independent, a necessary skill for all children but particularly for those in high school. Many students in high school would be preparing to go to college soon, and it is important that they learn how to be independent before they leave so that they are able to thrive in college, as they should. Students will not always have someone to create ""projects"" or learning experiences for them; college in particular makes students learn much of the material outside of class. Consistently giving students teacher-created projects and assignments throughout elementary, middle, and high school makes students believe that they only need to do what the teacher gives them to learn the material and pass the class. However, the same system does not apply in college - professors will not ""spoon-feed"" students information, they expect them to learn it on their own, however they are comfortable doing so. Giving students opportunities to increase their creativity and figure out how they learn best, even for something as small as a summer project, would ensure that they start becoming independent before it is necessary for them to have fully developed the skill. This would eventually lead to the student being able to succeed not only in college, but beyond, such as when they get a job.

While it is obvious that there are benefits to having summer projects be teacher-created, a major one being that it stays in line with the school curriculum, having student-created summer projects would give more long-term benefits by increasing a student's motivation to work and making them more independent. Teachers may be able to ensure that students follow a certain rubric or include certain information in their project, but the main job of a teacher is to make sure that a student learns. Today's school system has taken much of the joy out of learning by making students focus more on grades than the actual material being taught, and forcing them to learn to pass the tests instead of learning because they want to. Admittedly, there are some students who can only be taught through force, as they do not want to learn by themselves. For such students, it may be more beneficial to have them to teacher-created summer projects. Overall, however, having students design their summer projects may bring back the joy of learning in them, and making students want to learn is much more important than them getting a 10 out of 10 on a provided rubric. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
BEDC43C0FE6A,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects assure they keep learning during break. I believe that these projects should be teacher designed. It has many more benefits to be teacher designed than student designed. It would also be easier on the students than making them design their own project.

Firstly, it would be easier for the students to have a set criteria for the projects made by the teacher. If the students were to design the projects there would be more freedom, but also more room for error. the teacher designed projects would be easier to follow and help with getting the information they need to continue learning over summer break.

Furthermore, the assurance of the students continuation of learning over the summer is greatly increased. The teachers would be able to give the right information needed to do the projects. If the students were to design these projects it could not run as smoothly as it needs to; they could also get the wrong information.

However, if the projects were to be student design, there could be benefits to it. There would be lots of room for creativity and originality. The students might have a better sense of freedom on the projects and it could possibly make them work better. Also, being able to design it themselves could instill a greater passion for working on the project. The possibility of being original with the project design could also lead to a better assurance that the students will still learn over the summer.

In conclusion, the projects should be designed by the teachers. It gives better assurance to keep students learning. It also assures that they are getting the right information needed. It is also mainly easier on the students ability to do the project. The teacher designed projects provide the best assurance that the students have a continuation of learning over summer break.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
ED201C3D1F84,"Students are often given projects they don't like, but if they design them they could be a lot more drawn to work on them. Because is break, students shouldn't be working on a project they don't enjoy, they could choose to do a project about something they like. Summer projects should be student-designed, this would make the projects feel more personal.

If students could design their own projects they would be more motivated to work on them. I once was assigned a summer project about whales, a topic I'm not really interested in. I didn't really worked on the project during break and waited until the last week of break to work on it and didn't really do my best on it. If students choose to do their projects about a topic they are passionate about, they will be more motivated to learn more about the topic and work on the project.

Students should design a project they would feel confident doing. Everyone is different and every student is interested in a different topic. My sister was assigned a project about cooking, that is something she enjoys a lot, she finished the project the same day it was assigned. She already knew a lot about the topic but she learned more while doing the project and she felt confident doing it. Students could feel better doing a project about a topic they already know a little and want to learn more about.

The projects they would design would let them have fun and learn while doing the project. I usually have more fun doing projects about topics I like to learn about. I learn a lot more when I'm interested in what my project is about. Usually people learn more when they are having fun because that makes them more interested in the topic. Because is summer break students should be given the chance to have fun instead of having to work on projects about topics they don't really care about.

Having students learn during their break is important, but break is meant to have fun and relax. A project students can have fun doing is what every student would choose. If we let students do more projects about subjects they are passionate about they will be a lot more interested in doing them and will learn a lot more.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4

A teacher's job in the workplace is to give students knowledge on things they must know and help them with their next step in life. Their next step could be; college, applying for a job, help writing a resume, applying for a college, looking for a major, etc. After a long 9 months of school, some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure learning over the break. If students are required to complete a summer project, it must be student-designed because it introduces themselves, helps students discover their interest, and develops creativity.

Summer projects should be student-designed to introduce themselves to their teachers the following school year. Martin Luther King Jr. created a "" I had a dream...""

speech that explained his struggle with racism and segregation. M.L.K. Jr. wrote and executed the speech in front of a live audience on his own, later making him the leader of the civil rights movement. The speech gave him a name worldwide, everyone knew ""Martin Luther King Jr.""

During the holocaust time period, a young Jew, Ann Frank kept a diary for people of the future so they knew what happened to all the Jews who were killed by the Germans. Her diary is now a famous book and in the Holocaust Museum in D.C. Ann Frank's diary was written herself, before that she was just one of many Jews, but because of her words, everyone know's who she is. A student-designed project would set up a teacher idea for how much their students know and help them to learn about their students.

Students developing a project on their own develops creativity. Albert Einstein is known as one of the smartest people in the world. He created a robot, Frankenstein. Einstein blocked out others, used his own knowledge, got creative, and made history on his own. Helen Keller was born with the default of not being able to hear or to see. This was a tragedy, making it hard for Keller to walk and successfully know where she was going. Growing up with this issue she became extremely smart and used her problem, got creative, and began helping others by tutoring people who are deaf and blind. If students created their own projects it would give them an opportunity to come up with something incredible using what they, causing them to be creative, and generate ideas

Students are in school receiving teacher-designed projects all year. On a students summer break, they should at least be able to create a project that interest them. Many young kids, between 3-7, try many different sports like; soccer, basketball, dance, gymnastics, baseball, cheer leading, flag football, etc. parents enroll their kids in different things so they can discover their interest young and stick to what does interest them to improve. Many high schools have electives to chose from as an extra class for students to find their interest. If teachers picked the elective classes for the students there is a good chance the student would not enjoy the class, destroying the point of an elective. By letting students branch out and selecting things that they enjoy could create an amazing project.

Students wait all year for their three month summer break. Most schools dont require a summer project, however, some schools do. Over break there should be no project but if required give students the opportunity to design their own. This could not only benefit the students, but the teachers as well. A student-designed project would introduce students to their teachers, giving the teachers an idea of what the student does and does not know. It would cause students to brainstorm and come up with creative projects and help student's to find what interest them.

7001C733FC64,"A lot of people argue that in school, the teachers know best and not the students. This has led many people to believe that summer school projects should be teacher-designed and not student-designed. Summer school projects should be student-designed because teaching methods evolve with each generation and it gives the student more confidence.

An efficient teaching system would change the way it teaches in response to newer and smarter generations. For example, when computers were becoming common in the 80's and 90's, many schools adapted to using them to better teach their students. This made teaching much faster for both the teachers and the students. Because the students back then demanded change, almost every school in America now has computers in it.

Students would be much more confident if they knew the assignment was designed by another student. One example is the SOL's tests in the state of Virginia. Many students would find it more convenient if the questions on the test were more modern or relatable and made by someone closer to their age. Applying this to every test would significantly boost student performance. Also, there is a popular saying that goes, ""Great minds think alike."" Students minds are more sharp than most teachers minds, therefore resulting in a more efficient assignment design system. Furthermore, this leaves the students with less stress, easing the massive load of pressure that modern schools apply on them.

From a constant wave of smarter, brighter generations of students to just simple confidence; this is why summer school assignments should be student-designed and not teacher-designed. If we stick with old methods, no one will succeed into the future.                        ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
31FFFAFD3987,"Summer projects should be teacher designed. And for a multitude of reasons. But a couple of these reasons are Student designed projects wouldn't be challenging at all because they'd make them for their own conveinience if they'd even design one, and also the teachers know what is going to be taught in the future for the class so they can accurately design the project to cater to that, and the students can't.

I'm a student and I know if I was ever given the opportunity to design my own summer project I'd try to make it as easy possible, and I know many of my fellow classmates would try to do the same. It's just how teenagers think matter of fact it's how most people think. If you can design your own work for yourself why make it harder for yourself that's just simple logic. In class students often say things like "" If I was in charge there'd be no school"" or "" If I could make the test I would make evry question 1 + 1"". Comments like these that I hear everyday in class are exactly why students can't be responsible for making they're own assignments, because they won't learn. Some of my friends are always looking for the easy way out of things and I presume that their are other kids out there like them so them designing their own work wouldn't work. I feel that kids should think this way simply becaus we're kids and this is how our brain works. This is a very important reason for why kids can't can't design summer projects it wouldn't make tham any smarter because they'd be designing the projects to their own convenience.

Teachers know what they are going to teach in that year the lesson plan for the entire year is provided to them by the state. The student's do not, they're there to learn and to learn only. So the idea that the students would design a project is absolutely ludacris! Why would they do what their parents pay the teachers to do through tax money? If the students made the projects the projects wouldn't help them at all because they'd have no idea what they'd be learning and the idea that they'd know what their learning because they're in that class gets thrown out the window because its a summer project, only the teacher knows what's taught in that upcoming year. I think students should focus on learning and teachers should focus on teaching their shouldn't be any sort of role reversal because that just complicates things. Also teachers are their to teach the students it clearly states that in their job description. Having students design their own work just clearly sets them up to fail because they don't have the knowledge to know what knowledge they need to gain in order to be succesful.

On the other hand I can see how people could have an argument for why kids designing their own summer projects could be a good thing. Students know what goes on in their minds and what certain work they need to address specific issues. Essentially they know themselves better than teachers do, and them designing their own project could cater to their specific needs and problems. Also a few of my friends have told me that when their teacher lets them design their own projects and assignments they feel like they know and understand the material better. In addition studets designing their own projects could mean less backlash for the schools incase parents get mad about summer projects being too hard, because the students in that school designed that project not the teachers.

In conclusion students should not design their own projects because if it were left up to them they wouldn't learn anything and the project wouldn't be serious, and students don't know what is being taught in the class so they don't have the capacity to create their own work. This shouldn't even be a real question because it's very obvious that students shouldn't be designing their own projects they are there to learn from the professional which is the teacher not try and be the professionals themselves.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
8E536E1B7AFE,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? I think it should be teacher-designed because they came up with this idea so, they should have some designs thought of another reason why i think it should be teacher designed is that teachers have more experince of doing projects then students so, they should have alot of examples of projects for students to do and the last reason is students are on summer break if the students have to think of design to do they probably will forget or not do it but if a teacher gives them the design of the project to do they will do it quick and then enjoy there summer break.

Firstly, the teachers came up with this idea of giving students a summer project so, they can contine learning durning their break they should have some designs for the students for their projects. For example, my brother and I work at kroger and when we are off work our job still want us to be good citizens so they sign us up to feed the homeless and bring clothes to the shelters. Our job want my brother and i be good citizens at all times so, they gives us examples how to show them that we are good citizens.

Secondly, teachers have more experince then students at projects so, they should have designs thought of for students. For example, my father was a boyscout member for 5 years and he know how to make different types of toy cars so, i had a project at school i had to design a toy car and my dad had experince at toy cars so he gave me alot of designs to do and i did the easiest one. People who have experince can help the other person who doesn't have no experinceat at all.

Lastly, it is summer break students don't think about school if the students have to think of a design to do they will not do it but if the teacher give them a design for the project the students will do it quick for they can enjoy there sumer break. For example, Im a student at Generic_School if we had to design a project on summer break and i had to come with a design it would not have been done because we on summer break i don't think about school but if a teacher gives me a design i will to do it on first day of summer so, i don't have worry about the project trust me alot of students think a like so they will do the same some students don't even do home work and you think they will do a summer project.

The teacher should design the project because they came up with idea so,they should have some designs, they have more experince then students at projects so they should have alot of designs to share, students are on summer break if they have to come up with a design they will not do it. If we had to this at my school nobody will do it because we don't think about work whatever school does this is a bad school.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
8182360CC270,"Lest be real to ourselves, when teachers assigned students to complete a summer project, the majority will end up leaving it to a side and they will prefer to focus in other activities that they may have fun. Why? But why not?. The idea of students designed their own summer projects is valid because it will be less stressful for them and it will assure that the student complete it.

First, its a real fact that students dont like school at all; since they start students cant wait for their next break, so give them more work to do during their break will end up making them feel a lot of stress that can affect their social, personal or educative life. But, if they had the a chance to select their own projects, it can become a fun or interesting assignment for them because it will be of their choice.

Students usually believe that the majority of what they can learn at school is not even important for the real world; so students decide to just not complete the work teachers assigned and they start doing what they think its better for them. But if schools allowed students to designed their summer projects, it will make sure that they can focus more on what its real important for them; and it will be a joyful feeling for students to finish their assignment that they made.

Finally, students when they're during summer break, they're really focusing on personal goals and having some joyful time. By letting them to designed their own summer projects will assure that its completed and it will be less mental stress for them. However, teachers have to make sure that those summer projects will be teaching them the correct things.       ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
AE6DBB2AE6DB,"Summer projects are beneficial for learning. Students should design their own projects over the summer because they have time, can work with friends, and are educated about the subject. Some state that teachers should design the project because they have more experience and better planning, but this is false. Although some may disagree, students should design their own projects over the summer.

There are many reasons why this decisions should be made. Students manage their time in the summer differently making the designing process easier. They can use information they've learned previously in the school year when designing the project, helping the students gain time management skills. They can also choose their own topic allowing them to be informed of what they're designing. When a student picks a topic they enjoy, the final product will display a large amount of effort and dedication

There are further reasons why students should be able to design their own projects. Students get help from their friends who generate ideas for the students designing the project. Friends also help better the bonds they from with the students while spending time designing the project. Students can get help from their family member who help educate them, teach them new tactics, and purchase necessary materials required that the students cant afford. Lastly, students can go online to locate sources they can use to gather information while designing; furthermore, the students can locate articles provided by verified authors.

When students design their own project , they are in control. They gain skills through designing with the help from friends, family, and the internet. Students who design their own project gain skills they will forever use.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
3992F89490E9,"A big issue in the school system is the question as to how to keep students working their brains over summer break. Many students find themselves or their peers to be stuggling with their work when they return to school in the Fall. A great number of schools have found success in assigning projects for each student to complete throughtout their break to ensure children to excercise their brains. The debate over summer projects is whether the assignment would be more beneficial if it were designed by teachers or the students themselves. Summer projects should be student-designed in order to provide oppertunities for creativity and independent studies, contibuting to important life skills.

Allowing students to design a project specific to their interests encourages the student to express a creative process. The initial task of choosing a project requires the student to get creative with their resources based on what they find interesting. This process is critial to forming skills such as decision making and reasoning. Creating the project itself provides multiple levels of creativity and self expression for the student. Without a general project outline, the student will have to come up with ideas completely personal and relevant to themself. With the wide variation of projects produced from peer to peer, little input from other students will affect each others work. Enabling the students to set focus on topics and presentations personal to themselves sets the class up fo success by introducing crutial skills of creativity and hardwork.

Student-designed projects will put students in a position to work and study independently, providing skills for future education and career paths. Many projects in the workplace consist of due dates in the future, leaving the employee responsible for time management and execution of the project. It is the responsibility of the employee or student to choose a project reasonable for time provided and work required. Projects that are student-designed will help form these skills so students can maximize them later in their careers. A student-designed project will allow students to work and study independently, leaving them solely responsible for their research and production of their project. Learning at a younger age to be acountable for their assignments will benefit the work ethic of the students in the future. While it may be a concern that students would choose a project too simple for their skill level or without much hark work behind it, a set of standards from a rubric could guide the students in the right direction to complete a challenging project on their own and gain important life skills through it.

Assigning students student-designed projects will benefit students by encouraging hard work, creativity, and life skills. It is important to give students the option for independent and self designed work to push students to use their skills and succeed in future oppertunities of education and career paths. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
ADE4DD8CF781,"On an uneventful summer morning, I sat on my couch without having the intention to do anything; it was over one-hundred degrees outside, and my usual rounds of video games had gotten stale. My summer project, which I have been ignoring since summer break started, began taunting me from across the room. ""What does it mean by 'Student-Designed Summer Project'? It would have been better if the teacher just gave us a pre-planned project,"" I pondered. Teachers should assign summer projects with the intention of creating the rubric and grading them to a curriculum; this ensures that summer projects promote learning, stay structured, and provide educational overlap.

When schools require student to complete projects over the summer, they do this with the intention that it will promote learning outside of school; this prevents complacency and maintains a steady work ethic in students. I exemplify this because although I procrastinate until the last week of summer to complete my project, the sudden workload prepares me for the assignments that school will begin to assign when summer break ends. The project, designed by teachers, ensures that, as a student, I will be able to learn the intended learning target and apply it in the classroom and other learning environments. Although it can be argued that summer projects have no real application to the learning process, that reasoning, however, is flawed. This can be proved by the knowledge that summer projects are a valuable lesson that even without school, there will always be work that has to be done throughout the year, regardless of the season.

More often than not, teachers plan their classes and projects ahead of time to ensure that everything is structured properly which will allow teaching and curriculum standards to be met with ease. More often than not, summer projects that teachers design will always have a solid learning and work structure. However, in the case of student designed summer projects, there will be great flaws in the process of completing their projects. Similarly to how structure is vital to a project, it is also vital for building and construction. In the 1980s various railways in the mountain were built on uneven and crumbling ground. Furthermore, upon having a weak base, the supports, which were made of wood at the time, couldn't handle the trains traveling with a full load of coal and raw materials. Although the argument is weak, some may say that projects can be completed without proper structure. More often than not, designing and completing a project without a properly throughout structure can lead to confusion and the inability to complete said project. Furthermore, projects are required to be structured properly to full test the capabilities of the student.

Learning will always use co-requisite and pre-requisite knowledge in a process known as educational overlap; teacher designed summer projects are a perfect example of the various applications educational overlap can be used for. Throughout elementary school, I have been assigned summer reading projects made by the teacher that were to be turned in on the first day of school after break. I used skills that I learned in class before summer break and applied the skills that I had learned in the comprehension portion of that project to my English classes throughout the years. Some may say that teacher based summer projects don't provide educational overlap because during the summer break, not all kids may remember the lessons taught in school. However, this can be refuted with the fact that teachers design the summer projects to reinforce previously taught lessons and apply new ways of comprehension that students will be able to understand and apply in educational situations.

The ability to recall previously learned knowledge prior to summer break, maintain a structured learning path, and the ability to learn new knowledge are skills obtained and mastered through summer projects designed by teachers. By being able to complete a project made by a teacher, away from a learning environment, students can take their abilities to be able to continue learning. Furthermore, students can hope to use their skills in out-of-school applications such as careers that require hard work and dedication.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0

Summer projects should be designed by teachers because, teachers know what students need to keep on learning during the summer. After the school year finishes most teachers know what project they are going to give their students, because they know what students need to keep on learning to do better. Also teachers can see during the school year what students are struggling with. Teachers can make the projects about things they didnt get or if they were struggling with it. Teachers can give the same project that they have already given to students who haven't don it yet. Also teachers can make the summer projects more fun for the students by making it about something they liked doing during class. For students to keep on learning teachers can make a project for the things they are going to learn next school year.

Summer projects should be designed by teachers because, teachers can help each other make the projects more better for the student. Some teachers help each other make the summer projects more funner for students. They can help each other and see if theres something that all students did not get. Teachers can combined all there projects to make one project that is really good for students. Some teachers give the same project so students can learn it and do it together with there friends during the summer, Also students that have different classes can still do it even if there not in the same class. Teachers know what kind of project students like doing during the summer, and know what projects they don't like doing.

Summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have past experience in making projects. They know what they should put in a project, so the student can get a one hundred for there grade. Teachers know how to make a project more enjoyable for students like putting the things they like doing during the school year in the project. Teachers have already made projects for other students, They could give the same project but change it a little each year. Most teachers make projects during the school year then they give it during the summer. Also teachers can give projects they couldn't do during the school year. teachers could make a old project better and improve it for the students to do in the summer.

ADBC6A551DAA,"During the summer many learning institutions enforce mandatory summer projects over the break to assure that students continue to obtain the knowledge and essentials needed to succeed for the following school year. These summer projects should be teacher-designed opposed to student-designed. A student-design will disregard the necessary requirements and create a more fun and easy based project. Students are more likely to hold the project with minimum standards. While Teacher-design will assure that all criteria for the upcoming school year have been met, while still allowing students to enjoy their summer vacation.

A Teacher will make sure that all of the following requirements are properly met. A teacher-design will benefit the student moreover a student-design because it has been constructed by a teacher who is either teaching the course or has previously taught it in the past. A student-design will lack the accurate general concepts needed to help a student succeed. Throughout the school year students learn many new things that are forgotten by end of the school year. Although, teachers always manage to provide the best studying tools and guides. Which help students review and understand the information once again. In addition, teachers are experts at providing a variety of different learning styles that help students gain a complete understanding of the information. Especially in preparing them for more difficult courses like advanced classes. A student-design will be difficult to understand because the students wont have a full concept since they havent taken the classes before and wont know what is needed for the upcoming year

A teacher- design will be held with higher standards but still keep the project simple. Students will be held accountable for actually completing the assignments correctly. A student design will have many possible errors, will not be taken seriously, and will not grasp on the important concepts that are needed to be obtained. Students are more likely to take the project more serious if their are stricter requirements and guidelines. A

teacher- design makes more sense because

Students learn information best from the teacher rather than their peers. Teachers are better at preparing things like project and are able to provide students with better understanding. Teachers are able to adjust and plan accordingly to each individuals learning pace. overall, Providing a a student with a teacher-design will help the students know what the expectations are for the next school year and prepare them efficiently during the summer break.

In conclusion, a teacher will guarantee that the student is absolutely prepared for the next school year by helping the student to obtain the appropriate knowledge needed to successful in the specific class the next school year.

C2AF2867B85F,"As soon as the school year ends, the first thing that comes to every student's mind is the relaxation of summer. Summer is filled with fun events like going to the beach, hanging out with friends, and sitting by the campfire. What does not come to a student's mind is the project they were assigned over summer break. However much they may hate it, a project is a smart idea to ensure their intellectual learning continues over the extended break. With the natural dislike of summer projects, a way to make sure that students complete this project is to allow the students to design it. A student-designed project would be better than a teacher-designed project because students know how much they can handle, and it would allow the students to further their own interests and work on it on their own time.

Allowing a student-designed project would be more beneficial for students because they know how much they can handle. One thing that students struggle with over the school year is constant stress and the workload of classes. Coupled with extracurriculars, eating, and sleeping, there is not an abundant amount of time left for the students. As such, students have to be extra organized in order to make time for every activity. Because they are able to do this, letting students design their own project would assure that the students do not have an overbearing workload all summer long. A teachers schedule is much different than their students; so if a teacher designed their project, they would not be able to accurately plan according to how much each student could bear. Summer break is also supposed to act as a break from school, thus students should not be put over the same stress during summer break as they are during the school year. The only way to ensure this is to let the students design their projects.

Student-designed projects would entice students to further their own interests. If teachers designed the project, they might focus it on a certain subject or topic, but this topic might not always interest each student. Therefore, a student-designed project could be taken in any which way. Sophomores in high school are already starting to stress about where they want to go to college and what they intend to do for work after college. There is no better way to help ease this stress than to let the students design the project. Students could first focus the project on a subject or area of intellectual learning that they prefer and then take it from there. If a student aspires to be a lawyer when they grow up, then maybe they should design their project around the most influential lawyers in history. If a student hopes to be a marine biologist, then maybe they can design their project so as to analyze marine life on a local scale. Some may argue that this would enable students to pick topics not related to anything in school, but any subject can enhance the knowledge of a student. Even if the student is interested in video games, they could still complete a project on the mental effects of violent video games. Allowing students to give the project their own twist will make the project more favorable among students, and will encourage them to complete and put effort into the project.

Finally, summer projects should be student-designed because it will allow students to work on their own time. Summer vacation is always the perfect time to travel to other countries or just new places within the United States. Although, some of these places often do not have internet, or are hard to complete work in. If the summer projects are teacher-designed, then the project deadlines might interfere with travel, or aspects of the project may be impossible to complete while traveling. If students designed the project, then that would allow them to plan around vacations and also focus topics to where they are traveling. If a student is traveling to Spain and has an interest in Spanish history and horses, then they could complete a project on the influences of the Spanish Riding School of Sienna. This aspect of the project also helps to reduce the stress of students, because they would not have the constant worry of meeting project deadlines or requirements. The opposite side would argue that this would enable students to procrastinate on work, and not put in enough effort into the project. But, allowing students to design their own project would instead peak their interests, so they would feel encouraged to put effort into the project.

Summer projects can often be a pain, but allowing a student-designed project would take away this pain and maintain the values of fun and relaxation all summer long. Student-designed projects would be more beneficial than teacher-designed projects because students know how much they can handle, which would allow them to increase their knowledge on a topic they are interested in, and to adjust to their personal schedule. With the rapidly changing society today, the school system must change accordingly. The archaic, strict project guidelines of the past must be amended to further childrens' academic success in the real world.   ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
9C72A7F166C3,"In many states schools require students to complete a project over summer break. these projects should be teacher-designed because if students designed the project nothing will be beneficial for them, students could possibly make it not very challenging, and students would not have enough information to make a project.

If students designed the summer project it could possibly be nonbenificial to the student. for example, during the summer there are lots of actvites to do, lots of places to go, and lots of free time. students' time are occupied with hanging out,that the least thing on their mind is designing a project. if students design the project their will be a lack of information in the project, the project might not meet the requirements that the school would prefer.

if students design the project it could not be very challenging and very small because the students dont want all their time occupied by school. some may argue that if s student designs the project that it can possibly have the information that the students possibly don't know, but that is very unlikely because it is students' free time, no students wants to have work piled up to take their summer away.

Having a teacher design the project is much more beneficial for the students because the teacher have grades of test they have taken, giving the teachers a broad idea of what information should be on the project. Teachers know exactly what to require on the project, as well as what key points to make sure they go over so when the next school year starts,students' brains will already be soaking up information throughout that summer. it won't be new to them when the school year starts. usually without any project or learning tools set in pace during the summer, students brains will practically lose a majority of the information from the previous year, it is very important to have your brain always functioning as well as feeding it more information daily.

If students were to design the project, they could possibly not have the correct information on it, or just not enough information. one students education level should not be applied to the project because every students can know a little more, or know a little less of a subject and could use the practice. teachers should be required to design the project so it can be beneficial to the student, it can be a little challenging, just enough to get your brain functioning and really thinking, and so all the information provided is from a broad understanding of all the students weak spots, as well as their stronger spots. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

During the summer we all have receive some sort of project or assignment that would be due during the first week of school. However, the projects are always assigned by teachers on what they think that is best for us. Not all students are pleased with the fact that we have to do work during the break. Considering that they just went to school for almost ten months and still have teachers think about what the students should do during summer break it's not fair. In my opinion I think that teachers should let students choose their own summer projects because they can have fun while making the project, turn the project however they like into something creative and have them be motivated. Summer is the time to not stress about assignments that are complicated. Instead it should have the student be interesting to have something to do so they can remember the memories they made while making the project.

Summer time is the time where students can be stress-free and just have fun with friends and family. Including the fun activities they enjoy doing. That should be the main idea of a summer project because letting students decide how they want to do their own projects will keep them motivated on doing it because they can express their creative minds onto something they know they won't get judged on. For example, Most people even without having to do a school project, majority of teenagers want to document their summer to show everybody what they did, to remember the amazing sunsets or sunrises throughout summer or the cool places they went too and family events that happened. As well with trying new thing that you didn't think you would enjoy but by the help of thee summer project you made , you learned a lot more about yourself. Either by the help of a friend or by just finding new activities that interested you by reading it or by seeing a commercial. Students want to share every detail of it because it was something they experienced during those two months that made them happy and not feel over whelmed with stress that was over their heads because of a boring assignment their previous teacher assigned them before school ended.

In addition, while students are making the project they can work individually. Some may feel more motivated to think outside of the box on what your whole topic should be or how they can make it happen. However, with a group project you can work with friends make it even more adventurous. Some students may think differently instead of going out they can make an invention or make something from scratch, the possibilities are endless because it would be up to the student to create something unique that teachers may not have thought of before.

When teachers design projects sometimes it isn't the type of projects that we all expect. You can't really be creative because majority of the time they will give you a template of the important things you should actually do and it just gets rid of the fun of doing the project because you're only doing what it is asking you to do. As well with having teachers design the project it wouldn't make much sense because you passed all your classes as well with the grade you just passed. During the summer you don't have any teachers that you're enrolled in yet in their class. That's the main reason why I think it shouldn't be up to the teachers to design and have the students instead .

In conclusion, I strongly think that summer projects should be student-designed rather than having teachers designed the project because summer is the time where even if you're a teacher student, principle. It is your summer and your own experience. You should at least as a student have the control of what you're own summer project should be about during your summer break because it is where you mostly spend time with family and friends just enjoy everybody's time. Also it helps you think in many ways on how you can make your summer the best one yet by doing many activities or starting new hobbies just because of this project and learn yourself at most by just having fun. A project doesn't have to be boring, you just have to find what interests you and what helps you keep motivated.

A1BA626DFD42,"Many students tend to forget things they learned at school, in the summer. During summer, teenagers are out having fun and taking a break from school. Although the school year is over, students should not lose focus on what is important. Since teens need to keep focus, a summer project would be the perfect task for them. Summer projects should be designed by their up coming teacher because students will get familiarized with what they will learn, teachers will assign projects that will be beneficial to their students, and teachers will have a criteria showing students what to look for.

To begin with, going into a new school year, no one really knows what the year will be like. Having a summer project allows students to have some knowledge on what the new year might bring. For example, if Generic_School made students do one summer project it would not only help their grade for the first quarter, but also show them know what they will learn. Although there will be students who will not do the projects, there will also be people who will complete them because they are serious and focused on school. Students who work hard and want to be successful in life will see that summer projects given to them will be beneficial to them.

Additionally, teachers know what is best for their students. A prime example here at Generic_School is a geometry teacher, although she assigns a handful of work, she knows that if the students completes it, it will be extremely helpful to them. Most of time students will complain about the amount of work a teacher might give them but in the long run it will help them tremendously. Teachers giving out projects to do in the summer may sound dreadful but it will, undoubtedly help them. To add on teachers will always tell students what to look for and give them a rubric to help them.

As a matter of fact, teachers will never assign a student a project and not give them a rubric. Often times, students will argue and pout about a project, but when a teacher gives their students a rubric and the criteria of the project, it makes it twice as much easier. Students who are serious about school and want to bring up their GPA will not complain about one measly summer project. Also, summer projects will never be too hard, since the school year has not yet started. Teachers will most likely tell their students what to do and how to do it. Even though the projects assigned to students may be easy, some may complain about the subject and want to do a project on a subject they choose.

While some students may prefer to do a summer project on what they want. The pros to this would be that they are actually interested in the subject and more motivated about it. They would also, most likely get a better grade on something they are genuinely concerned about. For example, if a student loved the ocean, they would be more excited doing a project on marine life or how unique the ocean is than doing a project about different rocks. Although this may be true, teacher-designed projects would be more beneficial than a student choosing their own subject.

To conclude, teacher-designed projects would be more productive for students than student-designed projects. It gives students the opportunity to learn a little before the school year starts. Teachers will assign students projects that will be helpful to them. Also, the projects would not be extremely hard because the teacher is essentially telling students how to complete the project. Schools should allow teachers to assign the students projects to do in the summer because it will help them a great deal more than students choosing their own projects.                 ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
B09064197CEF,"Why is education so important for our generation and the many generations to come? Education has a major role in helping students become more aware and understanding of the world. Students study hard all year long and work on assignments that help them develop many different skills, as well as assignments that will help them gain more knowledge as they get older. In order for schools to help students maintain their learning habits, so that they come back to school prepared, they give out projects for students to work on during the summer. Now the question here is, should the schools hand out teacher-designed projects or student-designed projects? Schools that require summer projects should allow the projects to be student-designed as it lets the students showcase their creative abilities and it is more manageable than a teacher-designed project.

Firstly, a student-designed project will help the students gain creative intelligence. Nowadays, many students do not like being forced to do assignments or projects that they have no interest in. It can cause them to lose focus and do poorly on the project/assignment. To have the ability to implement their own ideas and thoughts into a project would be way more efficient than a project where the students get little to no creative freedom. For example, if a student is extremely interested in music, they can use what they are passionate about and create a song for his/her summer project. This project will enhance the student's knowledge on music and let them have a chance to build their skills while having a good time. Since it is also something they like to do, the student will put more effort into it unlike a teacher-designed project where they will be less motivated to do a good job. Moreover, for students who do not usually explore their creative side, the student-designed project will be a great opportunity for them to be able to improve in that area. So through research and their own abilities, many students will learn new things about themselves that they did not know before. Overall, creativity is key to good projects and with student-designed projects comes creative freedom, which interests students way more than a normal project would.

Secondly, student-designed projects are more manageable. During the summer, many students tend to go on vacations. If the school a student was attending, was to give out a teacher-designed project for the summer and the place the student went on a trip to, did not have the tools needed to complete the project, then everything would be a total disaster. Teacher-designed projects can sometimes be too specific in what they want which can be hard to deal with during the summer. If it was a student-designed project then the student could work with what they have instead of being stuck in the middle of a crisis. Additionally, students have better time management with student-designed projects. Since the project is purely based off of the students interests, they will be more motivated to do the project on time and not the night before school begins (which is what many teacher-designed projects lead to). Student-designed projects have more flexibility and uniqueness than teacher-designed projects.

Lastly, some people may argue that a teacher-designed project would be better because it keep students from doing a project that is too easy or a project that makes no sense. Actually, a student-designed project is more difficult than it seems. Through a teacher-designed project, students are given rules and specific directions for their project that will help them focus on the research of about only one topic, but as for student-designed projects there is so many topics you can choose from that it can be difficult to come up with the main idea for your project. So no, it is not as easy as some may think and requires just as much effort (maybe even more) as a teacher-designed project. Furthermore, the claim that through a student-designed project, ""students might create projects that make no sense"", can also be said about teacher-designed projects. A student who is given a project from their teacher can also turn in their project and it can make no sense. So overall, student-designed projects are just as challenging as teacher-designed projects.

To provide students with a period of time to reflect and build on their own ideas is how we can make them become more engaged in education. Through the school year, students receive enough assignments that are teacher-designed, so to break out of this tradition and try something new will definitely help students develop new skills. This is also very beneficial for teachers who have to grade the projects because instead of looking through different projects that all have similar main ideas or topics, they will be looking at all types of topics and won't get bored of grading the same things over and over again. Student-designed projects help students gain creative intelligence, are more interesting to students, are easier to manage, and can be just as challenging as teacher-designed projects. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
F7CB662CA783,"Over the summer, some schools require students to complete one summer project to keep their brains active and continue learning during the break. Teachers have the ability to assign their students what their project should be. However, it can be argued that students should be the ones that get to choose their topic for the summer project. Students should be able to pick their own summer project because they get to share what they are passionate about, have more control over the process, learn how to be self reliant.

Students should be able to pick a topic based on their interests instead of a teacher assigned topic. Students will have a better attitude and work ethic if they can do a project that reflects and shares what they are passionate about. They will also show more dedication and time put into their projects because students will care to make sure the information is accurate and not misrepresented. Students will be more proud of the work and research they have accomplished for a project that they choose and find appealing instead of a topic from a teachers choosing.

If students are given the ability to choose their own topic, they will have more control over their process and what they want to research. For example, students can start out with something as simple as a bottle rocket and decide what they want to do with it. They could do a project on fuel types or materials and have control over what they want to use or discover. This could also help students to easily restart a new project of they are have difficulty researching their current topic. In contrast, if students are having problems with teacher picked topics, they have to figure out how to do the project some other way and do not have the ability to switch. Allowing students to pick their topic is better so students have more control over their project.

When students are required to pick their topic, they will not only learn how to take responsibility for their work, but will also learn how to meet a deadline by doing a little bit of work every day in order to receive a good grade. Students also will learn self reliance and work on their own if every student picks an individual topic. If teachers pick students topics, there is the possibility of students copying others work that may have the same topics. If students choose their own topics, they will learn to become self reliant by showing their own work and findings.

The biggest downside to students picking their own topic is that teachers grading summer projects or presentation may not understand the work or topic from a project the student has dedicated the summer to. If teachers picked the topic for students to focus on, they would have prior knowledge of the topic and know that students can successfully complete the project from other students that might. But this could be avoided by having students submit their topic online over the summer so teachers know what they can do to be prepared. Students can then meet with three or four teachers, one of which could be someone with some prior knowledge of the topic, and students can go more in depth into their project. Teachers can ask questions making it more like a discussion that the student can lead instead of a student presenting to a class of their peers.

If schools assign summer projects, students should be the ones who select their research topic so that they will be more excited and eager to share what they have learned, they will have more control over the management of their project, and they will learn to take responsibility for their work. Overall, students will take more pride in work they have done if they choose what they want to research.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9114D5C32D36,"Summer projects are projects that teachers give to students so that they can continue to learn over the break. These projects can be later turn in for a grade that following school year. Certain schools require student to complete these for programs that students are in. Some students may have difficulties with these projects based on how they're designed while others have ease. Summer projects should be teacher-designed and not student-designed because of equal opportunities, it aids students to be prepared for their next school year, and its another way to assess growth.

First, summer projects should be teacher-designed to ensure that students get equal opportunities. Having students designed their own projects limits equal opportunities to get a good grades. For example, one student may have difficulties designing their own project than another student.

With projects being teacher-designed, teachers can help students with the guidelines of the projects. It also ensured that students get graded fairly. Since they are teacher-designed, teachers know what mistakes to look out for so that the students get they grades they deserve.

Next, projects being teacher-designed aids students to be prepared for the next school year. If the students design their projects than they are not being prepared. They prepared the student for next year by challenging the student in the project. Projects foreshadow to the students what to expect the next school year. They don't only prepared to the students, they prepared the teachers also. By these projects being teacher-designed, other teachers can see what the student know and don't know and plan according to their scores. Being prepared for next year gets rid of anxiety for the teacher and for the student and makes it easier for both the student and teacher.

Lastly, it's another way to assess growth. With teacher-designed projects, the projects would be similar to a post-test. They can judge if a student learn anything over the course of a school year. During the school year, teachers see all the mistakes and errors students make. By making these projects student-designed, there isn't a way to know if they student excelled or not. This also ties in helping teachers be prepared to go over the topics that students were struggling on so that they can finally pass that topic.

equal opportunities, growth tracker and student aid are some reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed. in the end, student should able to have equal opportunities to achieve good scores. Teacher-designed projects aid in preparation for the school year. By making projects teacher-designed, teacher have another way to track growth. Schools should adopt this so that students can be comfortable and have ease in the future.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
129C5DED720B,"Summer projects, we all hate them but have to do them at some point. There is no getting around it, so why not design them better? Summer projects are becoming more and more common but a lot of students have concerns about their break being over loaded with work. Is it still considered a break when you have to do home work every night for a solid period of time? I think summer projects should be student designed so teachers do not assign too much work, Also its a good use of students time to design and complete a summer project.

I think summer projects should be student designed so teachers do not assign too much work over break. If a project is made by students they will make it as simple as can be while also having all the requirements to still learn the information properly. There should not be anything wrong with having a project with the minimum amount of work needed to still learn the topic. Sometimes teachers create projects without realizing how much work must be done to complete the project. If the project was student created with teacher approval a lot of issues would be solved. Student designed projects that have been approved by a teacher will make the work load go down while the students learn the same information. This is all because the project was designed by someone with relatively the same amount of knowledge of the topic.

In my opinion summer projects should be student designed because its a wise use of time to have students create and then later complete a project. Students will learn a lot when designing a project because they must know what the project is on. Creating a project will teach them the info needed to complete the project so they will learn the information and have it stick in their minds too. The students would be able to complete the work reletivley fast because of the fact that they designed the work themselves. I dont see a problem with getting work done faster do you? Having student designing projects for peers to complete a great use of time because students will learn while creating the project. They will also get the work done quicker since they created the assignment.

An opponent of my view might say that a student created project would be made too easy for the class. A flaw that I can immediately point out in this argument is a teacher would have to approve the student made project before assigning it. A teacher would never approve of a project that didnt make the students actually work. While this opposing view makes sense there is a way to make sure the work load is appropriate. I think that teachers should have a strict set of guide lines for the project the students are designing.

Summer assignments should be created by students in an effort to make sure students do not work too hard while on summer break. It's also a good use of time for students when they create their ow assignments. The time it takes to complete the work will go down while the amount learned will grow. Summer vacation is a precious time and should not be spoiled by large and work heavy projects. more schools should consider student designed summer projects, its a smart idea.         ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
B89F37555A14,"Students tend to forget the curricular over the long period of not being at school. I would understand because my middle school required everyone to be assign on either projects/assignments over summer, to assure our learning. Having the teacher design the summer project is better then having students design them for many reasons. Teachers know what to put into the summer project and know that the students would use their knowledge to complete the assignment.

Teachers have the ability to acquire the knowledge that they teach to their students and assign the projects to the students' understanding. I have done a summer project in middle school just so I would not forget my studies. Plus, to maintain their knowledge it would have been school related, in order to continue their learning process. It would make the student feel at ease when coming back to school.

Students would have forgotten the subjects over the summer break by the time they start school again. Knowing that they would, requiring them to complete a summer project is appropriate. From my experience, I know that in math they start to review a little of the course that I took last year to prepare me for the math that I would take this year. To be ready for the next curricular, students need to review themselves over break to know the basic understanding of what the other subject is going to build off on. Which is the reason on having the teachers to create the project base on the subjects that they learned throughout the course.

Although having to work on a project over summer can be a positive outcome, there are negative outcome with it. The project that the teachers would make, can be boring and students do not want to have a summer project to ruin their summer break. I would have given up and procrastinate whenever there is a project assign to me over break. If the student design the project it would not very educational, they would not know what to do on the project. Having a teacher-designed project is important to their education and to the school. Their lack of understanding of creating a summer project that has to be important to their electives and their learning.

In conclusion, having the teacher to design a summer project is purely out of knowledge within the curricular that they teach to the students themselves. Keeping up with the students' education is important to boast their confidence to the next subject. The students would understand the requirement of their project if the teacher created the project instead of the students. Acquiring the course throughout the summer break would help with their next subject and obtaining a recall on the course.        ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
D39D282DE3FE,"The three warmest months of the year are considered as time off from school for students in the U.S and other countries. Even though these students aren't in school, they are still required to learn during their break. However, in many schools, the students are assigned a boring, uneventful activity that they feel as if they have no choice but to do. Reasons such as this are why students should be able to design their own summer projects; these tasks that they create for themselves can be used as an outlet for creativity, show signs of independence, and they can be used as a way of teaching responsibility.

One reason students should be able to design their own summer assignments is that they can be used as creative outlets. Many private performance arts schools require that their students create an art piece that corresponds with their fields of study. For example, photography and art students are told that they are to paint, photograph, design, etc anything they wish over break; that they have complete say in what they do. But, whatever work that they submit will be entered into their school portfolio (which is a collection of a students or artists best work). Being given free range of what they can do gives the student the chance to be as creative as they can be. And in many cases such as these, the pieces that the students are able to be the most creative on are some of their best work.

Another reason students should be able to create their own summer projects is because it can a be sign of independence. Being given an assignment and being told that they have to do it in a specific way can be boring to a teenager, especially one going through their rebellious phase. Yet, if a teenager were given the chance to make their own choices, it would give them the opportunity to test their indepencence. Such as being able to choose what they get to do for their project and how they decide to do it. This small, simple opportunity can show a student what it's like to test themselves and have complete control over what they do instead of being told.

Finally, students would benefit from designing their own summer break assignments because of the responsibility that it would ensue. Summer break is thought of as a time for fun and relaxation for just about all students, especially high schoolers. So the idea of being assigned piles of homework or a large project can cause a student to either want to shutdown or just completely avoid it all together. However, if a student were able to choose what they do for their work, in many cases, it will cause them to actually want to do it. It can make the student stop and think about what they have to work on, and then they will (typically) either stop what theyr'e doing to work on it, or they will set aside a certain time that they'll do it. The thought of ""oh, I have to go do my work"" will cross their mind because they actually want to do it, then causing them to make their work a priority.

Now, it is well know that many students need the structure that comes along with the teacher-designed projects because it can be harder for some to come up with ideas, but more often than not, that is not the case. Students leave school for three months just to be loaded down with extra homework; saying that they have no choice but to do it will either cause a teenager to go stir crazy, or they become extremely unmotivated to do any of it at all. However, if given the chance to make their own decisions on how to do their project, a student would feel more motivated to do the work because it's their choice on what's being done. All in all, it would be more beneficial for students to create their own projects rather than a mandetory, teacher-designed one due to the sheer facts that it would be a way for students to be more creative, it would give the students the chance to be more independent, and finally, it can be a way to teach students how to be more responsible.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
C1D049335CC0,"The final bell rings as students come flying out the school doors pushing and shoving each other to be the first one on their bus, school is out and the halls are left empty, just when people start to relax at home they remember about the summer project that has to be finished by the time school is back in session. school projects can be a pain, but they do serve a purpose. Teachers require students to complete this summer project to assure they dont loose the knowledge they learned throughout the year and to also assure they continue to learn throughout their break. Summer projects should be student-designed because it gives the student freedom, shows the knowledge of the student, and lets the project vary from student to student.

Summer projects can give students the freedom to do whatever they see fit and show how they can be creative. Students like to have freedom and will put more effort into something where they can choose what to do rather than have the same project assigned to everyone where creativeness is not a product. Students have to complete the work assigned to them in school which is already lacking creativity, teachers should give the students freedom in this summer project and have the student leave the school with a positive outlook. Every day student complain about the lack of freedom school already has, leaving them to be tempted by the things they cannot have.

Schools want to know that the students are keeping their minds fresh with knowledge and over the summer they give them a project to be completed by the time they come back. Having these projects be student-designed can not only be creative but also show what the student knows and remembers. Students can present what they know and how much they continued to learn by the projects they choose to do. The summer projects can also tell a teacher what topic they need to work more on with the students, and is very helpful in doing so.

Students can choose what they want to show and how they want to show it, whether if it is an essay, interview, or a project that have to build, with the ideas being limitless one students project cannot be the same as another, with each project having a unique difference. students can fallow their own rules and go the places their mind takes them. With the projects being different and varying,coming in all shapes and forms, the student can choose what they want to do and what they are be able to do. With the projects being different it can be easier to tell if a student copied another students work, where as if all the projects were kept the same it can not be easy to tell if someone copied another work.

Some teacher may argue and say that a teacher-designed project may be better, but a student-designed project can outbalance the good in a teacher-designed project. Rather that telling us what we need to Know students should be able to show just how much they actually know, some student can look up the information then forget about it because it is something that they are being graded for and have to include it in the project to get the best grade they can achieve. This also helps prepare the student for next year by showing them what they need to work more on and better themselves so the can enter the next year without any problems.

In conclusion schools and teachers should let students design their own summer projects because it gives more freedom to the student, gives teachers a sense of the students knowledge, and gives the project variation. The final bell rings as all the students are let out, but one thing remains hanging over their shoulders, a summer project.    ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
880EFB9368DA,"There is the argument whether student-designed projects or teacher-designed projects during academic breaks are better. When a teacher designs a project, it many times will not be feisable for a student going on a far-away vacation, enjoyable to the student's personal interests, or about what the student would like to study. Projects that students design can indulge into a subject they enjoy. Students learn better when they are studying something they love or relate to more. Simply having to design their own project will insure the student does their best work because they're studying something they love.

Generic_Name was given the oppotunity over her break to write a research paper on anything she wanted to spend the two weeks researching! Since she was at the beach and loved watching the seagulls swoop for cheese poofs and hop around, she wanted to learn more about them and write her paper on them. Generic_Name spent all of the time she devoted to her project outside, under an umbrella, watching the seagulls while she wrote! This allowed her to put in her own first hand observations of the actions of the silly birds! Generic_Name scored a 97 on her paper and she was praised for her first hand acounts of their actions and behaviors. Had she been given a research project designed by a teacher on something else, like Gandi or Italy, she wouldn't have connected with the topic in the same way, and would've been miserable the whole time writing it.

Generic_Name was tasked with bringing back a project ona different culture after his break, but his parents sprung on him they were going on a cruise and he wouldn't be allowed to take his laptop with him. Since the paper was due the day he got back, he had no choice but to spend the days before his trip in his room, on his computer writing to get it all done before he left. He had no time to spend with his friends and had to cancel plans because of this. His teacher, while grading the essay, noted there were many spelling errors and it seemed ""very rushed,"" and ended up giving him only a 73 for the project. Had he been given the oppotunity to design his own project, he would've had more time to enjoy his break and could've worked on it on the cruise, allowing him to keep his plans and spend time with his friends. The poor grade he recieved was just a slap in the face after the stress he'd been under about it.

Generic_Name was tasked by her teacher to write about the process of learning and to gain a new skill over the break, but she had to come up with a schedule on how to learn it, and pick what she wanted to learn. Generic_Name had always wanted to learn the piano, so she picked just that. She did research online about how long it takes to learn the piano, and signed up for an online course. Her goal was to be able to play a simple song by the end of the break. For the project, she tracked her progress in a journal, wrote about why she was learning different skills in the order she was, and how it was helping her understand. Finally, at the end of the break, she recorded herself playing a piece slightly harder than she originally expected, and submitted that with her project. Her teacher was so proud she played the recording for the class and everyone clapped! This student designed project definetly ensured she continued larning, and she ended up finding a new passion because of it; something that likely wouldn't happen if she was simply given a project to complete by her teacher.

Not all students are like Generic_Name though, and some need more structure. Generic_Name was one such student. He was given the topic of writing about an event in history and how it effected the world today, and how its effects have effected his own life. Generic_Name's probelm was that he had no clue how to relate history to his own life, and because of the lack of other guidance on it, he spent a lot of time sitting at his desk, staring at an empty Google Doc. When it came time to submit his project, Generic_Name only had a poorly written introduction and first paragraph. He quickly scribbled out two more, but they were riddled with errors, poor punctuation, and mistypes. He submitted the essay, and when he got back to school, he saw a 49 in red pen with the words ""See Me"" writen under it. He just needed more stucture and directions. A student designed project was not for Generic_Name.

CF6ED3973EDC,"Statistics show that when teachers help students one on one they are more likely to recieve better standards on school work then when teachers do not work with students. Many people believe that summer projects are un-necessary because students work all school year and now it's their summer break. Although, in reality, summer projects help keep students in a working mindset and helps them stay dedicated to school. Summer projects should be designed by the teachers themselves because this gives the students insight on the teacher's style of instructing, it maintains equal opportunities to all students, it keeps the structure of a standardized school project.

To begin with, as a student, being familiar with the teaching style of your instructors is a very necessary component to doing well in certain classes. All teachers have a differnet style of teaching; depending on the way they feel comfortable conducting their lessons. However, not all students may be able to adapt to the style of a specific teacher. By assigning a teacher-designed summer assignment, this gives students the opportunity to take a quick glance at the way specific teachers conduct their lessons. This allows students to not only be ahead but also prepared at the start of the school year, knowing how their instructor assigns work.

Furthermore, teacher-designed summer assignments maintain an equal opportunity to all students. This means, all students will be assigned the same project by the same teachers. Sometimes when students work together they may not be able to completely agree, meaning when they create a summer assignment; some students may not like the project and its format. However, if the assignment is created by the teachers themselves, it means the students can't question eachother, but only rely on the teachers abilities.

Additionally, throughout the school year teachers will assign projects to students using not only school-wide but their own standards. If the summer projects assigned to students were created by the teachers themselves, the project will maintain this standard implemented by both the school board and staff. Unlike students, teachers have plenty of experience when it comes to educating young adults. Due to the experince teachers have in their field of study, they can create a better, more structured assignment using their personal views and insights on the subject. Many people may say that if the project was student-designed then the students could relate to the project more or the project would be more understandable. However, the students may accidentally cut corners when creating the project anf be held accountable. When teachers design the summer assignment, it maintains a well-rounded format and is also related to the lessons throughout the acedmic year.

In conclusion, summer projects keep students in a working mindset and helps them stay dedicated to school. Projects that are created and assigned by the teachers are more reliable knowing the assignment has a standardized structure and will contain all the details in conducting the project. Allthough students may want to create a project they can easily complete due to the fact they created it, the project may not have all of the details it needs and will not contain the format implemented by the staff themselves. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
49CC6192468C,"Summer projects are frowned upon by many students across the U.S, but why are they even assigned in the first place? They provide us with material to review and they also give us the opportunity to get something under our belt that we may have had complications with during the school year. Lately, an astounding amount of students believe that these project should be 'student designed' instead of ' teacher designed'. this means that these projects that help students review certain materials before the schools year start would be designed by the students and not the teacher. 'Teacher-designed' projects allow the students to review past material and to work on skills/subjects that they were struggling with.

Teachers design these projects so their students can study all of the material, not just the the things that were simple and easy to complete. Having the students work on material that was taught during the year allows them to keep the information in their heads, so they won't forget things such as: how to solve for x when 2x+4=0 or what a fault line is. Every student will have the material in their heads so when they come back to school they wont be struggling to pass.

'Teacher-designed' projects also allows students that are struggling with a certain piece of material to review it, work on it, and try to learn said piece. Every student across the Earth has at least one or two things that they struggle with during the year. Having teachers design the summer projects allows them to add in those specific points, so the students that are having trouble will have a chance to work on it. This also allows them to not have to struggle to pass in the up coming school year, if they do happen to take advantage of it.

Students believe that they will be given too much work to complete resulting in them not being able to enjoy their summer. Now, if they would work on the project little by little everyday or every other day then they would get the assignment completed that way the could enjoy their summer without a care in the world. Most students decide to do the work last minute causing them to be stressed and get a low grade, due to the fact that they were rushing to get it completed by a certain time. they also believe if that if the students designed to project they could get it done quickly by only dded material that they know and that they are comfortable with, but what are they really getting out if it? Maybe. their whole summer to goof off and a decent grade when they go back to school? they wont the same opportunity of reviewing material if it was like this. causing them to struggle and possibly fail.

Students mainly focus on getting the project done instead of focusing on what they need to learn or know by the fall. Teachers dont give us work to be mean, they give us this work because they want us to pass and so we have to correct material to move on in our young adult lives. Projects give us the chance to show what we know and give us a chance to go over the things we know and what we should know.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
F038426B8B5A,"Some Schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Projects are used to enhance learning in a different way. During the summer no student wants to work on school work or even think about school. I think that summer projects should be teacher- designed because students may take a while to come up with a project or idea, teacher- designed projects are already made and ready to go, Projects would be less confusing when made by the teacher themselves.

One reason I think that summer projects should be teacher-designed is because students may take a while to come up with ideas for the project or put it off. Students are in school at least 8 to 9 months or for some students all year around, so when it comes to summer break students are ready to relax, go on vacation, or just sleep. Students already have done tons of projects for classes or even just for one class and those projects are very stressful for some. Summer in a lot of cases are relax time and forget about school time so when they are given a project to do a lot would just put it to the side and dont do it at all. When coming up with ideas on what to do some will not know or just not even try that's why it think it should be teacher-base.

Another reason that summer projects should be teacher-based is that teacher-based projects are already made in advance and are ready to go during summer and all the students have to do is follow the instructions of the project itself. If students are given the instructions and already know the idea it makes it a little easier to get done over the summer. Students tend to procrastinate and take their time, which they should, but that time may be at the last minute. It could be August and they have to go back to school that following week and haven't even came up with an idea yet. Teacher-based projects already have the idea and the instructions on how to do it and it saves time depending on the project. Students can still not do it at all but at least they have the foundation on what to do and start it and have it done with in weeks or days.

Furthermore, Teacher- based projects may be less confusing then when a student comes up with it from the top of their head. Students already dont want to do the project in the first place so the idea may be very confusing to other students or the teacher. If the project is a group project the idea may not be understood fully and may get taking the wrong way. Students school brains are already shut down so when to making ideas students tend to wing it and just throw it out especially when it is a group project. They think that the other is just going to figure it out on their own and that may not be the case or they leave each other hanging. Teacher- based projects make it easier because the idea and instructions are already there and all the students have to do is just follow them.

However, Teacher-based projects do have a downside to them. Teachers, of course, have been teaching and assigning projects all year and some are easy and some are not. Projects that are given by the teacher have to be completed by the instructions given and if it is not completed that way or in that way all that hard work just went down the drain. Student- based project do make it easier because it is their idea, their instructions, and their own way. So all that hard work doesn't have to go the drain for nothing. Student-based projects can be more creative because it is made from scratch and from their own head. Teacher-based projects are usually less creative because students are just trying to finish it and get it over with. In contrast, students may take a lot of time or wait till the last minute.

In conclusion, Teacher- based projects or student based projects can all be very good projects. Summer projects can be challenging because the summer is relaxing time, even though all of adults think otherwise, but summer projects do keep the brain fresh. I think that summer projects should be teacher based because it makes it easier on them and the students. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
4AB461F16BAA,"Summer can either be the best time of the year or the worst. With a mixture of the heat, mosquitoes, and stress about the new coming school year, summer has its troubles. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to show learning is being done outside of school. The debate occurs with deciding if the projects should be student or teacher designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows for creativity, one learns time management, and one can exercise self-reliance.

One reason why summer projects should be student-designed is that it allows for creativity. Without strict guidelines, students can produce original content. This will make grading better for teachers because they see a variety of projects. Creativity is important to a student because it will make the project more interesting. Students like to make a project their own and will overall put in a substantial amount of effort when they can be creative. One can easily see how student-designed projects allow for creativity.

Another reason why summer projects should be student-designed is that one learns time management. A student learns time management because they have a set period of time to create their projects. Students will have the ability to manage when they start their projects and can decide when the time is best for them. When students learn time management it helps them prepare for life outside of school as well as build character. It can be concluded that student-designed projects allow one to learn time management.

The final reason why summer projects should be student-designed is that one can exercise self reliance. When a student creates their own project, they rely fully on themselves. Self-reliance is a skill that can only be gained by practicing. This is a great skill to have because one will need it in the future. It is beneficial to start learning how to be self reliant as soon as possible. While creating summer projects, one can clearly see that students gain the important life skill of self-reliance.

Some people may think summer projects should be teacher-designed because it prevents confusion, but if students have questions they can easily email their teacher. Because one can be creative, learns time management, and exercises self-reliance, summer projects should be student-designed. The next time you meet with a school teacher, talk to them about how important it is to get students involved in creating their own projects. Without student-designed projects, students would be miserable and hate their summer. Make a change in the community around you for the better, and improve students lives for generations. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
503DA2534877,"Just because it is summer break does not mean kids should stop learning. Some schools have required summer projects to ensure this learning continues. One issue they have come across when doing this is should these projects be student or teacher-designed? Summer projects should be student-designed because some students have limited time, allowing them to design it will create more motivation to do it, and it is their time off to relax.

Summer may be a break from school but this does not mean that all students have completely unlimited time.

Many students hold a job over the summer in order to save or just get money. Allowing for student-design enables students to ensure that they have the ability to complete the project even if they are working. Finding a work and school life balance can be hard, but allowing students to have a little control can help ensure that they can find that balance. Summer is the time of the year where many people go on vacation. Students going on vacation should be able to enjoy family or friend time without stressing over the project. Student-design is going to help them know that they can complete the project without hassle or worry. Having projects be student-designed helps students with limited time manage the learning alongside their work or vacation time.

Motivation makes the task at hand a lot easier compared to when someone is unmotivated. Motivation is a big factor when it comes to a workload. If projects are student designed this will create motivation for them to complete it. Having the projects fit what the students want is helpful in making sure the project is reaching completion. Designing their own projects in comparison to the teachers designing it helps ensure that the student is actually interested in it and will truly learn from the experience. Learning is a daily part of everyones life. Students having a choice in a school system where almost everything is designed for them by someone else is a welcome change. Having this choice of what the project should be is going to increase motivation greatly.

Summer is a time of relaxation. Summer break is specifically for students and faculty to have time off from the stressful school year. Students should be able to relax since they have worked so hard the whole year. Designing their own projects is a way to enable them to be stress-free due to them choosing the concept of the project. Stress plays a big role in an individuals happiness. Having time to de-stress is hugely important for anyone, not just students. Choosing what they want their project to be is going to create a more relaxing summer for students so they feel they can reach completion. Having time off is very important for students.

When it comes to summer projects student-design is the way to go. Allowing students to create their projects will make life a lot easier for the students while still ensuring they receive some sort of education while on summer break. In conclusion, the summer projects should be student designed because some students have limited time due to work or vacation, giving them the creative freedom to design it is going to help with motivation, and last but not least it is their much needed time to relax.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
8DA0993625FF,"In most countries students are required to go to school for ten month every year until they graduate. As a current student i know school can be really stressful,sometimes it can be more than we can handle.

students should be able to relax and do some other things over the summer,but they should also be ready for the upcoming year. Teachers should always be the ones to choose the summer projects. Because most of the time students tend to take the easy way out,but teachers know what the student should prepare for and they know how to push the students out of there comfort zone and experience new things.

Most of the time teachers know what there student needs, some students are doing good in there classes and some students can be having a hard time so if teachers are the ones choosing the summer assigmenst they would be able to help the students having a hard time by giving them more work for practice,and giving work to the ones that are doing good to make sure they keep on doing good.

Students tend to get lazy over the summer if they dont travel,get a job,volunteer,e. t. c they should have something that will get them out of bed and excercise there mind,if they sleep and watch movies all summer they will have a hard time adjusting to waking up early and doing things the next school year.

Teachers should always know when its enough,students have a life besides school they should always give them a medium amount of work so it can be equale not a lot where it takes them all summer to do and not to small where they can finish it the first week of there summer break. ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
066F06E5E52C,"Summer can be a time for students to have fun and enjoy the wonders of the world, however summer does not mean one can take a break from learning. Every summer, students are required by their schools to complete a project during their break to assure students continue to learn. Summer projects are generally teacher-designed and based off a strict outline, which can limit the students creativity. Summer projects should be student-designed because it will motivate students to expand their learning, engage their creativity, and it will create a sense of accomplishment in the alumni, which will set them up for success.

Every year more and more students fail to complete their summer projects. One might think that they are not being completed because students do not care enough to compile to what is being asked of them. In reality students do not complete their summer projects because there is a lack of interest between the student and the theme of the project. Students should be able to design their own projects as it can motivate them to expand their knowledge while on summer vacation. Typically teacher-designed projects are based off of a strict format where a student is given a topic to research and write about. Although, many may say that having projects formatted this way will set up students for the future, they fail to realize the damage that is being done to a students interest in learning. When a student is forced to research a topic that is not of interest to them they tend to only provide what is needed of them. They do not attempt to further learn about the topic more than are required to because the goal in mind is: what is the quickest way I can get this done? However, when one allows a student to decide what they would like to create a project on one can see the excitement radiate off of their face. The student becomes motivated to start designing their project because it will be based on a topic they are passionate about.

In addition to, motivating students to expand their learning horizons, allowing students to create their own projects instead of having teacher-designed projects will allow students to engage their creative side. As said before, many teacher-designed projects have a cemented format in which they prefer their student's project's to be formatted in leaving little to any space for student creativity. By giving the student an all accesses pass to creating their own student-designed project, it allows for students to think out side the box. For instance, instead of the alumni creating a PowerPoint with several slides of repeating information, the student could design their project through a form of art. Take for example, a student who is doing a project on how pollution affects the oceans;He or she could paint a picture to further depict and attract the audiences attention to the topic being discussed. The student would also benefit tremendously through the ability of using their creativity as It has been scientifically proven that people who use their creativity are most likely to excel academically. Each and every student is smart however, at times students are unable to demonstrate this as a result of teacher-designed summer projects.

Lastly, think about a time in which you have had to work extremely to accomplish a goal and you reached it. Do you remember the pure excitement you felt as you looked back at your painstakingly hard work and realized that it was all worth it? That is the exact feeling students will feel after completing their summer projects. Students should be allowed to design their own projects as it will give students a sense of accomplishment. when the student realizes what they can do if they are determined, the student will then be furthermore motivated to do well in school and in other aspects of their life. For example, in cartoons, when a character is faced with an obstacle, trains to overcome the obstacle, and overcomes it ;it plants a seed of self confidence that will only flourish as time goes by. Like that seed the student will flourish into a responsible and academically smart student.

Students have been completing teacher-designed projects for too long and it is now time for a change by allowing students to design their own summer projects to motivate them to expand their knowledge, creativity, and to set them up for success. As a result of permitting students to do this, every student will develop a love for the free education that is provided to them. Are you willing to give students this opportunity?                       ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
7ABE298D9C05,"I believe the summer project should be student-designed because every student learns differently from another, it will express students creativity and originality, it will make it more enjoyable for students.

The student-designed summer projects will show how every student learns differently from another. Their are many ways to learn information. Student's can learn information through watching a video, reading, or even experiencing it in real life. After gathering their information, students can make a poster, a presentation, a news article, a website, or even write a song about it. The students will show the teacher the best way they learn through their choice in the project.

The summer project will also express students creativity and originality. Students creativity comes from their imaginations. Their imagination is filled with their interests and the things they are passionate about. For an example, I'm really passionate about dance and I want to learn more about the history of dance. I will make a project on the history of dance. I will use the information I already know about the subject and research more information. Every student 's project will be original and creative in their own way because everyone has different interest and ideas.

Summer break is a time for students and teachers to have fun with family, friends, and to go on vacation. They won't be thinking about school. The summer project is a great way for students to continue learning during the summer. It will be more enjoyable for students to pick the idea and the way they present it. I think this will have more students participate in the assignment and be eager to learn during the summer.

The teacher-designed summer project is also a good idea because it makes it easier for the teacher to grade the same project. It will also make it easier for students to know what their idea is and how they are going to present the project.

Over all, I think the student-designed summer project will be a great way for students to learn and present something they are passionate about through a creative way.  ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
BE467B258799,"Some schools require sudents to complete summer projects to assure that they continued learning during their break. In order for the school to know weather their students learned over their break, their summer projects must be teacher designed.

When it comes to projects that are required by the school, the projects should have high standards; which means they should be teacher-designed. Teachers put a lot of thought into their students assignments, they think about things that the student may learn in the process of doing their work. They are the ones who teach and push students to their limit so that they can benefit from it in the long run. If the projects were to be student-designed, the students will not put the same amount of effort in their work. They will not put the same amount of thought, instead they will take the easy way out which does not benefit the student intelectually. Now the easy way out for a student would be making the projects topic on something they already know by heart. This would lead the school into thinking that their student's learned something new during the summer.

In order for a student to learn over their break, they will need something a bit challenging. Something that will exercise their mind and lead them into puting more thought into their project. Usually when teachers assign projects, they give their students a rubric explaining what they expect from their work. Rubrics have standards, it gives students an idea of how their project may be great or awful. Some students may look at it and think about how they want it to be a succesful project, others will look and think about how they can improve their work. By teachers using this method they can see who really worked hard on their projects. Another way of knowing if the student's have learned would be by teachers assigning every student an individual topic. None of the students would be able to copy off of eachother for answers, they would have to find their own information.

Another way that the school would be able to assure that their students learned over break would be by a report made by a teacher. Teachers can now use certain apps to see if their students have logged in and completed a certain part of the summer project. Some teachers may assign students relieable website's recommended by the county or state in order for students to use over the summer so that they can exercise their minds. When using the site's the students would have to use specific log in account's that would connect to the teachers account. That would let the teacher see if they have been using it and if they are struggling in certian subjects in the class. Plus all the data would be recorded and could easily be sent to the school so that they can see in better depth of what their students are learning. This would be a great way to make sure that the students are learning over their break.

The only way for the school to know if the students are learning and completing their summer projects would have to be with teacher-designed projects. Teachers truley care about their students and want them to do the best that they can. Whenever students get the liberty of doing something on their own, they often cheat or end up doing anything and calling it work. But with putting standards in, it changes the entire way the student thinks and how they process everything because of the requirments they must meet. By pushing students that extra mile the school will be able to tell if they have learned once break is over and they will see improvements in their work by the time they come back from break.       ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
0FD5B95A957D,"Creativity is the heart of our current society, when given the opportunity those who have the ability to think outside the box create unimaginably beautiful things. In schools students arent given the opportunity to be as creative as they could be because of how restrictive and bland the projects and assignments made by teachers are. If our society depends on the creativity and skill set of the current generation in schools why not give them the opportunity to develop their skills and be able to flourish in their own success? Which is why I think that summer projects should be student designed because its helps students learn to become more creative and helps prepare them for the future.

Students usually spend their summer either sleeping or just having fun with their friends trying to make the most out of the break but as students reach high schools they find that they have to do projects over the summer. Almost all students are annoyed at the fact that they have to do a summer project for a class and most of them leave it till the last second to actually do it. If students were allowed to design these projects themselves it would give them the will and incentive to do it because they would have designed it in a way that it would seem interesting to them. It would help break away from their habit of carelessly doing it and having them get creative with their project and make something astonishing,

By letting students design their own projects to do over the summer it also helps them develop real life skills that they can use in the workplace. Students dont tend to learn anything new over the summer since they are focused on their break and enjoying it as much as possible but doing a project that takes time and interests them helps them learn what goes into making a project and what the requirements are. This helps students to use their new found abilities in the workplace to much more easily express their creativity since they now know the tools to show it.

When teachers make summer projects for students it makes it harder for a student to care about the project because they didnt really have a part in making it, so if the teachers decide on making a project based on a topic a student doesnt like they wouldnt be as interested. It would lead to them wanting to do the bear minimum and be done with it, never even inspiring them use their creativity. Which is why when a student makes their own project they can be more creative and choose a topic or idea that interests them related to the class doing their best effort to portray how much they care about it.

It could be argued that if students made their own projects they would make it easy that it wouldnt take any time for them to finish it. Although some students would just want to be done with their project and do something easy most students would want to use this project as an opportunity to get their point and ideas across. When a person cares about something they want it to be the best , so when a student designs a project in which they care about they would obviously want to do their best since they put so much work into it. So saying that a student wouldnt care about a project they created would be wrong since even if they did design a bad project they would be the one doing it and would make it much harder for themselves.

There is so much good that can come out of letting students design their own projects not only for them but for their future as well. If teachers give students the opportunity to design their own project then they would be teaching more than the class but skills they can use in the future as well. Since creativity is the backbone of everything in the world when teachers start to make new ideas to have students think more creatively it helps the development of new ideas and innovations in the future.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
7D2CD1D3A4F3,"Most kids don't like school as it is and its boring to them. The student-designed summer project would be better in their favor Because studens don't get to say much besides ask questions, and They have more say and more of a voice, and not every student learns the same, and summer is better than the school year because you can do more outside activities.

The project would be great for students to learn and have fun because you can do things like have a lessons with the activities where the kids can pick between thing because not all kids like everything to be just told to them. kids feel better when they can have fun and everything isn't crammed in their brains for 7 hours a day. Which would make them tired and not ready to learn. This would be perfect for students who are hands on type of learners. They can be hands on because the project is student based. Not every kid learns the same so kids who learn differently would be more comfortable because its not a 7 hour classroom environment where they just sit in class all day.

Student would have more say or more of a voice because is about them.

During the school year in the fall and winter because the teacher basically run the class and they teach they way they want and the kids just listen. By making the project student based students can present thier feelings and their feedback about what they like and don't like. It can also help teacher get a better undestanding about their students. They can also create bonds with new people such as students and teachers. Nobody want to be taught by a teacher they don't like. This will cause kids not being motivated to learn from the teacher and will probably cause bad behavior.

The project willalso make kid have more fun and they'll probably like school. You can do more activies that kids will like, like going to the pool, or planning a picnic, or just playing on a playground. You could make it so that it could be a lesson in each activity. Then they will learn while having fun. It wold be a win for everyone. It can just belittle insintives that they can get because of the weather and little brain breaks so they dont get overwelmed. Students already don't like going to school and making it fun and in their favor will make them want to come.

In conclusion students would overall like the summer project that is student designed over teacher disigned because not every student learns the same, students get more of a voice which means they get to pick between things they like, and school is just better in the summer because of the outside activities you can do.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
9CA7EB20C36E,"Many schools require their students to complete a summer project during break to assure that they continue learning while not in school. Some are simple, such as writing an essay about events that happen over the summer, while others are long and grueling such as keeping a detailed log of every day, which is something one teachers from Generic_School had us do. Some students however, find teacher-designed assignments to be a chore and a struggle because they are not interesting or engaging. In order to fix this problem, I believe that summer projects should be student-designed because the students can choose topics that will interest them and engage them, and because the projects will feel more relevant and engaging to students in similar age groups.

By giving students the chance to choose their own project topic, it will insure that they will stay interested. For example, a few years ago, my band teacher sent us home before break with a project in which we would have to design our own marching band show and theme, the only restriction being that it had to be able to be performed in under eight minutes. Everyone in the class was super excited to begin right away and many of us began planning and researching almost immediately. The amount of freedom given to us by our teacher made the project thrilling and the possibilities were endless! When we all got back from break, it was obvious how much work everyone had put into their projects and how passionate they were about them. There were dozens themes ranging from classic Rock and Roll to Star Wars. By giving us the freedom to choose the themes of our projects, my band teacher found a way to engage us all in an educational and enjoyable experience.

Giving students the freedom to design their own projects also would insure that the project will be engaging and relevant to students in similar age groups. About a year ago, I went to a two-week engineering summer camp at a college I am interested in attending. There were students there from tenth through twelfth grade from all over the state, and the camp itself was actually run by a group of college students and a few professors. Over the course of the camp we learned all about engineering and future career fields we may be interested in, but we also were given an assignment. We had to design models of an Earth themed school in groups with the materials they provided before the end of the camp. To be honest, I had expected that we would have to take a test or fill out some questionnaire on what we had learned, given that we were at a college, so this was a nice surprise. Turns out that it was in fact the college students, and not the professors, who were in charge coming up with this project. Since they were not much older than us, they knew how to get us to apply the knowledge that we had learned in a way that we would enjoy. If all projects were done like this, I'm sure many of them would be of much higher quality than a teacher-designed project.

However, there are some benefits to doing a teacher-designed project rather than a student-designed one. For one thing, rules and guidelines would most likely be very clear. One year, one of my elementary school teachers decided to let us do our own summer projects based on the events of our summer, and we would have to show up next September to present it to the class in a creative way. Let's just say that things did not work out in the end. I was one of about five students to get an A on the project because either the other kids just wrote things down on a sheet of notebook paper because they didn't know what else to do, or they had forgotten all about the assignment over the break. If the teacher had decided to give us all a few options to pick from for the project, there would most likely have been more A's.

I do believe that there are real benefits in requiring students to complete projects over summer break, but I do wish that more teachers would give students more freedoms when it comes to selecting them. By using the students' input, students will be more interested in the assignment and will be more likely to complete them. If more teachers allowed students to select their own topics for these projects, the quality of the projects would most likely be better because it would be about something that the student was passionate about. If all teachers allowed more students to give suggestions and input into their lessons and projects, then the overall quality of schools and the desire to learn would increase.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
D252A6E968AB,"Would you want to spend your summer vacation doing a project? Some schools require students to complete assignments during summer to assure they continue to learn during their break. Now what if you had to do a project that required you to stay home for 6 weeks, but you were gone all summer? What if you had absolutely no interest in a topic you had to research? Rather than being teacher designed, school summer projects should be student-designed because it gives the students more motivation to complete the project, students enjoy doing assignments in which they are interested in, and it gives students a better opportunity to succeed.

Students have more motivation to complete a project, if they are able to decide what it is that they will be doing. For instance, if I had to complete a project that required me to stay at the beach all day, I would totally do it! No one wants to do a project they have no interest in, therefore they have no sense of motivation to get it done. No basketball enthusiast wants to write a 4 page paper on the French Revolution.

Not only does a student have more motivation to complete it, but they actually enjoy doing it too. All students have their passions and things they are intersted in, why not give them the chance to use those to their advantage. Doing a project is a lot more enjoyable when you are doing it on something you are passionate about. For example, if I were given the opportunity to complete a project based off of the history of the National Hockey League, something that I absolutely love, I would totally enjoy it!

Allowing students to design their own projects gives them a better opportunity to succeed. When completing a project that you are not interested in doing, you are most likely not going to give it your best work. As a high school student athlete, my history papers usually do not turn out the best. Now if I were asked to write a paper about my development as a soccer player, I sure would get a better grade than I would on a history paper. I have learned from experience that motivation and success go hand in hand, and interest plays a big role in that.

School summer projects should be student designed because it gives students a better oppportunity to succeed, it gives the students motivation to complete the assignment, and students enjoy doing assignments that they are interested in. No one wants to spend their summer doing a project that they have absolutely no interest in, but once students are given the chance to complete a project based off of their interests, they are sure to love it. If a school should chose to assign students a project during their summer break, they should at least allow the students to decide what they are going to do their project on.        ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
B19940812E58,"Many schools around the country design and assign summer projects for students to complete over the summer break. This is help students continue to learn and keep their brains active during summer break. Summer assignments also help students prepare for their incoming classes by learning concepts before the year starts. To better benefit the student, summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge of the course curriculum and many students need a teacher who can lead them through new concepts of the class.

Summer assignments are designed to help students maintain an active mind and prepare for their upcoming classes by learning course concepts before the school year starts. Teachers are trained for years to master the subject they are going to teach and mostly likely have already seen or learned the material in the class they are going teaching. Students do not know the course curriculum before they have taken the class. If the summer assignment was designed by the students, the assignment would not be as beneficially because students do not know what the curriculum of the class is.

For example, in classes I have always been give assignments created by my teachers. But, one class my teacher gave us an open ended project where students could create their own project using our ideas. All the kids in my class took weeks and even months to find an idea for their project. The students in my class had no idea what the teacher was looking for and how to correlate their ideas into the class curriculum. However, a teacher already knows the curriculum. This will allows for a more efficient and beneficial way of learning for the student because the teacher can create assignments they know is related to the course.

Not only do student not know the course concepts, students also do not have the skills to create assignments; students need a teacher leader to guide them through the new class. When learning a new concept, students can become overwhelmed if they do not understand the topics. At my school, some classes have very little guidance from teachers to help the students understand a new topic. My friends in these classes become very overwhelmed and become more apathetic to the class. Students do not understand how to learn a new without the guidance of a teacher. A teachers job is to create assignments, tests, and projects to lead their students towards mastering a concept. When teachers create assignments they are more involved with guiding their students. If summer assignments were student-designed there would be a lack of guidance compared to an assignment made from a teacher would have. This would causes students to inefficiently learn through summer assignments.

People who support student-designed summer assignments may argue that advanced placement (AP) classes require students to learn from textbooks without the guidance of a teacher so students do not need teacher guidance. But when taking a look at the students in these AP classes, on average students in AP classes struggle and receive poor grades in these classes. This is due to the lack of teacher leadership in these classes. Students in AP classes do not get enough guidance to fully understand the curriculum.

Summer assignments should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge on the course curriculum and students need teacher guidance while learning new concepts. Summer assignments would be more effective if the teachers created the assignments themselves. Summer assignments that effectively teach students the curriculum over summer break will help benefit the students during the school year.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
DED685999785,"Summer break is a time when students forget most informormation about what they learned during the school year. Most students dont even expose themselves to learn anything school related during summer break. Some schools try to prevent that by require students to complete some summer, school related, projects or assignments to insure students are still learning and refresh their memory about what they learned through out the school year. These projects are either teacher designed or student-designed. In order for students to prove they are learning and understand the subject in which the project or assignment is about or related towards, and enjoy their summer break, teachers should assign student-designed projects to students to insure that they are learning during break.

Student-designed assignments are better because students have the freedom of working on their own pace. Students can plan accordingly from their own schedule. All students have personal lives and goals that they want to achieve during the break. Some may be in sports, have jobs, or other activities that could take up one's time. Plus, it is summer break, students want to feel free and have a break from the stressful school environment. Another factor is that some students work slower than others. When working in their own pace, they can take their time and not feel pressured from other students or the due dates from the teacher. Personally, I work slower then my peers and sometimes due dates from my teacher. Whenever I feel pressured about working slower than my peers, I find my self not learning or putting in much effort in my work causing me to rush and not able to enjoy learning or that subject, causing me to not learn from that assignment and do poorly in that assignment and getting a bad grade on it. When Im able able to work on my own pace, I feel a lot less pressured and actually enjoy doing the assignment, plus I can learn my own way and put in much more effort in my work. In addition, I can enjoy my summer break on my own time.

Another reason is that students can develop or find a work method that can improve their learning. It also helps students become more independent. It is common that all students can't learn in the same way, some learn different from others. When able to do the project their way, they can find or develop a work method that can help students to learn and get something out from the project. Students will be more productive when they can learn their own way. Plus when they go back to school or grow up, they will have their own ethic that works best for them to help them out in the real world or school. In addition, it also helps students to practice responsibilities and being independent. So when they go back to school, they can start off the year fully knoweleged and productive. Personally, I learn differently than my peers, and I had to find a learning ethic to help me accominate my knowledge with the rest of my class. At first, school was hard because I did not know how to get good grades. It took time, but eventually, I was able to catch up with my peers and finally understand what was being taught to me. Plus I see my self able to work independently and no longer need someone to teach me the subject again and give me extra help, I am able to do things more independently.

Finally, students are able to express their own knowledge and ideas related to the project. The main reason for schools requiring students to do summer projects, is to insure students are still learning over the long break. Therefore students can prove what they learned over the break, and express their own ideas and knowledge on the project. This can help teachers understand where their students are in the subject and help them, if needed, through out the year. Also this can be a great time to help teachers to know their students a little more personally and understand how each one of them think and understand ideas. When students are allowed to express their own knowledge, it shows what students personally learned through their work, proving that students are doing their own work. It also helps to prevent cheating or multiple students having the same answer on their work.

Although some may think that teacher-designed projects are a better option than student-designed, some may argue that with teacher-designed assignments, teachers set up due dates and a rubric of whats required on the project. Some may argue that students are most likely to procrastinate on the assignment if they choose their own dates, so having due dates through out the summer will sort of ""keep students on track"" to do their work and having a rubric to help those who don't know what should be on the project, but having a rubric and due dates can also make students unable to build or practice that independent work ethic and will most likely end up relying on someone to do the responsibility. However, students have lives and the teacher doesn't know everyone's schedule. By enforcing due dates, it could cause some students to rush and unable to put their own full effort, rather than actually learning and enjoying the project. Also having a rubric that details exactly what must be on the project also can increases academic dishonesty by requiring each student having similar to almost the same project with possibly the same information instead of allowing students to express their knowledge their own way.

Teachers should assign student-designed summer projects to students to insure that they are learning during their break. Allowing students to design their own project can allow students to work on their own time, practice or find a good personal learning method and express what they learned and their ideas. Students can practice responsibility and being independent. So not only are students learning whatever subject, but they are also getting long term benefits to help them personally in life. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
A4BC2726A9F0,"These summer projects should be teacher- designed so the projects can be a challenge for the students, the teachers would be able to provide the students help when they have a question about the project, it will be easier for the students. teachers should provide a challenge, also will be given a short lesson on what it is on.

Teacher's are smart enough to give students or provide students with a challenge. Opposed to teachers, the students will find something effortless and easy to do. At that point it wouldnt be a challenge and they won't learn anything new. It wouldnt be a very difficult project either. It would just be hard enough to be a challenge to the students so they can spend more time learning about the subject instead of looking them up on the internet. Teacher wants the best for the students so they wouldn't give something out that they know you won't be able to do it.

Therefore, A teacher wouldn;t give out a project without teaching about it first. A teacher would give an example and teach you about the project so it won't be that hard on you anyways. students would know ahead of time if they have an issue with the teaching method or the project itself. It could help parents know what to do and how to help there own child with there project or anything else throughout the year. so i think its a good idea for the student to pay attention in the class when the teacher is explaining it.

Also, when you have a problem or an issue you can always ask the teacher. you can via text or email the teacher whenever you have an issue or a problem with the project. Dont understand the material just email your teacher and she will respond when she is able to. Even if you and someone else has the same problem then you two can work it out. You can contact your teacher and say that multiple people are having the same issues and it's not only you. If this was a student-designed project then it would be hard and wouldn't know who to ask.

In conclusion, there are many teachers who worry about there student. They think that they will forget everything that they have learned about. It could be possibly true that students can forget what they have learned and so it a good idea to give summer break projects so they can keep refreshing there minds about the topic that they learned about. I feel like the slotions for students to not forget aboout what they learned is summer break projects. These summer projects should be teacher- designed so the projects can be a challenge for the students, the teachers would be able to provide the students help when they have a question about the project, it will be easier for the students. teachers should provide a challenge, also will be given a short lesson on what it is on.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
9D7DC07877A6,"I belive that summer projects should be student-designed. Students could have more crativity, expressing emotions through their projects, higher grades, expanding their crative mind.

By students getting the chance to designe their own projects they can expand their creative minds. Students can get creative with their art and that could inspire others no matter how hard it might get. They could push themsleves to get out of their comfort zone and this could lead them to have bigger oppoutunties. Students getting the chance to do their own project could make them follow through with it.

By students designing their own projects they could express emotion through art and color. A project could have a deeper meaning such as: religon, expreience, or something they believe in and this could keep a student by following with the project and actually finishing it. Students getting the chance to designe their own projects could be benifical to those who suffer with depprestion. They could use art as a way to cop with what they're suffering with by expressing their emotions. It could inspire them to keep it pushing no matter what.

Benifits could come by students designing their own projects such as getting better grades. Students who don't do their work and get a faling grade could benifit from this. They could think that the way of the teacher doing the project is boring and with this they can have more freedom and show off their creativity. This could inspire studnents to do their work. Students could follow through with their project's and get good grade's by them desgning the way they prefer it. They could feel more comfrotable with doing the project by them doing it how they want to.

Students get the chance to explore new things and they can use that expreince to their benfit. By students getting the chance to try new things they could step out of their comfort zone and get the chance to explore new talents. Within students exploring new things they gain knowlege and gain more expreince on ther project.

Students should get the chance to disigne their own projects. By doing so they could gain more knowlege on the subject the project is on. This could come to their benfit by them getting oppourtunties and better grades.             ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
0CB3CA3672E2,"My grandma always told me that students should be able to create their own projects, because they get to work on things they like instead of being forced to do what the teachers want. Students should design their own projects because they get to have their own freedom and pick things that excite them.

Students should get to design their own summer project, because they get to pick whatever topic they want. For example students learn more when its about something they like because they don't have somebody always telling them what to do and how to do it. This also gives kids the opportunity to be creative, get out of their comfort zone, and to explore new things instead of learning what the teachers want them to learn. This proves that students should be able to come up with the summer projects instead of teacher.

Some people think the teachers should design the projects because teachers know more than students, however they're wrong because that sets a bad example for the students because they're going to think everything is always going to be handed to them and they'll never know how to be independent. For example some kids work and do better when doing something that interests them which will motivate them to want to keep learning about it; the students also would also get to express themselves through it.

If you think students should be able to do their own projects then you should switch it up here and there so they can do things on there own to show that they're responsible and don't always need a teacher to do everything for them.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
20141DCB5346,"I believe school summer projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects will help a student express their creativity, it will be less complicated, and it will let them learn about a topic they are interested in. If the project is student-designed, it is most likely for them to keep up with it and not set it aside. Students should be trusted to build something on what they learned on their own.

Even though not all students come up with astonishing ideas, all of them have the capacity to be creative. Creativity is important when it comes to projects. It helps a project look presentable, it also helps the audience gain interest. Students can let their imagination discover more ideas when a project is not teacher-designed because their options are not limited. Not only will it be more exciting to do a project, but it will increase students' grade by showing their creativity.

A student-designed project will relieve stress from students by being able to create whatever they please. Instead of having to assemble something difficult given by a teacher, a student will choose an easier option for themselves, so they will not build up pressure. Since they will most likely pick a non difficult idea, they can complete their project faster. Therefore, students will enjoy their summer break more.

Furthermore, most students will choose an option they are intrigued in, which makes a project become more interesting. Students will pick one out of a variety that they enjoy; they will stay on task. For example, the more engaged the students are to their project the more it will help them stay focused. When they pick a topic they like, the project becomes more simple to make because it is genuine or sincere.

Given all these points, summer projects should be designed by students. It will make it more easier for the students to work on and more interesting for the teacher to read. All of the students' creativity and engagement in the project can lead to positive outcomes. Students should enjoy their summer break while creating an incredible project they love. Teachers should not doubt students when they design their own projects.        ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
73656858947C,"Over the summer, very few students have the desire to do any homework, especially not a project. In the scenario where a school mandates a summer project, the summer project should be student-designed. Having student-designed projects would make the assignment easier for students to complete and it would also ensure that the students are gaining knowledge from completing the assignment. Assigning a project that isn't grueling and time consuming, as teacher-designed projects tend to be, would result in more students completing the assignment and learning.

Many students never complete projects during the regular school year, and assigning a summer project would seem like an impossible task. However, if the project appealed to students it would be more likely that they would complete it and this could spark a butterfly effect that leads into the next year for those students. It would cause students who don't complete projects or assignments, to turn into consistent, non-procrastinating students. Learning is often made into a very monotonous and dreadful thing but if schools designed learning for students, intelligence would be more spread out across the school. There wouldn't be the groups of ""smart kids"", the groups of ""dumb kids"", or the groups of ""average kids"" and the school, as a whole, would be more successful.

A very typical and repetitive summer project is ""summer reading"". Many schools don't assign this as a mandatory project that is expected to be completed by every student, but is often assigned as a prerequisite to enter high level English classes or to join certain clubs. When the school year begins, a lot of very educated and worthy students are denied the ability to attend that high level class because they haven't completed the summer reading project. Now the logic behind this is, ""If a student can't read one book over the summer, how can they be expected to read multiple books throughout the entire English course ?"". What many people don't take into account, is the fact that regardless of a teenager's intelligence, they will usually neglect all school work until the last minute and end up forgetting. They will either end up not being able to fully put their knowledge to use, or lying about reading in order to enter a class, neither of these outcomes benefit the student.

An argument against these claims would be, ""If teacher-designed projects are assigned, it will be easier for teachers to grade the assignment and this could benefit the student even more by giving them a better grade and better feedback."". Teacher-designed projects are capable of this, and students would be able to receive more well-rounded, and understood grades if the assignment was being graded based off of a rubric. With a teacher-assigned project, teachers can compare each student's work to past projects that have been completed by other students and accurately determine how good the project is. These types of projects ensure that all students will learn the same amount by eliminating the option for students to do projects about something they are already very educated about in their personal life.

Student-designed projects are more reliable and consistent than teacher-designed projects. They allow students to fully display their intelligence and academic potential. They also allow students to educate themselves about a topic. This leads to better learning habits in the future; and overall, it can turn a good student into an even better student. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
26E218908B4C,"Summer break provides students with a time to relax and refresh in preparation for the following year. The break is a necessity in the school systems as it offers students the opportunity to experience different aspects of life outside of the classroom. Additionally, this period to refresh assists students in their learning career as it prevents academic burnout. However, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. In situations where summer projects are assigned, projects should be student-designed for they allow students to take initiative in their learning, gain a deeper understanding of the chosen topic, and minimize the chance that students feel they are not being given a break.

In allowing students to design their own project, the student is given the opportunity to take charge of their learning. The initiative a student-designed project offers allows students to choose a topic they are interested in and later hope to pursue. For example, a young student with little interest in art and literature would not benefit from being forced to read certain novels throughout the summer. Exposure to the essential texts needed to further their language abilities will be gained throughout the school year. Therefore, as the school year already provides students with the basic skills to advance their academic career, summer should be a time students have the opportunity to pursue their own interests, best achieved through the completion of student-designed projects.

Likewise, with the idea that a student designs a project on a topic they are interested in, the project will be done more thoroughly, allowing students to gain a deeper understanding. As a human tendency, people are more likely to work on something they are interested and excited about. The more the project is worked on, the more complex and thorough it will be. Interest and excitement in a topic positively affect the extent to which the project will be worked on. Typically, the time spent on the project is directly related to the overall understanding of the concept. Considering teachers assign summer work to assure students continue learning during their break, projects should be student-designed as they promote a deeper understanding of the given topic.

Lastly, having students complete a project they have designed themselves minimizes the feeling of the traditional school dynamic. Throughout the school year, students are assigned the work they need to complete in order to receive an ""A."" Completing work is often done out of requirement rather than personal interest. Summer is used as a break from the many requirements of school. A student-designed project will seem like less of a requirement as it is based upon self-interest. Minimizing the feeling that the work must be done out of requirement ensures students have the time to refresh while continuing their academics.

In conclusion, summer is a vital time for students to take a break from the hardships of the previous school year. Yet, some teachers want to assure students continue their learning over the break. If a school believes summer work should be assigned, projects should be student-designed. A project designed by a student encourages them to take initiative in their learning, gain a deeper understanding of the chosen topic, and still feel as if they had a break from school and its traditional dynamic. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
FFF1442D6698,"Every student looks forward to summer break, it's all about sunshine and going out for fun. After a long time, they are able to stop focusing on school for quite some time. Although,it is relieving to take a break, students tend to forget some knowledge once they have to return to school. This is because of the summer they just spent doing nothing that's school related. For this reason, summer projects are created. It helps students to continue the learning process and keep a hold of their knowledge. Some may argue that these summer projects should be designed by the students, others may say they should be designed by the teachers. These summer projects would end up better if designed by the teachers because teachers already know the materials that need to be learned and they can challenge their students' abilities.

Furthermore, students aren't going to be enthusiastic about a summer project, most kids these days enjoy doing anything that doesn't involve school. It's more of an obligation if they have to do summer projects. So, asking students to design a project for themselves would be like asking them to stop using their phones forever. They won't want to do it because students don't like extra work. This is when teachers come in to play, they are more knowledgeable. Teachers have spent so much time learning a certain subject. They can easily set an objective for the students because it's what they've trained for. Teachers are also aware of what needs to be learned, while students are used to being told what to learn. This makes it easier for teachers to create a project. Students, on the other hand, would sit there clueless not knowing what to create nor how to. How would they know what they need to accomplish learning from creating their own project? It would be too difficult and it's time consuming not knowing where to start. Teachers are more organized and well prepared for creating assignments, activities, and projects. It wouldn't be smart to have the students create the project knowing students are less responsible and less organized with completing tasks.

Now, some people may think: ""If students create their own project then they would do it,"" but students would rather create something to their own benefit. What I mean by this is, students will come up with a task that's easy enough to complete. Nothing challenging, time consuming, and well organized would be taken in to consideration. They don't want to create something that makes them have to think outside the box. They'd rather keep it simple. So, it's best if teachers take that responsibility. A teacher can tell what their students' weaknesses and strengths are. Which helps them create something that can be a challenge to the students' mind yet, be able to be completed as well. This will allow the student to think outside the box and be able to understand what the teacher is trying to teach them while the summer break is taking place. Once they return to school they will already have that knowledge with them because they learned it over the summer and got a hold of the lesson that needed to be learned.

To sum it up, summer projects should be designed by teachers and not students. This should be done this way because teachers have a better understanding as to what to do and how to create a project with objectives. Students are used to following instructions in order to learn, so having them create their own project to learn would be difficult to actually accomplish learning a certain topic. The teachers can set the expectations and what needs to be learned by the students;therefore, allowing them to easily follow along and complete the task. Students don't like doing work during the summer, so asking them to create work for themselves would take a lot out of them. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
F3A52106F794,"Imagine you are in the middle of a wonderful summer break. When suddenly, you received an email; you opened it, and it happens to be from your teacher. There it is, your summer assignment; after glancing through the rubric document, you let out a big sigh. The requirements and tasks on the rubric were super complex, and it does not interest you whatsoever. You thought to yourself that if this summer project was to be a student-based assignment, then you would enjoy it a lot more. Thus, this lead me to believe that summer projects should be student-designed because it expands students' creativity, give students motivation, and students will have a more likely chance to succeed.

Student-designed projects give students a sense of creativity. Students will be able to express themselves, and show their teacher their fullest potential. Student-designed projects allow students to be more creative through learning by thinking outside of the box. This is because students will have the freedom to go above and beyond their limits, due to the fact that there won't be any certain requirements. Students can also be themselves, and create a final product that meets their teachers' standards. Without realizing it, students can end up creating a masterpiece that they would never have thought they'd be able to create before.

Not only will student-designed projects give students a sense of creativity, but it also give students more motivation. According to

The National Education of Youth Institution , a student stated that he was completely stressed while completing his assignment, which was teacher-designed. Since he did not know what to do for his summer project, this gave him lots of anxiety and stress. This shows that teacher-designed projects will not benefit students, but rather do more harm to the students' health. However with student-based projects, students tend to be more motivated and dedicated to completing their work; as a result, this will provide a positive atmosphere and mindset for students. Motivation is an important concept in learning because it is what strives students to go above and beyond. By having the motivation to complete the assignment, students will have more interest in their activity, and will enjoy it more.

Furthermore, students will have a more likely chance to succeed. Student-based projects will ultimately benefit students because they will be more confident in obtaining a good grade, due to them originally creating the project with their own ideas. A study at Harvard University shows that 86% of students received above an 80%, a B letter grade, on their graded student-designed summer projects. After looking at the statistic, we can conclude that students whom had the opportunity to complete a student-designed assignment, were more likely to succeed and earn a decent grade.

To summarize the totality of the argument, students will have a more beneficial and practical effect when completing a student-designed project rather than a teacher-designed project. Summer assignments should be student-designed because it gives students a sense of creativity, motivate students to do their best, and more students will succeed in the end. Student-designed projects will not only have a big impact on the future of education, but on the students as a whole. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
23B709C8F85A,"Although summer assignments designed by teachers are proven to be more professional and effective for student learning while they are on their break, summer projects should be created by students because it will prove less stressful and more lenient for the students to complete assignments made by their peers rather than their teachers.

Summer assignment that are student-designed will prove to be a more lenient workload than assignments made by teachers. Summer projects made by teachers usually include a tremendous workload with more than just one thing to do. For example, in the summer of my freshman year of high school, my world history teacher assigned the class a one hundred paged packet where we had to answer fifteen questions on each page. To complete that project I had to complete one page a day, but by the time the new year came around I still was not able to finish the assignment. That assignment had proven to be extremely difficult and excessive in its workload, as a result I was not able to complete it. Students are capable are creating assignments that will prove that projects do not need to be excessive in workload to assure that they are learning. For example, in my English class, we were given an assignment where the students had to create a worksheet with questions created on our own then give it to another student to complete. When I received my peer's worksheet, the questions were not so easy to where I didn't have to think at all but it proven just difficult enough to complete without thinking as hard. This example is made to show how when students are the ones creating the assignments it demonstrates how a student can receive learning from the assignment but it is not as rigorous as the assignments designed by teachers. Even though teacher-designed projects are designed for the strict purpose of assuring learning, student designed projects prove learning can be achieved but it is achievable without the tremendous workload.

Teacher-designed projects have proven to be extremely stressful on students and summer assignments created by students will relieve other students of that stress. A majority of the time, projects made by teachers are so difficult that they inflict stress and anxiousness in the students because of the fear they will not complete it. For example, for the same history project I had to complete during the summer of freshman year, the difficulty and the length of the packet inflicted fear and anxiousness in me that I would not be able to finish the assignment. These type of projects inflict stress on students and stress is not good for the mental health of growing teenagers. Whenever students create assignments they not only create what is most academically suited to them, but also create assignments to where they won't have go over their limits and won't have to stress themselves out either. Although teacher-designed assignments prove effective of students knowledge of the topics the assignments are based on, assignment made by students will not only assure learning but will prove to be less stressful for the students completing the assignment.

In conclusion, summer projects should be created by the students rather than the teachers because students know how difficult and stressful summer assignments can be, as a result they can make assignments that will not only assure learning over the break, but won't inflict stress and hardship onto the students who have to complete it. Teachers have always designed assignments assigned over the break to make sure student do aquire learning while being away from school. Student projects should always remain learning but the assignments given to them should not be so difficult to the point where they are fearful and stress over not completing it. Because of this, summer projects should be student-designed for the sake of the students mental health and to prove that summer assignments do not need to be excessive in its workload to ensure learning.        ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
DFEAEC512BAB,"Should students design a summer project for school? Yes students should design the summer project. Plenty of students would get their projects done; it'll be better understanding and easier on the students. I believe the summer project should be designed by the students because the students are going to be able to choose what is going to helped them over the break with their summer projects like making it fun to do maybe with friends, family members, or anything to get your summer projects done.

More students would turn in the summer projects. From school experiences when students come back from their summer break plenty of students don't have their summer projects because students don't like the books they have to choose from. The project should be fun for students its their summer break it should be fun and about things they like and turn it an essay about what they did over the summer. The summer project should be designed by students so more students could turn in their projects when they arrive back to school from their break.

Students would be interested in doing them if they were designed by the students. If the project would be student designed it would be much easier for students because the student will have to find something that interested in and what they like and also it would make it much better because the students would have to talk about a couple things that helped them with doing the summer project. Summer projects should be a little fun, better than the way a teacher would design the summer project. Students could make it creative and fun it doesn't have to be boring. Students like to do fun things with school not always just doing work that's boring.

It would help if getting a couple students from different grade levels to talk about the summer project. The students would talk about what is going to be needed for the project. Students are going to agree and disagree about what they dont like about the way the teacher designed the summer projects and turn it into somethings students like and an easier and fun way for students to do their summer projects. Getting experiences from other students on what they like and don't about the teacher way of designing the project is helpful, so the students know what they should be looking for when designing the project for students.

I believe that the students should design the summer project in a fun and creative way instead of reading books and telling things about the book, therefore more students can get them done. I could see why it should be teacher designed because teachers know exactly what their looking towards when trying to help students see their problems in certain areas, but students understand things more when it's coming from experience. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
79887DA7C1B1,"Summer is a time that both students and teachers tend to enjoy. It gives the students a chance to relax, and not worry about things such as homework, projects, quizzes, and tests. The teachers also get a chance to take a break from grading and assigning work. Yet, if students still had to do a summer project in order to keep learning over the summer, it should be student-designed because students tend to be busier over the summer with many different things, and the project should cater to their schedule.

During the school year, most students are very busy with school work, along with different activities such as jobs, sports, and school clubs. For the most students, summer is the only opportunity that they have to relax, or spend time with family and friends. Vacations and family events are usually panned to take place during the summer. And a school project could interfere with that precious time. The student should be the one to design the project in order for it to be flexible to their schedule.

Students designing their on projects would also be a great opportunity for teachers to get a break. Many teachers tend to spend hours on end coming up with lesson plans and grading work. Although teachers would still have to grade the project, the student would be taking a small work load off of the teacher by designing the summer project themselves, And, it could possibly educate the teacher on a different subject.

Giving students the benefit of designing the summer project could also let them be more creative =, and enjoy the task at hand. Most of the time when students have to do projects, it is based off of a subject that is being taught in school: Such as math, history, and science. Letting students be more creative could also allow them to integrate their summer project into their summer schedule. Such as calculating the total amount of hours they have worked, doing historic research on the family vacation spot, or counting how many steps was taken during a hike.

Some may argue that students would not be responsible enough to plan and execute the summer project. Though, there are students who do not do the appropriate amount of work throughout the school year, many students already handle great responsibilities in their life; such as babysitting a younger sibling, sports practices, and having a job to not only support themselves, but their families too.

As previously stated, summer is usually an important time for both students and teachers. Rather they use it to participate in activities, or family events. Or, relax and take a break from school and work. At the end of the day, a student's education is important to maintain. But, so is their time and schedules. That is why students should be the ones to design their own summer project. Along with the fact that it would lighten up a teachers work load so they as well could enjoy their time off.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
BF6BB8DC9EF7,"Should schools require students to do summer projects? Well I agree with this topic because, some students would want to require better learning experiences that would help them figure out ideas in the future to come; but instead of letting teachers decide we as students should be able to come up with ideas that would fit in with our learning pace. As students we would have more time to figure out everything we need in order to make a good project. Student decisions is made for a summer project.

As students we can talk about what we have learned in class or even at home. Making a project about nature is something you can create for your science class next school year. We would be able to show off our skills as a team in order to let the true leadership come out of everyone. We should be able to partner up with someone that is determined to learn. Doing a summer project on something you done in class would help the most because mainly we already know what we have worked on; but instead of copying basically what you know you be creative. Working as a team isnt easy or hard it will come to you if only we put our minds into it.

Some schools have teachers that want students to better themselves for a purpose. Teachers are settings students up for if there going to college. College isnt made for everyone, some colleges give projects that have to be turned in at a certain point of time. Like writing essays or doing group activity projects. While your in school teachers want you to better yourselves to be someone that you want to be in life. You dont necessarily have to have an poster project, teachers can give you projects that doesnt deal with school it'll just better our community. Projects arent always on paper it can be something else if you or the teacher ant it to be.

Being able to learn during a summer break is hard, because we as children would probably have something to do, like family trips, field trips, and etc.. But if learning is something that is accomplished on its own. We can come up with projects on our own, we can be out of state and take pictures of something that fascinates us and than we could put it on a poster, or even a presentation. Being able to come to school from summer break starting a whole new year, you could talk about the amazing things you saw in a sideshow. Not knowing that we are doing a project basically everyday, it's basically life. Projects can come in many forms, but being able to do them as a team would make it more fun for school and the summer.

While teachers teach and students learn, students should be able to learn on there own at some point. Teacher dont always have to give us work on there topic we should be able to come up with some good ideas that'll be creative in the learning environment. This is why I agree with students should be able to make there own decisions.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
D60320508249,"By being allowed to design their own summer projects, students are afforded significantly many more opportunities to learn outside of the classroom and are also able to accomplish their project with a degree of flexibility, letting them both enjoy their time off but also retain information that they learned the previous year.

Many students have quite the chaotic schedule during the summer months. Between jobs, internships, and trying to enjoy their time away from school, it's easy for teacher-assigned work to get tossed by the wayside during this time. Additionally, for some people it is difficult to do things like hop online and complete lessons or sit down with a calculator and figure out equations, since their schedules simply don't allow it. This can be a problem for anyone who participates in programs such as Outward Bound or those who will spend a few weeks in another country on vacation or in the middle of nowhere building houses with their church.

By letting their summer work be student-driven, kids will be able to adapt their commitments to their teacher's desire to have them continue their learning over the break and not have to worry about finishing assignments by deadlines that they already know aren't possible for them to meet. For example, if a student is going to Latin America over the summer, instead of having them mindlessly conjugate verbs on worksheets to submit for their Spanish class, they can actually put what they learned to use out in the world by talking with locals or taking in the culture through music and food. If another student doesn't happen to have a passport and a couple thousand dollars lying around, they can adjust it to their situation, for example going to a local Latin grocery store and buying ingreedients in Spanish in order to make a native dish.

However, the opportunities extend beyond just languages and cultures. If a student is interning at a company in a different city, they have to learn a variety of skills, one of which being how to budget correctly. Here, they can employ what they learned in their math class in order to help them out with their finances by figuring out how much things will cost and what percentages of their money will have to go to which necessity. Again, this applies to everyone, as students who don't have that opportunity still get the chance to apply their math abilities to their own lives, as they might want to figure out how to divide up their paychecks from their summer job between spending and saving money.

These examples highlight another main benefit of letting students design their own summer projects, that being the increased opportunities that are availible outside of the classroom. Instead of having one general project assigned by the teacher that is monotonus and isn't any different than regular school, students can customize their learning to their specific situation and access things that aren't availible inside the classroom. Students that are interested in making music can apply for internships at music studios that have nicer equipment than their school. Students that enjoy writing can work with local journalists and get a feel for what writing is like for a bigger publication than just their school paper.

One might be thinking at this point, ""Come on now. This is great for all the kids who are motivated to learn and are enough of a go-getter to go out and do this stuff, but what about the ones who just want to sit inside and play video games or hang out with their friends?"" This is where the real beauty of student-designed work comes in. Even those who don't want to have to sacrifice their precious three months of freedom can still get in valuable time applying what they learned the previous school year. Spend your summer days inside playing video games? Calculate your win rate or determine your average time taken to complete certain levels. Prefer to hang out with your buddies at the pool all day? Determie your arc in the air doing different tricks off the diving board. The ability to adapt one's schedule to their situation is infinitely better than doing some general assignment handed out by a teacher, for all types of people.

If students can create their own project that is specific to their life over the summer, then they are accomplishing several goals. It allows them to actually get the work done, instead of being unable to do so based off of their schedule. It lets them be interested in their learning instead of complaining about a boring stack of worksheets that that have to robotically complete. Most importantly, however, it gives them the chance to experience things outside of the classroom that are both personalized to their lives and also accomplishing their teacher's goal of getting them to continue to learn information, ensuring that student-designed projects present the best of both worlds.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
759C3FAFA8BF,"Imagine having to do a summer project over a topic you don't like. Some schools have decided to do this with their students in order for them to still learn while they are on summer break. Although the teacher can make sure you have a topic that you have learned about, the students should design the project. The project should be student designed because they can chose how they want to do the project, they don't have to worry about not knowing the topics, and can be a topic that they like or enjoy.

Firstly, the students can chose how they want to do their project. For example, they could chose how they would want to present their project. Either by choosing to have a report or a presentation to show the class. Another example is they might want to have a group project. The more hands they have the more creative they can make the assignment. Both of these examples show that choosing how they do their project helps them feel comfortable.

Next, they wouldn't have to worry about not knowing the topic if they get to chose. For example, if their picking topics they would chose one that they remember. The students wouldn't pick a topic they didn't understand or remember for their assignment. Another example is that they could pick one that fascinates them. Like for a science project they could pick a marine wildlife topic, if thats what they find entertaining, or for English class they could pick one of their favorite authors or books. These examples represent the fact that if they were to pick their topics it will allow them to be engrossed with it.

Lastly, this project could be something they like or enjoy. Like in my first example having a group project can make it more enjoyable. Because their in a group they could have friends working alongside them making it more fun. This project is where they might be able to let their creative side take control. Students would want the work to be colorful and interesting. Both having friends and being creative let the kids have a fun and enjoyable time doing their project.

In conclusion, the students should design their own summer project because they can chose how they want to do the project, don't have to worry about not knowing the project, and can be something they like or enjoy. Would you let your teacher design your project?",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
73072846598F,"Summer projects are beneficial in allowing students to continue learning throughout their summer break. By working on a short essay or PowerPoint over this three month span can allow students to achieve their goals in understanding a certain subject better. However, the debate about these projects is if they should be teacher-designed or student-designed. While some may believe that teachers know more about learning than students, I believe that these projects should be student designed in order to make them more enjoyable to the students, help the students individually, and give the students a break from the typical classroom norms.

First, making these summer projects student-designed would make them more enjoyable to the students. Students know what they enjoy doing and what they do not like. At first, summer projects may sound like a hassle for students, but if they design an exciting project, they may be excited to start it and turn it in for grading. For example, when I was in the eighth grade, my English teacher assigned us a long list of vocabulary to do over the summer. My classmates and I were all dreading the 100 vocabulary words that we had to define by ourselves. However, if we were allowed to put our own spin on it and create a PowerPoint or hands-on project, then we may have been more motivated to learn the vocabulary words and retain the information in a more beneficial way.

Also, the students know what subjects they struggle to learn in. Some students have trouble in math or science, while others struggle with reading or history. By allowing the students to create a summer project that focuses directly on a subject that the student knows they need help with would be more beneficial than just a random assignment that the teacher chooses for everyone. For example, I struggle with history, so when I fall behind in class, I ask my teacher for help and he will assign me extra credit work that is based on the topic that I am struggling with. This extra credit benefits me more than just a worksheet or a quiz and I begin to actually understand the topic.

Moreover, these student-designed projects would also give the students a break from the typical classroom norms. During the school year, teachers will assign worksheets or packets of information that is used one time in the class and then never thought of again. They also use tests and quizzes to store information in the students head for a short period of time. By allowing the students to create a project that they would enjoy and is proctored to their specific learning style, could motivate the students to learn and retain the information better than they would in a typical class.

Therefore, the student-designed summer projects are the best solution to keep the kids learning, but also not overwhelm them with work. Allowing the students to create a project that they would throughly enjoy doing is not only beneficial to their learning, but also their attitude towards the school. Creating a project on a particular subject that they know they struggle with could motivate them to do better and help them develop a passion for learning. Also, swaying away from the usual learning styles that are shown in the classroom can also give the students a break while also allowing them to continue learning. Although teachers know what to teach and how to teach, the students have to have a passion for learning before they can retain any information and student-designed summer projects are the best solution.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
EA317CE76E48,"The summer before the upcoming school year, many schools require students to do a summer project. These projects are usually designed to make sure that the students are still learning over their break. When these projects are assigned, the teachers are in charge of what the project is going to be about. Most students feel as if they should decide what the project should be about. I believe that teachers should design summer projects because when the following school year comes along the project will go along with what they are about to learn, the students would be challenged, and it would be overall more beneficial to the students as a whole.

When teachers design a project, it always has some sort of purpose behind it. Assigning these projects over the summer would allow students to have a start on the lesson before the school year starts. The students would have an idea of what they would be learning about the upcoming school year. With this advantage, teachers would use time in the classroom more effectively. This will also cause students to have the thought of school already in their mind.

Another factor to look into when teachers design the summer projects, it would create a challenge for the students. If the students were in charge of designing a project, then they are most likely to pick something that doesn't require a lot of thought. As a teacher, their job is to generate the students' mind. Designing challenging projects would do just that. This would cause students to have the urge to learn more about the project. Also, when they get back to school they would have numerous questions about the project.

Although some may say that if teacher-designed projects are implemented, then the students may not be interested. Simply because of the fact that it is not a topic they particularly want to learn about. While that may be true, ultimately it would be more beneficial the students if the teacher designed them. If the students creates the project, then they could possibly pick a topic that doesn't really benefit them in the future. When the teachers create the project, the students are more likely to get something out of the project.

In closing, teachers should design the summer projects. This decision would benefit the students as whole. It would guarantee that the students are actually learning during the summer. Teachers wouldn't have to worry about students making a project that didn't require a lot of thinking. Also, it would cause teachers to not start a completely fresh lesson when the school year starts. The whole idea of summer projects is to continue learning outside the ten month school year, that can't happen if the students are in charge of the other two months. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
1734511166A2,"I belive that these summer projects should be student designed rather than teacher designed. Students are able to work better if they get to design what their project should be about and have the chance to be more creative, they are also less likey to be stressed about doing it wrong. If these projects are teacher designed, students are limited to what they are capable of doing.

When students get the chance to design and pick what they can learn about for their project, they will most likely pick something that they are pasionate about. Which means that they will most likey have more information about it and have the opportunity to be more creative on the finished product. For example, if a student wanted to to bulid a model about something they like, then they will work as hard as they can to complete it to the best of their abilities. It doesn't matter what topic they choose, all that matters is that they are using their time wisley and learing about something new or learning more about something they already knew.

Having to do a project over the summer in general is stressful enough, so having a teacher get to design the kind of project students should do, would add even more stress. This stress could lead to students wanting to give up on the project and not complete it. Students are excited about summer because it means they won't have the stress of doing work for school, so if you design something that is easy and know a lot about, causes youto get it done quicker and enjoy the rest of your summer worry free.

In my opinion, I think that is would be less stressful if I could get the chance to design my own project. I wouldn't have to worry about holding up to what a teacher expects me to do and only worry about what I know i can do.

Concequently, if these projects are teacher designed, students are limited to what they are capable of doing. It limits their creativity and their work ethic. For instance, if student wanted to create a type of art work about what they learned about, they wouldn't be able to do that if a teacher got to choose the kind of design the student had to do. Students are expected to do their best and succeed, limiting them to do a specific project would only casue them to do the opposite. Students are capable of doing great things if you let them.

In conclusion, students should have the opportunity to design their own project. Letting students design their own projects would only effect them in a positve way. It would cause them to do their very best and improve their creativity. They would be less stressed about doing what a teacher expects and get the project done much quicker. Students would have more time to enjoy their summer worry free. Teacher designed projects would only limit them to what they are actually capable of doing. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
1F51352E0E5F,"Summer projects. The way schools assure that students continue learning during break. During summer, students often find themselves forgetting most of the material they had learned the previous year. A way to stop this from happening is to require students to complete a summer project. Alas, it is difficult to decide if the project should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed since it promotes creativity, invokes passion, and encourages students to be independent.

A student-designed project promotes the students creativity. Generic_Name found himself wanting to be more creative after he finished his project. Promoting creativity in a project may spread more to a students daily life and strengthen their creativity. Since summer break is so long that the student's creativity could keep building. Generic_Name saw that he was able to solve problems quicker based on how creative he was. This can transfer over to other task the student may need to get done. Along with that it could make the summer project progress quicker than usual. Although a project does require creativity, it also needs some care.

Allowing a student to design a project the way they like it, creates passion. Generic_Name like it when he can choose what he wants to do because he can do something he cares for.

A Student that cares for a project will work on it more and one that dislikes their project. Summer break allows students to have a long amount of time to work on something they love, drastically improving the quality. Generic_Name had more pride in his work because he cared for it.

Caring for the project and finish it can create a pride in the project and in ones self. Also, with the more time someone works on a project the more pride that person can get for finishing it. The benefit of a student-designed project can be good for the short term and long term.

Projects that are student-designed encourages students to be independent. Generic_Name enjoyed his project since it gave him a taste of independence. Getting a sense of independence is good for teens since they are about to become young adults. Along with that, during summer break students can exercise that sense of independence by going out on their own. Generic_Name as so experienced with being independent that he had no problem when he moved out. Practicing independence can help with the future hardships students may face. An example of this is managing college and work. Student-designed projects can help in so many ways.

Although, many feel that students would get off track of what the project is meant to do and not know want to do without structure but, this would just promote the ability to think for their own. Promoting Creativity with student-designed project would increase the creativity of the student it would help problem solving. Passion can be created, where they care and have pride for something, through a student-designed project. A student-designed project can encourage students to be independent, building experience and practice doing so. Just letting the students decide will help them.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
6FD9C7865B56,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher designed or student designed? These summer projects should be teacher designed, because students may want to make simple projects without putting much effort into them. Students may not learn anything from their own projects, because they could just be copying and pasting from the internet. Teachers can also make a list telling the students what is required for the project, making the project more effective.

Making the summer projects teacher designed would be better than making summer projects student designed, because students may want to make simple projects, without putting much effort into the work. For example, if Generic_Name were to work on a project, during his summer break, Generic_Name would probably rush and put random things on his project in order to say that he has done the work, because he may have other priority's, such as going outside and playing a sport or going to the swimming pool. For sure, tons of other students would do the same as Generic_Name. This means that making summer projects student designed wouldn't be the most brilliant idea. Making summer projects teacher designed means, teachers would want to see some fantastic work, instead of some junk that students would do.

Students may not learn anything from their own projects, because they could just be copying and pasting information from the internet. That is plagirism, which is illegal to do and students can get into trouble for that and by the way, students are not learning. Therefore, summer projects being designed by teachers is a great idea, because teachers can assign the students ways to write, instead of copying and pasting, and teachers can make powerpoints of the instructions, that the students must follow. The way students can gain knowledge on what they've done is by reading reliable sites, based on the topics that the teacher has given them and summarizing what they have read and making sure it makes sense.

Teacher's can make list's of the requirements that the students must follow for their projects, making the project spicy. For example, the teacher can require the students to write a certain amount of paragraphs in their own words, joined with pictures that relate to the students work, and even data that the student would have to collect, making students experts that they could even present their work to hundreds of people. This means students would have to put in time and effort to make sure they have learned something during their summer break, instead of just spending time on their phones, playing games, and not doing anything productive. Meaning that the requirements that the teachers give to the students is a huge role on how the students final product is going to look like.

Therefore, schools requiring students to complete summer projects to assure learning during their break, should be teacher designed. This means that the teachers should create the way the summer project should be made. Students should take time out of their summer break to complete a project that is informing and can help them learn more. At last, summer projects should be teacher designed instead of student designed.          ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
8A3392CDCCF1,"Why are summer projects student-designed instead of being teacher-designed? They are designed for students to learn about a specific subject that could teach them about a lot of things that they haven't heard about before doing the project. Student-designed summer projects represents new information, the amount of time it has been worked on, and the possibility of helping the society. Summer projects will help a student during their summer break to keep learning new things in the world and develop facts about them.

Firstly, student-designed summer projects shows new information to students rather than a teacher. A teacher taught themselves to know the knowledge that a student would need in their future life, so making a project would increase the knowledge of a student. Projects during the summer break could actually help a student to remember everything that they learned and teach others about it to where people will learn new things in their life. When a student is able to give people details about what they learned during the summer, it would be added to the brain of the person to know what to do or how to do something. Information given from a student would stay in their mind for a long time to recollect, but a person will try to prove them wrong, so that they will get the point of the argument until the student is able to show the facts that they are the correct individual. Students collect facts of their subject and study them to show to the teacher of how much new information has helped them in knowing something they didn't know before working on the project.

Secondly, student-designed summer projects shows the amount of time the student has been working on making the project. Timing of a project can represent how determined a student wants to learn about a new subject, so they could use all of the facts and put it into their project. If a student is taking days to weeks to finish the project they are going to make a spectacular presentation to the students and the teacher that will give them an extra boost in their knowledge. A student that takes only a day to work on their project wouldn't care about the facts they learn, even though it is important to learn everything that they need to learn to be smarter with facts that could come in their future. It shouldn't take a long time for a student to work on their project and not finish it in time to where they don't have the information, and it will show how irresponsible the student can be of not working on their project.

The project should be filled with real information to where students can use it and transfer it to other students brain as they would have the possibility of taking a test or quiz on the information that was given to them. Testing or taking a quiz on a subject that the student have done a project on should be easy for all the students who learned a new fact.

Thirdly, student-designed summer project helps society to do better and not make it worse to where it will become a deserted area or bad society. A summer project about helping society would influence people to care for their society to always clean it instead of trashing the area making it look dirty that no one wants to come near it and help people, so that nothing bad will happen to their society and no one will make it a bad area. Society creates a place to where Americans can be comfortable around each other having them to express their emotions publicly and getting the attention of people to care about them. It also creates a space to where people wouldn't like it based on the people that lives there having it to be seen as a bad society that no one who wants to live in a good society would consider to live or visit in that area. Americans can help society from becoming a bad society and a deserted area by taking care of the area and citizens who are in need of help before they make the society to be bad. If the society becomes to be not a good society everyone who lived there would leave and decide to live in a bigger area that has a better society.

However, teacher-designed summer project will give the teacher the same information that they already knew before, but a student-designed summer project would actually teach the students new information of their subject during the summer. When a student is doing a project during the summer it would be intriguing to the students to keep learning and show everything they have in their brain to offer to other students improving their knowledge too. Teachers are able to learn the information as they study hard to give the students the same information, so a student should be able to do the same thing and achieve a better grade for their summer project. Student-designed summer projects can show their capability of getting the facts and information of their subject to where they would gain ideas on how to make their project connect to other students mindset on it.

In Conclusion, summer projects are required to be student-designed to help students to learn new information and develop facts in the world. It teaches the students new information, the amount of time the project has to be done, and a way of helping their society to know in their future life. Summer projects are a good requirement for students to learn new things during their summer break.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
1B13689BCDF1,"Over summer, many students are required to do a project pertaining to a specific class. The projects given, should be teacher-designed rather than the student creating his or her own idea. The project should be teacher-designed because the project gives an outline to the student on what will be taught that school year. It also helps the student determine officially, if he or she would like to stay in that specific class and as well as, express to the teacher on the type of student he or she will be, based on the effort given on the summer project. If teachers continue to design the projects, there will be more success within the classroom and the work ethic given by students.

When teachers give a summer assignment, the work given helps a student see the type of material he or she will be learning that year. The work comes to show how rigorous the class and classwork will be based off of the work load and in depth questions that the teacher has provided. With receiving an outline, it gives the overall idea of what to expect, so that the student can mentally prepare, for the upcoming year. When being able to prepare ahead of time, the student will be able to see the amount of work that might be given. Without the teacher-designed summer project, the student will be oblivious to what to expect in the class that they will be taking.

Continuing on, a teacher-designed project, helps express to the teacher on the type of student he or she will be receiving, based off of the effort given on the project. When a teacher designs a project, it is usually a reflection of how hard that specific class is and type of teacher he or she might happen to be. If the student happens to only complete the bare minimum or does not even try, it shows that, that student may not be best suit in that teacher's class. With the teacher giving a personal designed project, it shows which students have the initiative and will work hard on any assignment given, moving forward. The project overall gives a central idea to the teacher, on what he or she needs to expect during the future of the school year.

Many claim that not letting a student design their own project, takes away from his or her creativity and own personal ideas. However, the point of someone expressing creativity, is being able to take anything and make it their own. A student can still be creative and express themselves through the work given by the teacher. Having the ability to express his or her own ideas and meet the requirements, will stand out to any teacher evaluating it. Just because the range of ideas and creativity is limited when the student is not able to create his or her own project, does not mean creativity or personal ideas are completely shut out and prevented from being intertwined within the teacher's design.

Overall, having a teacher-designed project is more efficient and much more beneficial than one that is student-designed. When having a project designed by a teacher, it is a way for a student to see how hard and rigorous the class will be and the abundance of work that will be given throughout the rest of the school year. Not only that, but it as well gives teachers the overall idea on what will be expected of specific students and the standards that will need to be upheld the upcoming year. Without the teacher-designed projects, the students will not know what to complete a project on and will not be ready at all, for what they will be learning the upcoming year. Teacher-designed projects are a great idea and will be a great addition, for all students to have the ability to be prepared, for the upcoming school year.         ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
1C346211657F,"During the summer, students are given a plethora of work by their teacher for the upcoming school year to ensure that students are able to recall and apply their knowledge over the summer. Unfortunately, many of these projects and assignments are teacher-designed and lack the ability to properly ensure the retention of information over the summer. Instead, over-break projects should be student-designed as this would help students learn and memorize information better, make students have a more interactive experience, and make each student have a unique project based off their specific needs as a learner.

The unique nature of student-created assignments allows the student that creates their own project to have better retention of the material covered by the project due to a psychological concept using episodic memory. This psychological concept is a proven memory technique that uses personal experiences (episodic memories) as a link to the concept or term the individual is trying to learn and remember. This can easily be applied to the homework given over their break as when students design their own projects they are able to make mental links with the project components and the information they are doing a project on. These links allow them to be able to retain the information better as they have memory to draw back on when they think about the concept. Unlike this, however, teacher-designed projects have many students mindlessly doing their homework; thus, missing the connections with the experience and the concept. While, with student-designed projects they are forced to think about the concepts and project links as they create and complete the assignment.

Student-created projects also tend to be more interactive as it forces the student to engage with the project in through its interesting components. I have experiences with both sides of the argument as I am a high school student; this has caused me to partake in both teacher-made assignments and student-created projects. Overall, I have noticed that the teacher-made assignments tend to be more dry and more like busy work, rather than student-based assignments which are more interactive as they incorporate games, colorful activities and modern slang sprinkled throughout the assignment. This makes the work much more enjoyable for students as they are able to have fun doing the work. This also helps them retain information better as they are focusing on the work yet still enjoying it rather than mindlessly doing the work because you were told to do it. These fun, interactive activities are both fun for the user but also achieves the end goal of stimulating the student's knowledge over summer break.

While also interactive, student-created assignments are also unique to each student. Students understand their weakness and will be able to create a project that is catered to them and their specific strengths and weaknesses in order to better their current knowledge of the subject. For example, Generic_Name has trouble on cardiology for her AP Biology class; so for her project over the summer she focused on the anatomy of the heart and the blood circulation process of the human body. This allowed Generic_Name an opportunity to research and study cardiology and other heart-related processes, thus increasing her knowledge of her weakest subject within AP Biology. Therefore, every single student is given the opportunity to fix their individual flaws through these student-made projects. On the other hand, a standardized teacher-made assignment barely addresses their weaknesses. This is due to the fact that teacher-made assignments are generalized to all students and only brush the surface of every topic in order to cram all the information onto the one assignment. While conversely, student-made assignments are able to go deep into concepts the student struggles with due to the student being able to create the project.

Student-created projects have the ability to increase the knowledge of the material covered by the project, dramatically. It also gives the student a more pleasurable experience compared to a teacher-created assignment due to its interactive nature and more student catered experience through games and activities. However, the most important aspect of student-created projects is its ability to be a unique assignment that is perfectly created to address the needs and wants of that student as it is the student in question that is creating it. These three characteristics of student-created projects allows the student to grasp and retain the important information they need to learn and remember over the summer. It is my understanding that the student, the person who knows what they need to learn, should be given a project that caters to them and gives them the best opportunity to learn and remember information through a medium that allows them to understand the concept without getting bored of it. So why choose these standardized teacher-created assignments that are unable to meet the specific needs of its students? Why not go for the better option that allows students to flourish in their own creative and unique way? ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
9CFB3963E24C,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects...should these projects be teacher-designed or student designed? Summer is a moment that shouldn't be taken away by work. As a student it;s best for summer break projects to be designed by students. Although some may disagree that student-designed projects are effective; with a student-designed project time management can develop, more relate-able projects and creativity can be produced, and principals of cooperation/social skills can be established.

Firstly, time is just as potent as life itself. As an adult time management is key in the world of work. However, the younger generations of students, and children do not process this until later in life. The time difference in constructing, doing, and presenting a project can be comparable to real world activities such as: writing a report with a crunched due date, getting to a destination in a reasonable amount of time, utilizing and enhancing a persons' morning routine to get out the house more early, and many more real world tasks. Time is just as important as breathing everyday, and with having student-designed projects, students can gain these experiences at an early age; with replication, the success rate of younger adults will increase.

Secondly, doing the same activities every year such as: large research papers, extensive PowerPoint, and book reports can be repetitive; especially during summer vacation when both students and teachers alike get a break from the constant working. Students designing projects can prove beneficial; however, not only to the students themselves but teachers and even the environment along side. The creative factor in a simple project can increase for example, a science study project that involves a class taking a trip to a zoo or animal shelter for studies. Giving the class a opportunity to decide on summer projects can also tie into the immersion of summer vacation. Instead of being that book report, a person can interview others who like or dislike the book and gain criticism, knowledge, and information from a vast prospective. Not only with creativity, having the ability to relate to the student can be a opportunity to increase overall contribution of students in projects over the summer.

In addition, communication is important and a staple point in our economy. Allowing students to design summer projects can put the basic skills of cooperation and socialization to use. Understanding and accepting cooperation can place a person in a better position in life than someone who refuses to cooperate with others. And cooperation is needed life after high school examples such as: getting assistance on business, buying objects such as houses and a vehicle, working along side coworkers you don't like. Along with aiding the understanding of cooperation student-designed projects can be helpful for those who have trouble with socializing, anxiety for example. Placing a person within a group of like minded people with goal in mind can give one the opportunity to get assistance with anxiety and communication blocks throughout life.

It is often argued that having teachers to designate projects can be more beneficial than having students do the task. Certainly there are those who claim teachers are more experienced, well organized, and can provide more clarification on requirements for the task at hand. However, role reversal and having the students design the projects can result in more creative ideas, have individuality or unique portrayals of each separate idea, and a overall better interest in the project itself. As a result this side is more effective because you can gain more interactions within the targeted group, more interest in the assignment as a whole, and lower levels of stress weighing on a person or group.

As we have seen the argument of whether students or teachers should be designated to design projects runs on; having students design projects can be more of an improvement than a teacher. Simultaneously a teacher can gain more interest and interaction in the overall class, and boost the basic core skills of time management and cooperation. Not only strengthening a persons' individual skills but a persons skills to interact with the world after high school.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9EBE1DC9D4A7,"Students are like baby chickens. They need a leader and proper guidance to ensure they prosper in life. Teachers can be and usually are that mother hen for their students. This applies to many circumstances whether it is in school, during the summer, or even after college. Planning projects in the summer, a perfect time for students to grow and expand their knowledge, is an area that most teachers are experts on. Some people may say projects given during the summer should be designed by the students. However, summer projects should be teacher-designed because students cannot be held accountable and need guidance.

Summer projects should not be student-designed because students are not trustworthy. The majority of students will search for an easy way out and try to make the project as simple as possible. This is completely divergent to a teacher's mindset. They enjoy pushing students out of their comfort zone so they have a better chance to improve and grow. Students cannot be held accountable to design a summer project that will challenge their mind because of their lack of motivation. In addition, students are not responsible enough to be bestowed with the task of creating their own project. Without a doubt, they will prioritize relaxation and fun over learning and hard work, especially in the summer. As a repercussion, it is a waste of time for the student and teacher, since the student did not put forth their best effort. Some people may say students should create their own summer projects so they can take the initiative and learn to be independent. However, they are wrong because students cannot be held accountable for their actions due to their lazy mentalities. Teachers benefit from challenging students, which is why teacher-designed summer projects ensure that students continue to learn.

Another reason teachers should design summer projects is because most students still need assistance and guidance. Teachers are more experienced in life and share their wisdom with children. Nevertheless, they know what activities and projects stimulate the brain and help students learn better. With this additional knowledge, they are better suited to plan and organize projects. For many students, their brain continues to develop and their pre-frontal cortex develops last. As a result, they rely on their amygdala, which is why they do not have the best decision making skills. When asked to create a project, some students do not know where to start because they need guidelines to accomplish a task. For this reason, teachers are always there to help and give guidance. They look out for their students and give encouragement because they want what is best for them. Many people say that schools should give students permission to design summer projects as a way to give them more freedom and allow them to express their creativity. Although, they are incorrect because students still need guidance since they do not have as much experience compared to adults and for the reasont that their brains are still developing.

Clearly, summer projects should be teacher-designed due to the lazy mentalities and ongoing brain development of students. Children cannot be trusted to create their own project because they will not challenge themselves enough, especially compared to a teacher. Students still require guidance because their brain is still developing and teachers provide beneficial wisdom. It is essential that these projects stimulate the brain so student continue to learn over summer. Without a doubt, teachers should definitely create summer projects because if they didn't, students might be robbed of a prosperous future. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
AEEEFCE714A1,"Most students in school are assigned summer projects so that they continue to learn over their two month summer break. Some of these projects can be dreadful and tedious, and others can be fun and exciting. The main goal of the projects is for students to continue learning over their summer break. Usually, when students don't learn, they have a hard time adjusting to the new school year which can immensely hurt their grades. These summer projects can be designed by the teachers or the students. Summer assignments should be student-designed because students know which projects are interesting and they know how their peers learn and think, which can help the students better learn from the assigned projects.

Summer projects should be student-designed because students know which projects other students will find interesting. If summer projects are boring and tedious, students won't want to learn anything. If they do things that are more fun and involving then they will definitely learn more and better, which is the entire purpose of assigning summer projects. When teachers assign projects, most of the time they aren't as fun because the teachers just want to get the point across and in the end hope that the students understand. When the students design the project, they know for certain that the students will learn from them because they themselves are students. Teachers may assign packets of worksheets or book reports that need to be completed by the beginning of the school year. However, when you ask students to fill out a packet, they don't really learn anything because frankly it's not that interesting. If students design the projects, they might have the students do an experiment that involves them more so that they can learn better. They might also design projects where students can work together on an experiment, and when two minds work on something, it always leads to better acquisition of the information. Collaborating with others is also a great way to learn, especially over the break,

Another reason why students should design summer assignments is because students know how their peers think and learn whilst on break, which also leads back to interesting projects the students will design. When students design the projects they think of what their classmates find interesting and it can be easier for them because they are students themselves. In other words, because they are students themselves, they know which projects to assign because they will find them interesting. Sometimes when teachers design projects they think it's interesting when they're actually not. In order to make sure they are fun, it's best to have students design the projects. When students are on break they don't want to learn from a packet of worksheets, they want to learn from fun experiments and activities. One time, my teacher designed a summer project and she thought it was an exciting experiment, but she didn't realize that the experiment was actually really long and complicated for the students. We were also on break and couldn't ask her because she didn't respond to anyone's emails. When you need clarification on a student-designed project you can easily ask them because you know where and who they are.

Some say that teacher-designed projects are the best because the teachers know what the students need to learn, especially for the coming year. Even though this may be partly true, the teachers can easily let the students, who are designing the projects, know what the students should learn from the projects and go from there. Students will have a better clue on what the projects need to be about and can make it interesting for the students, so that they continue to learn over their break. If students design the experiments, they can make sure the experiments aren't complicated or tedious either.

In conclusion, student-designed projects are much better for students to continue learning over the summer break. Students will better learn the important information if the projects are interesting and well thought out, which the students know how to do. Students should also design the experiments because they know which projects are interesting and know how their will classmates learn from them. When projects are fun, the students will retain the information better and will allow them to learn over their two month summer break. Summer projects don't need to be boring packets of worksheets, they can be experiments and other activities that stimulate the students' brains in order for them to continue learning. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
C00C50C17BD3,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure we continue learning during break. Should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? As a student, I strongly believe that the summer projects should be student-designed. Even though teachers will disagree, they're wrong! When a student gets to choose what he or she does for their project, I know that we'll have more fun completing it and we'll be given the chance to become more creative than what a teacher would make us do.

Summer break is suppose to be fun. If a teacher gave us a project, we'd be sitting at home, all alone, inside reading about a great adventure, when we could be having our own! Instead of writing a boring paper, with no enthusiasm, about someone else experience, we could have the chance to go out and make our own. Then, the paper would be full of passion. I would rather design my own project that would not only make my teachers happy, but will let me have fun while completing it!

Another great reason students should design their summer project, is because is gives us the chance to become creative. Creativity inspires us to thrive and do our best. For example, a few years ago I was told to come up with a way to show how bullying can change ones life. I had a great idea! I went around the school and asked ten people if they were ever bullied. If they said yes, I asked them how it changed their life, or if it even did. I wrote down everything they said, and decided to make a short play. The play was about a little girl who was bullied her entire life, and the things she stopped doing because of the bullies. The play showed everything the teacher wanted to know and more! I loved doing that project, and to this day I will never forget how proud I was and how much fun I had doing it! It gave me the chance to explore my creativity. I wish i could get the chance to do it again!

I understand schools want us to continue to learn during our break, but that's why we should have fun while doing it! A student-designed project gives us the chance to have fun, make our own experiences and explore our creativity! When a student enjoys doing the project the outcome, or grade, will become a lot better. This is why I believe the student-designed projects would be better than any teacher-designed project. It gives us a chance to grow, not only as a student, but as a person too!",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
1D4FFD3360DA,"I think Summer projects should be teacher designed rather than leaving the student to their own devices. For reasons like having an idea already set for the students, making it so the students don't get too lost, and if the teacher came up with the topic for the project then there's be more summer than work stuffs.

Now then, when an idea is already laid out for someone, it becomes faster for then to think of more ideas from the base of the first example. For book reports and the like, its already hard because you have to choose from a list of books that you probably don't want to read,* but it gives you a bit of simpleness to get to choose a book that is meant to be read during summer.

Now comes the topic of getting lost within your own thought as you try to think of an idea that wasn't preset for you already. Getting lost is inevitable in some cases, but when there's no prompt to start you off, it becomes a lot harder to follow up with good ideas.

When it's the teacher or school that comes up with essay prompts, you'll have a much easier time since it saves up time from your summer. Book report prompts are usually made so that they're going to take a while before you finish them; but since those all have prompts already set by the school, they don't take as long as they would.

The question that this prompt asks is vague as it is, but the fact that I wrote this much based off of that makes it seem less vague and more just difficult to interpret. Summer projects being teacher designed is what all students have gotten used to at this point in time; and it would be wrong to switch it up on the next generation of students to make them come up with their own ideas from nothing to base them off of.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
A82299609B1F,"As a child, usually in summer you are assigned a summer book assignment or any task to keep your brain working over the summer. Many children complain about this and say it is pointless and would prefer to do there own projects and not ones assigned to them by teavchers. They feel as if it would be much easier and would not have to do as much work. But, teachers knowwing topics for kids to work on, them knowing requirements and what thy NEED to lear, and pushing the students by giving them not easy tasks shows that teachers should be the ones designing summer projects

Teachers got to where they are in life and there career from one very huge cause, knowing what they are teaching and talking about to students. There whole jobs purpose iis to understand topics and briefly explain them to students, They spend years learning so much so they have so much more experience on topics and what would challenge students and help them grow. While some people may think students do know topics very well and would e able to challenge themselves, teachers give everyone that extra oush which is much needed because at the end of the day they just want to see all of their students succeed.

Along ith teachers knowing what to teach students and how to explain it to them, they also know what requirements are needed for projects and wgat students need to do to be able to get good grades. Rubics tae several days to be created, sometimes teachers caan not do it alone they go over it with there peers. They do this to help students be strong and do good on there assignemnts to show that if they work hard they will rcieve a fair grade for the amount of work they put in. Even though some students may make requirements hard so they can push themselves, many would also try to make it as easy as possible so they do't have to spend tht much time on it and enjoy there summer. Teachers make requirements that are not extreme but they are necessary so students do not slack and if they choose to there grade will show it.

Many teachers have multpile years of experience and have seen so many of there former students take so many different paths in life. Teachers try there absolute hardest to push students to help them grow and becoe mature and responsible young men and women. Because even though it may seem like they do not care what happens to you, they do bcause they have a huge impact on your life. As one of my teachers had said, the hardest thing about teaching is seeing someone not come out of there lass to do good with there lives, they push each and every student in hopes that they will encourage them to succeed and drive in life to be succcesful. Some students may think that there teacher doe not care, but they do and they try to ush you mentaly to try to make you stronger.

Very many students would love to create there own work fo them to do over the summer. Some may say it ill be easier for them to create there own work because they know how far to push themselves. But, teachers knowing topics better than students, knowing specific requirements needed, and the, pushing students past there limit to try to help them grow shows why TEACHERS should be the ones designing summer assignments. That is why i believe teachers should create summer assignments and not students         ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
A10F4BAEA92D,"Over Summer break, certain students are required to complete projects to ensure that they're learning during their time off of school. Summer projects are quite beneficial to students; they allow students to become more knowledgeable about a subject during the process of completion. Although, a few factors should be considered when creating them. These types of projects should be designed by teachers since they're aware of the curriculum, it'll avoid students from making it too easy, and it could potentially benefit the students.

When teaching, the teachers must teach according to the school's curriculum. They also have a complex understanding of the material that they share with their students. With this knowledge, they'll know what to include when designing the projects. Not only do these assignments encourage the students to learn, but some teachers assign these projects based on the new material they'll be learning when they come back. Therefore, they will be prepared for the new unit when it's introduced to them at school.

A majority of students come to school prepared and eager to learn. The rest of those students are typically known to be lazy or carefree when it comes to schoolwork. If they get the opportunity to design a summer project, some of them might take a shortcut, which may defeat the purpose of the project. Without authority, numerous students obtain the idea to go after something they normally wouldn't go for if they had a sense of authority. Some will put in zero to no effort into designing the projects.

The purpose of assigning these projects to students is to ensure that they keep learning. Certain students won't gain much knowledge if they're not given the right tools to learn. Another factor that comes into play is that kids sometimes feel pressured when a teacher expects them to fulfill something. Sometimes they need a sense of direction when they're clueless about what to do; lack of direction may sometimes lead to confusion.

With these reasons in mind, teachers should design summer assignments for their students, instead of the other way around. Students will be ready to absorb more knowledge and will be able to understand the material in a deeper meaning. Overall, teachers know what's best for their students. If the projects are done in an organized manner, this may guarantee success into a student's school career.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
5A014068C6F1,"At a lot of schools summer projects are not given, but at some they are and they are given vigorously. If over the summer projects are given, they should be student-designed for many reasons. First off, letting a teacher decide what the students will do over summer will not only make the kids mad, it will also cause them to be less engaged with the topic and assignment. If the school allows the children to pick their topic, they will be more engaged because they are creating their own work from the bottom up. This will be more fun for the students and they will be more likely to complete the project. Summer projects should be student-designed to be fair to the kids, to make it more fun for the students, and to also further engage children with their work.

The first reason to why summer projects should be student-designed is because that is the only way that it will be fair to the students. Kids will be able to choose what they want and start their own creation from scratch. Giving the students the same topic by the teacher will put some at a disadvantage. Some are not likely to complete the assignment because they do not want to do the topic assigned, and some will also not be comfortable with competing against their higher academically sound classmates. Another reason kids should be able to pick their own topics is because a lot of schools do not do summer projects in the first place. This is just to be fair to the class. Let them pick their own topics, do not add on to the kids' disengagement by telling them what they are going to do. It will also be easier for the kids to complete the assignment if they are able to choose it themselves. For example, this past semester, my history professor assigned my classmates and me a project about the history of the United States. Each student had the exact same topic and that made it very stressful. We all were trying to search the same things, and it sure made it harder to find the information when the teacher assigns a tough topic. Then on the other hand, this semester my professor has allowed each of us to pick our own topic. It has created a lot less stress and it is easier to find information on the topic when we are able to search it and find what we need. So, to be fair, let the students pick the topics of their choice and there will be a better outcome.

The second reason of why the projects should be student designed is so that it will be fun for the kids. The students should be able to pick a fun topic of their choice, and not a rigorous topic that their professor assigns. This causes the students to be able to pick a more personal or relatable topic to them, that they then will want to complete. Letting children choose their topics will also assure that each project is different and that there is no way for them to cheat. When each student chooses their own topic, there will be color and diversity to each project. This will then make it easier to grade for the teachers. If each student had the same topic, it would be harder on the teacher to grade because they would be looking at the same thing for every student. It will be fun for them just like the students because they will be able to see what is going on in their students' minds, and how creative they can be. So, students should be able to pick their own summer project to make it more diverse and fun.

The third topic adds on to the first two, and that is when the students are allowed to pick their own topic, they will be more engaged with their work.

There will be more diversity and intensity among the work, A student will want to complete their work, because it actually means something and can be personal or emotional to them. Assigning the sudents a project based off of what the teacher wants is not smart. The professor should be able to come up with what the criteria requires, but let the students pick so they can be engaged. Students can also create some competition amongst themselves when they are able to choose their own topic. They will compete to see who can create the best work and see which one their teacher will like the most. Their minds will be able to explore and their work will represent how they feel and what the project meant to them.

In conclusion, letting students pick the topic of their summer projects will have many benefits for the students and even the teachers. It will be more fun to the students and teachers. The students are able to let their minds explore and they are able to be engaged with the work that they have created. It will also be fun for the teachers because their grading will not be as tough and boring. With each student, they are able to see something new and what their students have thought of. There are no real disadvantages of this, as long as students stay in the guidelines of what they are supposed to do. And, that should be no problem if the students know exactly what to do. Summer projects are already enough of a hassle for the kids, so let them choose their own topics to be fair, fun, and create more engagement within the classroom. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
0AE484ECECE6,"Most students, strongly dislike summer assignments, because when school is over we want to relax and enjoy our time off. But, what we don't realize is that these summer projects can be very helpful in the future. Once we go back to school, and as we get older and closer to graduate we try taking difficult and more advanced classes to bump our gpa. To be in these classes, most of the time, teachers assign summer assignments to give the students an idea of how the class is going to be and the certain skills you need to maintain to be in that class. I believe that these projects should be teacher-designed because the teachers already know what the standards are in that class, and what objectives you need to be familiar with before coming into that class. Also, if a student were to design the summer projects, they might make it easy for their fellow peers and not work at their full potential.

I believe that teachers should design the summer projects because they know what can benefit you as a student and want to see you succeed as much as possible. One reason why I think teachers should design the summer projects is that the teachers already learned the subjects they are teaching. So, they could create a summer project that could help the students understand the material the teachers struggled with learning when they were once students. Another reason why I think the summer projects should be teacher designed, is because the teachers probably have taught the class before and know what topics you need to be familiar with when you arrive to that class. Also, the teachers have had experiences with students in the past and know what skills and work ethic you need to succeed in that class. In my opinion I think that students required to complete the summer projects would be better off if it were designed by a teacher.

If the summer projects were designed by the students I feel like the students wouldn't make it as challenging as the teachers would. I feel like the students wouldn't work to their full potential since they know the teacher didn't design the project. As a student, I think that sometimes we try to find an easy way out to complete an assignment and I think that the students would make the project not as challenging and in the future that could affect how we would do in the class and the easy project would reflect on our grade if we dont know the full material. Also I think that the students might not know the criteria as well as the teachers do, to assign a project on it.

Overall, I think that the teachers should be the ones to design the summer projects because they have the experience and the students could ask them questions if they need to involving the project. The students would defiantly benefit from the teachers designing the project because it would give them an idea on how the class would be like in the next school year and would prepare them to strive in their classes. On the other hand, if the students were to design the summer projects they wouldn't know what topics to include, unlike the teachers that have had experiences with other kids completing their assignments in the past. In conclusion, I think that the students would be better off if the projects were teacher-designed. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
E71176878741,"It is a common occurrence for teachers to assign work over the summer. There are many reasons for this, the most prominent being to keep students refreshed and ready for school and new classes after a long break. Many argue that the responsibility for the creation of these assignments should belong to the students, while others argue that the teachers should have the control in these assignments. The ones who should be responsible for the creation of these assignments is the teachers for a multitude of reasons, the main ones being that teachers have a better understanding of the next years content, they understand the skill level of the class as a whole much better than the students, and students can and will get lazy with assignment creation intending to slack off.

The purpose of school is for students to learn new things and gain a more advanced thinking process, the point of the summer assignments is to prepare students for the new things they will be learning. The implications of this are that, if students made these assignments, they would not be able to prepare themselves for the next year and for what they don't know about. On the other hand teachers have gone to specialized college classes to teach their respective subjects and have a much deeper understanding of what it is they have to teach. These qualities allow them to best determine what a student must know and remember for the next year, because a student who doesn't know physics can't properly prepare themselves for a physics class. Vice verse a teacher who has a degree in physics knows exactly what they want their students to know and remember when they enter their class.

Another reason in favor of having teachers create the summer assignments is the fact that they know their classes better than any singular student does. This ties in with how students don't know what is coming the next year in the way that the teacher has the most knowledge on what the class as a whole struggles on the most and therefore, can form assignments around this. While a group of friends can have knowledge on what each other struggles with they don't know about the rest of the class in the way teachers do. A teacher has access to all tests, quizzes, and basic assignments from their class, this information is not privy to the students and therefore a student can never truly understand what is needed in these assignments.

The final reason for summer assignment creation to be put in the hands of the student is the common laziness and apathy that many students face. One simple sounding solution to the problem above would be to have each individual student make their own assignment with a check done by the teacher. The problem with this is if an individual student is given the choice to make their own assignments many will choose something much easier than necessary and not get the proper education benefits from the assignment. Then, if everything about the assignment must be checked by the teacher anyways it only gives the illusion of choice. In actuality while the students may have different assignments from each other it is no different from the teacher just giving the students a more specialized assignment seeing as the teacher will make the changes to it they need anyways. Since this is not giving the students the true ability to make their own assignments the power is now in the teacher's hands. Therefore, if students are given true control of their assignments, they will always look for an easy way to increase their grade with the least effort, this is why teachers are given responsibility over the students. If responsibility was removed students wouldn't learn in school and assignments would almost never benefit the students.

In conclusion while there can be an argument for students creating assignments, if the choice must be black or white, the teachers should have the responsibility of creating summer assignments. The reasons being that teachers have more knowledge of a given subject and a deeper understanding of students, while the prevalence of apathy in students harms their case. While in actuality the best choice would be one of compromise in which both students and teachers get choice, the teachers should always have the majority of choice in the assigning of almost all work pertaining to school not just summer assignments, or else there is no purpose of school in the first place. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9497EEBD96C5,"For most students, summer is a time of freedom and relaxation; unless, of course, they're given a teacher-designed summer project. As a young learner, I can tell you truthfully that being assigned a summer project is absolutely heart-wrenching. Imagine enjoying your amazing summer and you realize half way through it that you have a summer project due; and if you're anything like me, you'll still find yourself procrastinating on it as the thick assignment haunts you over your shoulder with every fun summer adventure you experience. Don't get me wrong, summer projects can be extremely helpful; however, the stress that comes with them can be avoided if the assignments were student-designed. That way, the work can be personalized to improve the learners' problem areas and fit into their summer plans.

Students know what they struggled with while school was in session; they were in those classrooms learning it and trying to understand it the best they could all year. Therefore, they have the ability and information to design a summer project that allows them to learn and improve in whatever topic they had trouble with by putting it together in sections. Perhaps their problem areas were small parts of units. For example: ""unit 4, 2.1a"". If that's the case, they could include that portion in the assignment to help them practice. If that's not the case and they simply just didn't understand an entire unit, they could sum up the lesson and include those factors as well. This allows them to learn and practice so they can be the best student they possibly could during break.

As I said before, summer is a time of freedom and relaxation; however, us young ones have to keep learning or else we'd lose our scholar touch. So, the student-designed summer project could be broken up by months; this is an acceptable way to help learners keep track of their summer work because not only does it allow them to set aside free time for their break, it also helps them make a reserved time for assignments. That way, kids can still enjoy their break while keeping those learning juices flowing. This working format may even help uplift stress because when students see a big project that's nothing but work and no sections, they start to feel under pressure and might even begin to procrastinate. This event has happened to me countless of times; I see the task, get overwhelmed, and procrastinate. Although I am guilty of being a bit of a bad student because of this, I know good and well that sectioning work into months is a much better way to handle the load.

Opponents may claim that because they don't want to work over summer, the young learners will make it ridiculously easy for themselves so they can have a relaxing break. This is a valid point, however, us students just want to improve ourselves. It can be embarrassing to lack understanding of what's going on in the classroom; it can also make students feel like failures, or even feel stupid. I know from personal experience that school leaves majority of the kids feeling like the most idiotic person alive; but that just motivates them to do more to improve so they won't think down on themselves. That is where the student-designing comes into play; if they made it too easy for themselves, they wouldn't be improving. If they're not improving, the continuous cycle of feeling like an idiot will not end.

In conclusion, students know what is needed for them to thrive in their academics and they're willing to have open arms to allow that to happen. With the assignments being by students, for students, they are designed specifically to help them achieve the hardships of assignments and to come back to school with their brains running, in school mode, and ready to learn. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
67BBF262FE34,"Some schools have these dreadful summer projects that students don't really enjoy to do. However, it's required in most schools, regardless if it's a reading assignment or a history assignment. The school system just wants us to keep our brains going during the break. Now here comes the big question of the day, should the projects be teacher-designed or student-designed ? When this was first brought to my attention I would have said student-designed .Now that I have put further thought into it . I feel that it should be teacher-designed and student based. What I mean by that is students should have a big role in how teachers design it, so that students would be eager to do them ,and have a good challenge on their hands. Nevertheless it should be fun and educational.

Students count down until summer break and not just in ''

Highschool Musical''

either they can't wait to hangout with their friends, be out all night, and not have to wake up for school. Students know it's always that boring assignment that they have to complete over summer , which they wait the last minute to do. If the assignment was student based which mean it would have been appealing to to them, then they wouldn't wait all summer to do. It wouldn't just be a bunch of confused, nonintrested students putting anything down on a piece of paper just so they can get a grade. Some people might not agree and say an assignment is an assignment it has to get done regardless. However I myself am a student and I know once students get an assignment that they are eager to do your probably going to get their best work yet.

Everyone loves a good challenge especially a student. I know I do, and so does my peers. Students love an interesting challenge that will have them using their brains. The whole purpose of the summer project is to assure that students learn over the summer. What a better way to do it then by finding out what interest the students and challenge them to lean more about it , rather its for History class or English ,or in the format of a poster board project or an essay project. An educational challenge is always a good challenge because 1 it teaches students not to give up 2 that there is always more to learn.

I understand that theres going to be an assignment due at the beginning of each school year. However, if it is teacher-designed and student based schools will have an outstanding out come because the more the students are eager to learn , the challenges get harder, and the harder it gets .The more students learn how to succeed in life after high school probably before they reach high school or the 12th grade for that matter. Summer projects are for the students to learn more an as long as it is teacher designed and student based the school system will have a greater impact on our lives.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
5816447F692C,"Many students across the country can relate to the struggle of returning to school at the end of summer and attempting to complete a review packet, only to realize that, over summer break, they had forgotten what they learned. To prevent his from occurring, schools have began to assign summer work to students. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they continue learning during their break. However, students often times find these teacher-designed and regulated projects boring and tedious. These summer projects should be student-designed to increase student interest and motivation while they work on this mandatory project, and to teach students how to be independent researchers, allowing them to continue learning during their break and providing them with the ability to pursue the topic if desired.

If a student had the ability to design their own summer projects, it would not only increase the student's rate of productivity, it would also increase the quality of the results. In addition, a student's desire in researching their topic will allow them to retain this knowledge and continue learning during their break. Students often groan at the idea of completing a mandatory project, whether it is in-school or out of school. Furthermore, teacher-designed topics fail to provide students with the ability to research a topic that they are interested in. This depletes a student's desire to complete the assigned summer project. Students would find summer projects more enjoyable if they had the ability to design their project and chose their topic. This would, in turn, increase the students' motivation and desire to conduct the project. Furthermore, the more time and energy that a student puts into their project, the better the overall quality of the project and of the results. This would occur if a student had the desire to do the project, which stems from the student's interest in the project. For example, many students across the United States complete an in-school science-project. This can be compared to a summer project because it has a similar process. First, students are either assigned a science topic by a teacher or they are told to chose a topic based on given criteria. Based on first-hand experience and student feedback, students enjoy conducting and completing the project if they had a choice of picking the prompt. This is because the students are able to choose a topic that interests them instead of being forced to research a topic that they are uninterested in. In turn, the quality of the science projects also improves in student picked topics due to the fact that students have a desire to spend more time on them.

Allowing students to design their own projects teaches them how to be independent researchers and promotes creativity by forcing students to plan procedures for a project. When teachers design projects for students, they include everything: topic, materials, time line, and procedure. The student rarely has to conduct any planning before completing the project. This takes away the research and the independence aspect of a project. The teachers babies the students through the process and fails to teach them how to decide the procedure, time line, and materials on their own. If a student isn't given the chance to plan out their own project, they will never learn how to. Planning also promotes and excersizes students' creativity. They are able to find new, creative procedures to tackle a project. As stated previously, students have more desire in researching topics that they are interested in. Student-designed projects would promote advanced and in-depth research among students. As a result students exercise independent research skills, which provides students the with the skills to continue research and promotes continuous learning.

Few may argue that students cannot be trusted in designing a project that is relevant to the curriculum and that allows for students to learn at the same time. Furthermore, students may be inclined to design a project that is too simple for them. This may easily be countered by the teacher. Just because students would be able to design their projects, doesn't mean that the teacher doesn't oversee their actions. Traditionally, when students are given an in-class assignment to design their own projects, their ideas must be approved by a teacher. The teacher also provides the students with guidelines to center their project topic around. This process would be the same for a summer assignment. Before school lets out, students would show the teacher their project plan and confirm that it follows the guidelines while being challenging enough for students. This allows for the students to enjoy their project and learn at the same time. Few may also argue that allowing the students to design their summer projects would result in mad time management since students would also control when certain tasks may need to be completed. Teachers also have the ability to counter this by providing a calender for when certain parts of the project need to be turned in. One teacher would assign a summer project with the same guidelines for a whole class, which allows for the projects to have fairly similar requirements. This makes it easy for a teacher to create certain turn-in dates throughout the summer. Implementing turn-in dates would decrease the students' ability to procrastinate and forces them to manage their time wisely.

Summer-projects are an excellent way for students to continue to learn over break while enjoying themselves. They are also a variation in school work as they provide more freedom and flexibility than in-class work. Consequentially, summer projects should be student-designed to increase student interest and motivation in the project, which allows them to care about the quality of research and work that they conduct.              ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
A5159F0C191D,"If there's one thing all students can agree on, it's that summer is the best time of the year. We can also agree that having to complete work assigned over the summer is the worst. Instead of staying home and doing a math worksheet for hours, most students would rather be lying on a beach. Summer gives kids the chance to get a break from the stress that comes with school and having to spend free time doing assignments they don't enjoy. Some schools have started implementing projects assigned to students for them to complete over summer break. These can either be teacher-designed or student-designed, which creates controversy. I believe that schools that require summer projects should be student-designed in order to build creative skills, allow students to explore their interests, and experience more responsibility.

A lot of students often feel stuck when it comes to working on school projects with specific guidelines and topics. Instead, these summer projects would let kids be creative in what they'd like to complete it on. It's very important for students to learn how to be creative, which many jobs need in the future. In the past, some of my favorite projects I've done were the ones where I got to have total control on what it was on. It allowed me to use my creativity for something different and helped me strengthen those skills. Students need to learn how to use their creativity to create a project to better prepare themselves for skills needed in different fields of work. Letting students explore their creativity also helps them enjoy completing these summer projects more. I feel that whenever I'm assigned something over the summer, I dread doing it and then end up finishing it at the last minute. If I had more control over a project assigned to me over the summer, I would have a much easier time completing it. Kids don't like to be constantly restricted, so letting them have creative control over a school project would result in better work. By giving students creative freedom over summer projects, they're able to strengthen their creativity and make a better project overall.

For most students, we don't usually get to choose which classes interest us the most until middle school. Student-designed summer projects allows us to explore things we're more interested in than what we learn in school. I've found myself feeling trapped in a class that I absolutely hate, which makes it much harder for me to do well in that class. When I get to use what I'm interested in to create something like a project, it's a lot easier for me to feel motivated to do so. In middle school, we had to make PSA projects for a couple different classes, which allowed us to choose a topic we like. I chose to do one of mine of adopting dogs instead of buying dogs, and I ended up getting an A on it since it was something I was really interested in researching and informing others of. Students want to learn more about topics that aren't taught in school and these student-led projects will let them do just that. Teachers can expected to receive much better work on projects that students are actually interested in, rather than a boring or confusing topic. This can also help student discover new things that they enjoy that they would've never found out about if they hadn't be assigned the project. New discoveries are beneficially to students who struggle with what they enjoy while trying to think about their future. Students enjoy getting to explain some of the things they find interesting in the form of projects.

Many students are faced with responsibility everyday, but if they have to create their own unique project, they get to experience responsibility that isn't always available to them. Students can learn how to be responsible by experiencing it from something they enjoy. A project that they can design is the perfect opportunity to explore responsibility. Doing those PSA projects was helpful for me because I dealt with the responsibility of completing the project better than I had before. I felt that coming up with my PSA wasn't a chore, but rather something I actually enjoyed. These projects can help teach students that responsibility isn't always something that has to be dreaded or feared. Responsibility can help build character and maturity. Student-designed projects allow students to learn that responsibility can be enjoyable too.

The introduction of summer projects in schools should be student-designed so students can be more creative, learn about new things, and learn how to be responsible. Many could argue that letting students create their own projects gives them false hope that most projects will be the same, but they also let kids experience individualism. Teachers would still have to put some restrictions in order to keep them appropriate and give a standard set of guidelines on what the materials should include. Letting students design their own summer projects helps them grow as they get older to help them for their futures. Many teachers should consider assigning fun projects instead of worksheets over the summer in order to get the best results from students. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
47665200B19C,"I was planning a project with a group of friends for our Spanish class it was dreadful. The teacher had given us another boring topic none of us were even close to interested about, we did the bare minimum yet still had achieved a solid high grade. And in little to no time we all had already completely forgotten about the topic. School summer assignments should be student, not teacher based because Freedom promotes curiosity, Students will work harder for something they care about and Freedom provides creativity.

First of all Freedom promotes curiosity, for example my mother is a famous singer here in the United States, every year Genric_City invites her to sing the national anthem and at my house we have medals and awards on every wall, my dad is a very talented guitarist who has been playing since he was six. Although they have always loved music they never pushed or forced us to try music for me and my little brother. My little brother got completely sucked into music and started teaching himself how to play the guitar, his curiosity is what led him where he is today. My little brother has been playing for less than a year and a half and has already played with my mom in concerts with up to five thousand people. My parents had very little to no influence to my brother because they never forced us to play. Some may believe otherwise because they might say freedom is what makes kids or teens rebellious and that thinking is reasonable but flawed due to the fact that being a bit rebellious is what gives kids or teens life experience. Albert Einstein one of the smartest men there have ever stepped foot on our planet was rebellious and would rarely attend class because his curiosity and freedom are what drove him.

Secondly, Students will work harder for the things they want and are interested in. If you have interest and motivation in something it will drive you not only to finish faster but to want to learn more. We always hear the phrase ""When you get a job pick something you will love to do the rest of your life"" otherwise your time is wasted and you are just stuck on a dead end job and doing tasks you have no interest in. My uncle Genric_Name always wanted to have his very own restaurant because he loved to cook and it was one of his hobbies but my grandpa has always forced and pushed him into taking law because in south America, which is where they live, he was very strict because he wanted to have his son have a well respected job title but soon enough the years passed and he realized he as stuck at an office when all he wanted to do was leave and open his restaurant. Not long after that he quit his office job and opened his very own restaurants where he is today. Some may disagree with this idea because they think you can adapt or get used to liking something but that reasoning is flawed to the fact that some people simply never adapt or get used to something they dont enjoy doing. For Example Gareth Bale a famous soccer player from Wales plays for Real Madrid a muti-million euro Spanish soccer club where he gets paid thousands of euros and has a full career but when Bale is injured he goes to play professional golf he loves soccer but he never got used to playing only soccer he also considered quitting the Spanish club only to go play soccer but he untimely stayed in soccer, even though if he quit he would of not only lost alot of money but he would have sacrificed it to do something he enjoys and that is worth respecting.

Another reason that school summer projects should be student based is because Freedom promotes creativity one example of this is when I was in tenth grade my teacher, Genric_Name assigned all of us a element from the table and we were all expecting a full layout and a rubric but we didnt get one. Instead he told us it was completely up to us on how we represented the element and he would want to see some sort of presentation at the end. At first everyone was confused and a bit shocked since this was the first time a project had been completely up to them

As the deadline approached the day of presentations I had done a very creative slideshow and poster of the element Neon which I had glued glow sticks everywhere to get the full effect. As I walked into the classroom I saw all sorts of visuals about elements I had never even imagined it was interesting to see so many people with different projects but there were none alike every one had brought something completely different. Some may disagree with this idea because of too much freedom being bad for a person, but that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that freedom is what lets people make their own mistakes and if they don't have the ability to try something when they think about trying something they will be scared of messing up.

In conclusion giving students the ability to chose and the freedom to make their own choices when it comes to education is better than always having the same structure, the same rubric and the same level of comfort. Getting out of you comfort zone with what gives a person their sense of purpose. A change is needed in a society where people are encouraged to think different why would you limit the future of America and remain making decisions for them, instead of letting them think for themselves when they're young so theyre able to better manage our and your future? Let people think for themselves instead of forcing them to think a certain way and not be able to explore their own paths and ideas.  ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
8F8B11DD9ACC,"BOO! BOO! Cried the Generic_School students when they found out they have to complete a summer project over break in order to assure they do not forget all of the material they have learned over the school year. However, what these students do not know is that they are not the only students that have to complete this project. Various schools have adopted this strategy and there has been a debate about whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Letting students design their summer projects could be an extravagant opportunity because students would have an opportunity to be creative, however, teachers should be in charge of the summer projects because teachers have more knowledge on their subject than the students, more experience with lesson planning, and can also construct projects that can be fun and enjoyable for students.

To start off, summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have more knowledge about their subject than students. For example, by the end of the school year many students have already forgot most of what they have learned over the past school year. On the other hand, teachers teach their subject material over and over again for years at a time. Teachers know their subject like the back of their hands, where as, students are just learning this material and still have much more to learn. Another reason would be that students often have a hard time remembering the material they learned at the beginning of the school year because students have work upon work piled onto them with every class that they take. Once the students learn one unit teachers move onto a different unit and eventually by the end of the year students have so much information crammed into their brains that they can have a hard time keeping up. This is why teachers should take it upon themselves to plan the summer projects for students.

Additionally, teachers have more experience with lesson planning. The job of a teacher is to come up with different lesson plans and strategies for their students to assure they obtain all the information they need. Students are not educated on how to teach other students. Students may be able to come up with a summer project but between the students and the teachers the teachers would have a better project idea because that is their job to have effective projects. Teachers know what strategies work for helping students obtain knowledge. It would be irresponsible to allow students to come up with their own project. Any typical student would not be thrilled about the idea of having a summer project so if students were given the opportunity to construct their own assignment then they would make it to where they would not have to do as much work. However, teachers would guarantee that their project plan would work for their students.

Furthermore, teachers have the ability to construct projects that are fun and enjoyable for students. Although there may be a selective group of teachers who typically would not have hands on and enjoyable projects, majority of teachers could construct a fun summer project for students. Whether the project is to visit a certain historical figure and take notes or to raise awareness for any person in need. Some teachers who are experienced and have worked with students for years at a time are aware of what students are capable of. If a student is motivated enough and has the right resources then they can achieve any project assigned to them. Teachers would also have to keep in mind that every students is different and has different resources and limits.

To conclude, summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers are more knowledgeable than students about their subject, they have effective lesson planning strategies for students, and have the ability to make any project enjoyable for students. There is nothing wrong with assigning students summer projects to make sure that students remember all the material of the past year. Students forgetting material over a set amount of time is not uncommon. As long as these summer projects are fun and not stressful on students then the students will remember their summer for years to come. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
B375FE480591,"Summer is a great time of year for both teachers and students. Months of break and leisure allow for a good cool down after a long school year. However, summer isn't all fun and games, as many schools give out summer assignments in order to keep the students learning over break. But should the responsibility of designing these projects fall on the student or the teacher? I believe that teachers should create and design these projects, as students could make the assignment too easy or too hard, warp the directions to a point where the final product is no longer what the teacher is looking for, or just not complete it.

My first reason justifying my belief is that students could make the assignment too easy or too hard. If given the choice between taking on a difficult assignment and an easy one, most students would choose the easy one. In this same way, if students are given the opportunity to make their own assignment, then they will do everything in their power to make sure it's as simple and easy as possible. This results in them not actually learning anything and defeats the whole purpose of the assignment in the first place. On the other side of the spectrum, there could be students who try to take on too much with their project, setting lofty goals and overcomplicating the assignment. This only serves to build stress the student over break as then they feel as if their project is too much to complete and only do a minimal amount of work on it, if any at all. If a teacher were to give set directions, then this wouldn't happen as there would be a very minimal amount of freedom, resulting in projects being neither too easy or too difficult.

Furthermore, if a student is given the reigns on the creation of an assignment, they could warp the directions, intentionally or accidentally, and the project could end up becoming something the teacher isnt looking for. This could happen for many reasons, ranging from students with malcontent looking to make it easier for themselves or students who just understood the directions differently than the teacher explained them, resulting in a project that doesn't teach the student what they need to learn. If this occurs, the student would not realize their mistake until they go back to school in the fall and turn in their assignment for a grade, leaving them with a bad grade to start off the year and no chance for remediation.

However, the opportunity to create and design the assignment could help students find motivation and may even affect the quality of the work. It's no secret that people do better work when they are invested in the topic or field, and often times go out of their way to avoid topics they hate. Because of this, if students are given the freedom to create their own project, they are more likely to center it around something they are passionate about, leading them to be more likely to not only complete the assignment over break but actually put effort into it.

Contrary to the previous point, students, if left to their own devices, could end up just not doing the assignment. This could happen because the vague guidelines given by the teacher to design an an assignment could be unclear and seem overwhelming to even begin. Non-creative students could also not to start the project as they can't think of a place to start, leaving them to be more likely to not try. Even if the student does get over the initial barrier of creating an assignment, they could get bored wit their topic and change it several times, resulting lack of motivation to actually finish or a final product that is half baked or an amalgamation of several ideas.

In conclusion, summer projects need to be created and designed by teachers in order to prevent students from making and assignment too easy or too hard, warping the directions, or not doing the assignment at all. All of these only result in the students getting nothing out of their summer assignments, leaving precious break time wasted.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
DCABFA6AD5AE,"Summers can be the best times of a students life. They get a break from the stress and anxiety of school and they are allowed to do any and all things they wish to do within the legal limits. Summer projects are designed to keep students engaged and learning. This can be a very good thing as long as the project is based on a topic that the student actually enjoys and will be motivated to complete. Students struggle staying engaged enough during the school year, adding a project during the time they are meant to go be kids should be handled very carefully. If they want the projects to be successful they must set a broad topic and allow the students to chose anything they want under that umbrella topic. Students will enjoy doing a project about a certain YouTube creator they have fun watching, a sports team they love, or even their favorite book they read during school or over summer break. These projects should not be based around a Shakespeare play that they struggle to even read let alone comprehend. Summer projects are a good idea as long as they are handled well.

Assigning a project to a kid during the two and a half month break they get is something that needs to be handled very carefully. Learning is very important and having the project is a good idea. The students must be able to choose exactly what they want to do. This will keep them interested in the project which will make all the grades of the projects go up compared to if it was a topic they have no interest in. The students will use more of their time to perfect the project instead of waiting until the last weekend and just turning it in because they do not care about the topic and do not want to waste their time on something that has no impact on their future as soon as they finish the next test they have on the topic. Allowing the students to pick and choose their topic will help them learn about their team, person, idea, etc. without making them feel the stress and anxiety of a teacher assigned school project.

Projects picked by a student may even result in more knowledge being gained than a teacher assigned project. Students could focus on a sports team and how they network their team to different audiences in different ways. For example, mascots are normally focused on the younger audience. Teams almost always have a promotion for the first certain number of people that arrive. The first one thousand people to go through the security gates get a free t-shirt or the first fifty fans to arrive get a jersey. Marketing and understanding how to focus products to a certain group of people is so important. My dream school, Virginia Tech, has promotions every basketball game that if the opposing team misses two free throws in a row the entire crowd gets a voucher for free bacon. This encourages all Hokie fans to be as loud as possible to mess with the mental mindset of the opposing teams shooter. A majority of jobs and careers that are pursued must have a way of marketing or selling their product so this is a very important skill for kids to have that they would not other wise be able to understand if they had to read a Shakespeare book followed by a five pager paper.

Having a teacher assigned project does have an upside. This will give the students structure and something to base their project on instead of having all the options in the world and not being able to choose one. In school, students are normally more prepared if it is a topic they have been learning about and have background knowledge on compared to a project half way through a topic, or even towards the beginning. If students are given a short book or even a PowerPoint on the topic at hand they will be more successful in completing their project.

A student lead project during the summer is a great thing it keeps the mind or a student engaged with out boring them. Students can research any and all topics they would like so that they enjoy keeping their brain working and focused on bettering themselves. Teacher based projects will give the students structure but will leave them feeling not engaged because the topic is not something they will necessarily enjoy. The idea of a student based project is a good idea and should be created to help the minds and bodies of the students.                               ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
081C66256B98,"Over the summer students tend to forget a vast amount of valuable information they learn during their education. To fix that issue most schools assign summer projects to students every year. These projects assure that students retain the information they learned in school and possibly learn more over the long three month break. In most cases, these projects are teacher-designed and students have no part in the creation of them. Some students may want to design the summer project; however, it should stay as the teachers responsibility. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have more knowledge and teachers know how to creating projects.

To begin, summer projects should be created by teachers because of how much information they know. In order to teach students, it is common knowledge that an educator has to know more than the learners. The summer project is meant to not only help students retain information, but also to learn more, and teachers are easily capable of adding that needed information. If there is a greater amount of information on the project, then students will be able to remember what they have learned. An example of such a project would be The Summer Reading Project because of how much material is sprawled into it. The Summer Reading Project is when students read a book over the summer and are required to fill out a paper with details of the book. This project reminds students of what they learned in English class and also helps students learn more by reading new books. This well thought out project is teacher-designed; therefore, teachers are more capable of creating summer projects than students because they have more knowledge. Either way, teachers having been learning how to teach most of their life should know best on how to create summer projects.

To elaborate, teachers should design summer projects because they know how to create projects better than any student. Teachers learn how to teach and create projects for their students before they can even start educating them. This means that most teachers have experience with creating projects already and that making a summer project would be an easy task. Students have no background in creating projects because they are always the ones who complete them. Therefore, students creating their own projects would most likely end up as a disaster. A scenario like this would be chaos because students rely on teachers to give them the information required to learn, and they can not get that material if they are the ones creating the project. Teachers know how to make projects, so they should be in charge of the construction of summer projects.

On the other hand, some people do believe student-designed summer projects would be more beneficial. This is because it could teach a student how to be responsible or learn on their own. However, many students today are extreme procrastinators and because of that their work would likely be average or below average. Teacher-designed projects are better because there would be a system that students can use to understand information better. If students were in charge it would become a jumbled messy puzzle of a project.

To end, summer projects are better off being created by teachers because teachers are more knowledgeable and know how to create projects better than any student. Teacher-designed summer projects are extremely beneficial for students. New information learned from these projects provided by teachers can help students be prepared for what comes the next year. It is important to have a system in projects and the best people to create that system in the summer projects are teachers.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
BFC824D7C408,"Everytime students hear the word school they all have a similar reaction: ""why school."" This reaction is due to the rigor of work school puts on students' backs and the repetition of constant learning. In order to give students time away, they are given three months of summer break which spans from June - August. During this time many kids choose not to continue learning and a negative effect of this is knowledge and memory decay. In order for their minds to be stimulized and conditioned to learn once school begins, schools are requiring students to complete summer projects. The summer projects should be designed specifically by students because they will be able to acquire knowledge in a way that interests them and express their ideas without being limited by a teacher, on the other hand teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to students because the content created by teachers is consistent with the content learned during the school year.

Summer projects should be designed by students because they will be able to acquire knowledge in a way that interests them. Being able to do something which one is passionate about results in the best work that he/she can produce, this is because learning is driven by motivation. When a teacher assigns something for the student to do, he/she does not have an eagerness to learn because of the fact that it is something they don't have a strong passion for. When students are given an opportunity to produce their own projects, their minds open up and they begin to think outside of the box, which results in true creativity. School is based on a set curriculum and students have no input on what they learn and how they learn it, as a result, students lack effort and motivation to learn. Giving students an opportunity to create will eventually lead to increased productivity in later life One example of this is when adulthood hits and students are required to develop a skill set. Students are never given the opportunity to learn individually and this causes students to become dependent on others to feed them knowledge and information, therefore, students will only learn when they are demanded to. Having the freedom to create will give students their best opportunity to learn, whereas when they are not able to design certain projects, their goal shifts from learning to completing which will result in the content not actually being analyzed and took in.

Not only does students designing their own projects give them a opportunity to pursue their interest, but it also gives them ability to express their ideas in a fashion which they are not pressured and limited by others. Students become boxed in boundaries due to the pressure of doing things a certain way and learning the way teachers tell them to. When students can design projects and learn in a way they believe is beneficial, learning becomes less of pressured task and more of a way to explore one's horizon. One thing students struggle with the most when completing assignments and projects is constant pressure. Students do not have the ability to express their ideas because they have to stick to an exact rubric. One of example of this is a science expo; many teachers tell the students what they should do for the project and don't give the students time to think about what interests them. This pressure of another voice constantly in their head makes learning and expression of ideas a struggle. In order for students to reach their full potential, they should be able to design in a way they are not boxed by others.

In contrast to student-designed projects, teacher designed projects also have a positive impact on students because of their ability to create content which is consistent with the content students learn during the school year. Thinking outside the box and being able to express ideas is very important, however, without teachers, students would have no path of what to learn and how to learn it because they do not have the experience and accumulated knowledge many teachers have. Teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to the students ability to learn during the summer because the content would be structured in way which is taught during the school year. An example of this is when a science teacher assigns a cell packet project which corresponds to the cell unit taught during school. This might be very boring for a student to learn, but doing this project will set the student up for success when school begins. If the student were to design their own project it would probably not be in line with the certain style of teaching which will cause the student to struggle during the school year. The main focus of teachers is to help students succeed in school and by designing these projects students will be able on the correct path to fulfilling that goal.

Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be able to learn in a way which interests them and express their ideas without limitations and pressure by a teacher, on the other hand, teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to students because the content created by teachers is consistent with the content learned during the school year. Being able to acquire knowledge and learn in way which interests one self is very important throughout his/her life, however there are different goals for both the student and a teacher. The teacher's goal is to help the student succeed in a certain class, whereas the students goal is to learn what they want in a way which interests them. Having the right balance is very important and this balance can be obtained by students designing their own projects in the summer and teachers guiding students during the school year. This method will result in individuality development and the teachers can lead the students on the right path throughout the school year. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
138F86B73F7D,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during there break. I think that they should be student-designed because if the schools want the students to do work on there summer break then it should be something they want to learn. Some people might think that they should be designed by teachers to maximize the stuff they can learn. Also If the students design the projects they will have more fun doing them because its something they chose.

I think that if students design there own summer projects they are something they want to do and not what the teachers want them to do. For example if a teacher designs the project then It would be like another day of school and i dont think the students want to do school during there summer break. They would prefer relaxing and not having to do work for 3 months. Also if the students design it then it will be something they like to do. For example having games or something similar to help them learn. Also if its something the students designed and wanted to do It would be more likely to get done and It wouldnt be a waste of time.

Another example why students should assign there own summer projects is that it would be more fun. For example like including math in one of there games. Or having a coloring sheet that helps them with addition or subtraction. Another reason why students should design there own projects is that they would most likely get it done because there having fun with it.

Other people might say that teachers should design the projects because it would maximize the amount of stuff included. For example a student might include easy subjects in there project but teachers could put everything they learned and put it in one project. also if students design it they might get stuff wrong if they dont know it.

In conclusion students should design their own projects because if schools want students to do work on their summer break then t should be something they want to do. Also it should be something fun that they'll want to do and finally some people might say that teachers should design the projects to maximize the amt of stuff included.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
F49906416D5E,"During the summer for most people its the time to go have fun , go out in the sun , go on vacation, work , babysit, or do whatever you want to do .In multiple societies for one-hundred eighty days students attend school and usually most high school students end up working or participating in some kind of sport during this time period . Due to this time line being so hectic with the pressure of studying and commitments within and outside of school its best that students now have this time during the summer to just be kids, be creative , be themselves , learn themselves, and take advantage of this break to the fullest extent. Because some schools require students to complete a summer project the assignment should be student-designed so they can be creative in their own individual ways and reflect growth over time.

Even though teachers are use to giving students direct instructions on their work , it is fundamental to the development of the child to learn individuality. Giving students the choice to express themselves through the work they turn into their teachers at the end of the summer will show you who that person is through their behavior. For example, one day i came into class and my teacher had been telling us for weeks that we were going to have a project to do with no guidlines ... to just be creative and express ourselves into whatever form. She said it doesnt matter what it is it just has to be presentable. I could not figure it out for the life of me what i was going to do, i panicked because it was for my english class my best subject. Then i realized one of the largest issues we deal with as a whole in society today is individuality , who are we. So many people struggle with individuality especially in school systems because everything is mimicked or put in place to follow a direct pathway that is made for students to be like someone else. Which is why that very simple question ""who am i"" ate at me for days until i sat down and really thought about it and i ended up writting a poem . I hadnt realized how much i use to enjoy writting them until i started thinking about something that really stimulated my mind and asked me a question i could contemplate. In the end i got an A in all areas of the summative but the grade didnt matter to me. I learned something that meant something to me that'll carry on into my adulthood. It mattered that one of my favorite english teachers taught me to be creative and unlocked different passions within myself just by giving me an assignment with no guidelines teaching me to teach myself personal growth. Giving students a chance to express themselves in their own ways teach them that its okay to be themselves , its ok to not be perfect , its okay to not know things because your still learning which is one of the best things you can do as a tecaher .

After learning individuality it is important to reflect upon the growth , this will help teachers understand the students as a person overtime. Although if this assignment were teacher-designed the summer poject could just be another way for students to just feel trapped , overwhelmed, or irritated because they feel as if their teacher is giving them pointless busy work during a time their supposed to be having fun. Its better to give them work that means something , work that teachers can study , so they can feel like as a teacher your just as invested in them as they have to be into you. There was a very obvious difference between my english teachers assignments and my science teachers assignments , one of them stimulated my mind with questions about the world that my teacher left up to me to express and talk about and the other left me bored and uninterested and asking for help on bookwork . One of my teachers invested in learning about me for who i am as a person so she could teach me to the best of her capability and the other could care less for who i was as a person. My grades also became a representation of that ; Its understandable that duing the school year theres not alot of time to get to know 100+ students but over the summer dont make students do work for no reason , make it meaningful and make it worth something .

In conclusion because some schools require students to complete a summer project the assignment should be student-designed so they can be creative in their own individual ways and reflect growth over time. School is a large part of the development of all people , it is how you learn and who your taught by for hours at a time . Over the summer these projects give students a way to get rewarded by grades comming back into school by showing who they are as a person. School systems should influence students more by showing that they're invested in them and not just on the grades they make in classes but who they are as a person teaching more than just book smarts but life experiences that they can bring into their adulthood.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
15B6AD38663B,"Students should design the projects that they have to do over summer break not the teachers. If they are designed by the students than they are more likely to make the projects high quality. All school year the teachers create and assign the work so the students should get a chance to create there own work to give the teachers a break. This would be a great oppurtunity for students to learn about something that they are specifically interested in. Students should be the ones designing there summer projects.

When people have an input on what is happening that gives them a bigger sense of excitment for the task. If a person is excited for something than they are going to want to do well on whatever it is. In order to create some excitment for a summer project the students should get to use there creativity to design there very own. There is no reason a teacher would want a student to perform poorly on any assignment. By allowing the students to use there creativity to design there own project is a great way to optimize success on these summer projects.

All school year the teachers are the ones who decide what the assignments will be and how they are going to be done. The students then have to conform to the teachers requests and do the assignments how the teacher expects them to be done. Now the students are going into summer break and have to do more school work. They should get a say in what is being done because they really havent gotten that oppurtunity during the school year. This would also be a great way for teachers to get new ideas for future assignments as well. The students would now get more freedom on what they can do and the teachers can pick up some new ideas for future lessons when school returns. This could really improve teachers lessons and be a great way to grab students attention.

These projects are assigned over summer break to make sure students continue to learn even on a long beak from school. Students would learn more if they got to choose what the project was, based on there interests on specific topics. Even if the topic isnt something thats needed for school students are continuing to sharpen the way they process things when learning which will help them in school. Due to them getting to put there effort into potentaly learning more about something not specifically addressed in school before. This could help some students in the future when deciding what there major will be while attending college.

Allowing students to design there own summer projects will create good oppurtunities for both students and teachers. Students will be more likely to do well on a project they got to design. Teachers would get a break from having to come up with an assignment. This will create a great oppurtinity for students to expand there knowledge on something that they are truly interested in. If there is going to be a summer project having them be student designed is a fantastic idea.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
1469BBBDF3ED,"Summer projects should be design by teachers and not students

Summer of 2016,the teacher assigned a project to read 5 books over the summer break. As a 6th grader the project seemed impossible to accomplish,but, by the end of the summer,the project was completed. 5 books read and a poster summarizing each book. Through out that same year and the following,reading played an important role in my life. Even though sometimes teachers design projects that may be challenging for a student,teachers know what is best for the students;students may not always know what is best for their learning.

A summer project designed by the students has to be chosen before the end of the school year. The problem is that not all students have the same interests,or the materials needed for various projects. Some students might want to do research,not knowing that others may not have access to internet,a computer or the library. When students design their own projects,they are mostly thinking on a way that will benefit them to get the project done and not thinking about what other students will need. This could affect the students that may not get the project finished do to lack of resources.

If a summer project is designed by the students, they might design a project easy enough to finish in the first 2 weeks,so that they can enjoy the rest of the summer. Students might design a project that does not go in depth. they could also design a project that will not necessarily have to do with what was learn over the school year, moreover,students will not challenge themselves to learn when building their own project. A project that does not challenge the students will never help them learn. The purpose of a summer project is so that students learn over the break.

During the school year,teachers design the projects for the students. Teachers know their students,they know what each is capable of and what areas they need to work on. When a teacher designs a project,the project is chosen carefully. The projects designed by teachers will always challenge students to achieve beyond students expectations to reach their best potential. Teachers will never assign a project that is not in the students abilities.

The student's learning is always in the teachers mind when assigning a project.

In conclusion,some schools require students to complete a summer project that should be design by the teacher. When students design projects,the project will not always be in all the students abilities. Teachers design projects so that every student is capable to work on the project and finish it. During summer brake,students do not want to think about school;therefore,the projects designed by the students might not challenge them and help them learn over the break. Teachers know what is best for the students and they should design the summer projects,so that students can learn and grow even when out of the school.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
6269893C45DC,"I think the summer projects should be student designed. If its student designed theres endless amounts of things to do with the projects. Students will have fun with these projects and they'll have fun creating them. Here is why it think it should be student designed.

Students have a wide sense of imagination and giving them an opportunity to do something like this is a great way of showing it. These projects give teachers the chance to see students be creative while still learning how to do things. Students love doing projects it gives them the chance to be interactive and it helps them make new friends. Projects lets students and teachers try something new. Students will have a lot of fun making these projects and so will teachers. Every opportunity Students and teachers get to do a project they have fun, so why not let students try to make their own projects to see if its something that can happen every now and then.

These projects will give teachers the opportunity to see how much the students have learned over the course of the school year. For example, lets say the projects is on the renaissance students get to show what they learned during that portion of the year. Students will make a the work fun and maybe even the teachers will have fun with the projects too. Projects are already a lot of fun but students making their own projects will be a great thing for students and teachers. Teachers and students will get a chance to socialize and learn something new. Teachers won't let students show their creativity.

To summarize, I think that the projects should be student made. It gives a chance for growth and development for the students. Students will have a huge opportunity to show what they've learned during the school year. Seeing students do this really does show how much they've developed the past school year. So therefore it should be student made and not teacher made because some teachers aren't fun.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
150C879555C6,"I think that all people could agree that school is important. Learning is important. It is how humans grow and change through our lives. New things are learned every day, especially while in school. In school, we sit down for about seven hours a day to learn material provided and explained by teachers, for nine out of twelve months of each year. Summer projects, if assigned by a school, should be designed by the student, and not the teacher, in order for students to deepen interests and research topics that may not be provided in a school setting.

While schools continue to grow and change, and add new electives based off of future careers that interest many students, they can not have electives that will interest every student in the school. Electives such as tech ed, cooking courses, and cyber security are offered in my school, which help those students who would like to explore those career areas in the future, can only teach a limited amount of material and provide interests to only a limited number of students. A summer project created and designed by a student would have a completely unlimited amount of subjects that they could explore. Students would be able to create a project based off of something that they are truly interested in, or may already be good at.

By the time most students are getting ready to graduate high school, apply to colleges or pick their major for the the first time, they have no clue what to do because high school didn't provide them with the opportunity to explore many interests. It is a major flaw in the way that the education system works, especially in the United States, because we are taught the important subjects; such as math, which can be applied in many careers, science which is required for all medical careers and many more, history which is important to know, so that it doesn't repeat itself, and english, which once you get up to a certain point, only applies to a very limited number of professions. It would not help students to do yet another project based off of a subject they have years to sit in a classroom and learn about. Students should be able to explore what interests them, outside of those mandated subjects. A summer project where a student has freedom to learn what they desire to learn about could look like, a girl who wants to explore architecture and builds a small structure, or a boy who wants to be firefighter and decides to volunteer at his local fire station, which he might not have time for during the school year. It could also be a way for a student that has no clue in the world what they want to do, to learn about a carer so different from anything they have learned in school.

Summer is designed to be a break for students, I believe that most students would find it much less frustrating and more willing to do their best with a project, if they could do anything with it they wanted to. A project designed by the student would require much more imagination than a project with a rubric and instructions already provided by a teacher. Students would create something with passion and they would have desire more desire to learn if they could choose what it would be about.

Some may argue that a project with stricter learning guidelines and design guidelines created by a teacher would be more benefit that a project created by the student, but it is evident that students learn the way teachers would like us to learn for our entire school year. We learn our lessons the from the teacher and we take the tests created by the teacher who wrote our lessons. A project based off of a student's imagination would be very different from what a typical project designed by a teacher would look like, but it would be very different in the best way.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
57BB48970618,"Every student has expierienced that one teacher who tries to give homework over break. Most Students look forward to summer break due to the fact that they have waited all year to be let out of school and have fun. With those statements put out there some schools require students to complete projects over the summer. They want students to continue learning over the summer. Schools should allow students to decide what projects they have to do over the summer. Reasons for this include students have to complete these assignments so they should design them, these assignments should be something they enjoy, they know what they need practice on. Therefore, this paper will elaborate on why this is the correct way to go.

Students should be able to pick their assignments because they are the ones that are going to have to complete it. Yes, the teachers may assist the students in the proccess, but the student will be the one to complete the project ,and is expected for them to learn from it. Summer time for every student is supposed to be fun instead of being filled with work and stress. Yes, it is good for students to learn but, a break is for the student to relax because they have spent their entire school year working hard. A student should not have to spend their summer break doing school work because schools want them to learn more when school is done for the year. some might argue that only the teachers know what is best for the student becuase they teach them. However, if teachers were to decide what the students should complete the students may not try complete the assignments. Therefore, this may cause the students to not learn anything at all, and they will slowly become unmotivated.

Another important thing to remember is the students should be able to do something they enjoy. It should not feel like school all over again, these projects should allow them feel like they are still on a summer break. Meaning students should not be overloaded with work and they should be given enough time to complete it. keeping in mind that they may have other summer plans. Especially not to where the student feels like giving up and feel to tired to continue on with their learning goals. Some educators will bring up the fact that everything that is good is not always fun but, they should want students to enjoy the things they do. This will allow students to still be able to enjoy their vacation, and be able to relax. Students should not feel like they are being forced to learn therefore, teachers of all grade levels would agree that students learn better when they are having fun. These assignments can be made fun by making the projects group related, or the students being able to win cool prizes.

Lastly, the students know what they need help on the most, every individual student has diffrent learning abilities. Ever student has subjects that they struggle with and subjects that they are successful in. Therefore, the students should each be able to pick their own individual projects that will help them in the long run. If schools are suggesting that students still learn even after the year is over then, it is best that the teachers assist the students in what they pick but, they should let the students decide on their own. However many individuals would disagree and say the teacher knows best becauase she teaches the students but, this doesnt mean much because only that individual knows what they truly stuggle with and want to learn. Students should be able to choose whatever subject they desire as long as they can learn something from it. The schools should want their students to strive and be successful in every way possible even if that means they have to take their own path.

Overall, students should be able to take their own route when it comes to knowing whats best for them. Students should be considered more when it comes to learning. Students should be able to make their learning expierience fun, students know what they need help with, and students are the ones that have to complete these assignments. No student is the same, every individual has diffrent needs and some schools fail to understand that. There are always lots of ways to tackle issues when it comes to learning. It can be a good expierience for everyone if every individual is taken into consideration. The main goal is for every student to learn something over the summer, this can be achieved as long as students remain as the main priority.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
0F92CE19A137,"Though I do not like summer projects, as I feel summer is a time to relax, if we are going to be assigned summer projects, they should be designed by students, not teachers. Most teachers do not understand us kids just want to have fun during the summer and not have to worry about some project worth 20% of our first nine weeks grade. It causes uneccesary stress during what should be a stress-free break and a student-designed project would reduce that stress.

Something designed by a student is most likely going to be fun, like taking some pictures or making a little movie, not reading a boring book no one has heard of and then answering questions about it. No one wants to do anything like that during their breaks. A fun project is also more likely to be done. It is common sense that people are more willing to do something if it is entertaing and not tedious. Especially students.

Furthermore, it is going to be many desgrees less stressful. If something is designed by a student, it will be made in a way that is not stressful at all. Most students do not want that added weight and responsibilty during summer break. As I stated before, many of us have jobs, and we do not need that extra stress.

However, a teachers project would actually be educational and will most likely be designed to keep you on your toes. We tend to forget things we learned last year over the summer, so it is a good thing teachers give us work; even if we do not want it. But it is called break for a reason. But if we get work, might as well be fun.

So in conclusion, these summer projects should be student-designed. It is less stressful, more enjoyable, and it would take much less time from our break. Though teacher-designed would be more enriching, we can worry about learning subjects and remembering them during school, and not our break.                                                                                                                                           ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
0BCBCD2D4FEA,"To test students on their knowledge, teachers have begun to assign projects rather than traditional tests. There has been a debate on if these projects should be designed by teachers or by students. I believe these summer projects need to be teacher- designed. The teachers have much more experience at designing projects, the students may assign themselves an easier project, and the teachers get payed tax revenue for the sole purpose of teaching children and designing projects.

The first major reason these projects should be teacher- designed is that teachers have experience in creating projects. Most teachers have gone through many years of education to get where they are today. They have gained skills and insight that most students do not have. Because teachers have this experience and knowledge, they know how they can force their students to display what they know. A project is meant to be a creative display of the collective information students have learned. Because students have not been prepared in education, they do not have the skills to properly design a project for other students. Some people may argue that when teachers let students design their own projects, they are teaching them important skills such as problem solving. Although their problem solving skills may be tested, they are still more likely to design a less efficient project due to their lack of education preparation.

Where as a student lacks this education preparation, a teacher has spent years gathering it. Teachers can use their knowledge to create the perfect project for the class.

Another reason projects should be designed by teachers is that the students may try to design an easier project so they can complete it quicker. As a student myself, I know that many students will try to get out of work if they can. Every school has issues with students not completing their assignments. When given the power to chose their work load, students most often pick an easier assignment. When most teachers assign a project, they do not want it to be a quick and easy task for the students. A project is meant to challenge the student. Students typically try to avoid such challenges. Students, like all humans on earth, are flawed. From my own high school experience, I know that I would design my project to give me the best chance of receiving an excellent grade. If students are forced to design projects, projects will become less efficient in displaying what a student understands. Teachers are more willing to challenge the students and help them grow.

The final reason that teachers should design projects is that they are payed to do so. A significant portion of American tax revenue is used to pay teachers who work across the country. When teachers force students to design projects, the teacher is pawning off his or her own work to the students. Many tax- paying citizens would be incredibly upset to see their taxes go to waste. If teachers are allowed to pawn off their work and still get payed, it sets a very poor example for the young, impressionable students. It teaches the students that you can make others do your work just so you can receive the credit. It would be unethical for any teacher to force their own student into fulfilling the job and tasks of a teacher.

In conclusion, all school projects should be designed by the teacher because it would be morally irresponsible if they did not. Projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have more education preparation than students, the students tend to avoid hard work, and teachers are payed to design projects and classwork. If we allow students to design projects, the American education system would be doing a great disservice to the young students of today, and the the leaders of tomorrow.     ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
AFCE5307F69A,"The time off of school during summer break is always looked forward to by students and teachers, but it doesn't mean the school work stops. Summer projects are a way to ensure that students can continue to learn information over the break, but many students would not want to complete them. Although teacher-designed projects would be beneficial for learning in more detail, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows for the students to be more creative, have more freedom, and be more engaged in their project. Student-designed projects allow for students to feel like the project is less of a requirement, and rather more of an enjoyable activity.

Creativity is exactly what students need in order to complete projects in a more effective way. When students design their own project, they let their minds flow freely. This allows for the creation of projects that the students actually are interested in, which helps them become more engaged about whatever the project was about. It is a common belief that teachers should design projects so they can get their students to learn exactly what they need to, and that a student-designed project is not sufficient enough because students will not learn what they need to. However, a project by students allows them to learn content even better because they are choosing what they want to create, not being assigned it, and this creation allows them to explore content in a way that a teacher can't provide. For example, if a student had to create an instrument for music class from scratch, they would be a lot more interested in that than just making a variation of a particular instrument again. The creativity in designing a project is what students need to learn content in a way that is interesting to them, which helps them learn better during a time period where they don't even want to be doing work.

When a student designs their own project, there are very few restrictions applied. This is good because the students can learn required content however they want to, and they will most often choose to learn it in a way that is effective for them, which a teacher can't always provide. There is the argument that teachers can just give students a variety of options to choose from with a project, and that that freedom in choice will help students learn in a way beneficial to them but unfortunately that just isn't the case. Many students never get to create a project that they actually want to make, and teachers often just repeat options over and over again that students are already familiar with. For example, what if a teacher just kept giving out the same current events question, and a student never got to answer the question they were actually interested in? The freedom in designing a project allows a student to actually want to learn content, since they choose a way to learn content that would be fun to them. A student-designed project over summer would allow students to freely choose how they want to learn, which is exactly what is needed since many students do not feel motivated to work on school over summer.

Many students who complete projects throughout their school careers are not engaged in their work, and are just focused on getting a project done by the deadline with all the requirements. A student-designed project would allow students to feel more engaged in their work and not just worry about when it's due, but rather what they are learning throughout the process. Many people think that teachers can fix this problem by allowing students to choose what is required in the project, for example requiring students to pick 15 vocabulary words out of 30 to include in a newspaper project. This just isn't the same as letting a student pick out what they design though, as students would actually feel motivated to create a good project since it is something they want to complete. Students would feel more engaged in their project and feel like it was less forced if they had the ability to design it themselves.

Required summer projects by some schools would be most beneficial if they were student-designed, because it would allow for students to be more creative, feel more freedom, and be more engaged in the overall process of learning through a project. This is especially important for summer projects because many students in the summer do not want to do any school work, so a teacher assigning a student another forced project would not motivate them to complete it, while if the student got to design it themselves, they would be more interested and likely create a better project while learning more. Teachers do have the ability to design a project that students would enjoy, but the student-designed project truly allows for more learning by the students because it is more entertaining and an overall better experience.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
2CFC7FE26251,"I think the summer projects should be student-designed, why ? during the summer students would not like to think about any school work. It's good to go over and have work from school during your break so when you come back you can earn new material without forgetting. However a teacher-designed could work also, students don't want to feel like we're still in school during our whole break. Our break is to have fun and go out and enjoy the weather and ourselves. Now we are going to go in detail and talk about both opinions of the argument.

For the teacher-designed many students will agree to that. Teachers will have to come back the last month to get their classroom situated, and they plan throughout the summer and go to training. Some teachers might be changed to a different subject to teach. Instead of giving work packets, teachers can email work to do online and the students might do it. And some teachers will be seeing students during break because of summer school, for the teachers whose teaching there they can ask for their work while sitting with them.

The student-designed, some might agree and disagree. Some students feel as if their summer break purpose is to take a break from school work. Some kids don't have a problem with remembering what they learned the last school year. Others naturally study and go over anything they struggled with. And the students who don't mind won't have a problem with doing projects over their break.

The disagreeing part, many students feel as if they worked hard and deserve a break. Some students be busy while out of school, some work and attend camps. For ones who do other stuff might not have enough time to get the projects done on time. Many just not do it because there is no school. Being that it's not no school they might think it's not counted against them.

My opinion on it, is that I think that the summer projects should be teacher-designed, it'll loosen a lot of other things that needs to be done in the summer time during break.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
7117C54BA9D6,"Some schools require students to complete summer assignments to make sure that they continue learning over the long summer break. There has been some debate on whether or not these assignments should be designed by students, or designed by teachers. Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because; teachers can create assignments specifically tailored to their class, teachers can use summer assignments to help students with subjects that have been historically struggled with, and most of the students are not familiar enough with the material to create an assignment by themselves.

The first reason reason why teachers should design their own summer assignment is that the teacher can create an assignment that is specifically tailored for their class. A teacher knows both what material the students will be learning and how they will go about learning it. A teacher could use this knowledge to create an assignment that creates prior learning in an area that they will not cover as much. This will make sure that the students have a greater understanding of a topic without needing to take valuable class time to learn it. An example of an assignment like this would be a required reading. Students would be required to read a book about a topic selected by the teacher and complete an assignment to demonstrate understanding of the text. The teacher's contact information would be made available to the students so that any important questions could be answered. With an assignment like this, the students are functionally teaching themselves over the summer. A teacher could also use this assignment to create interest in the class. A teacher could compile all of the topics that students typically find interesting into a sort of class preview that will make students more curious about the class. This curiosity could create a better work environment and allow students to learn even more over the year.

The second reason why teachers should design their own summer assignments is because they can use summer assignments to help students with subjects that have been historically struggled with. Teachers are aware of which subjects students generally struggle with, and can use that information to help future students. Teachers can use the summer assignment for this by creating prior knowledge about the more difficult subjects. If the students are already somewhat familiar with the material, it will take less class time to teach it. This leaves more time to answer individual questions and help students understand the specific parts that the class is struggling with. An example of how a teacher could do this is by assigning a research paper. If the students are free to do their own research, they will develop an interest in the topic over the course of the writing. The students will be essentially teaching an entire difficult subject to themselves. The students could then present their essay to the class to show their individual findings. The class will teach each other about their own findings until every individual is competent in the subject. The teacher's contact information should be made available so that any questions that come up can be answered, but the students should rely mostly on other credible sources for their information.

The final reason why teachers should create their own summer assignments is because students are not familiar enough with the material to create assignments for themselves. All the information that students usually have about a class before they take it is the title of the class, and a brief description of the material. The students know almost nothing going into a class while teachers have experience teaching the subject and know how to best introduce it to students. There can be no argument for students creating their own assignments because they are simply not knowledgeable enough to design a focused and useful assignment. If students were to create their own assignments, there would be several problems. One main issue is that the students' projects would not be focused on the acutal course, but on what they thought the couse was loosly about. Students do not know much going into a class and can not possibly know enough about the class to create a well designed assignment that will effectively introduce them to the material. Another issue is that students will try to make it easier on themselves. Students do not always have the best work ethics ,especially over the summer. If given the choice, they will always choose an easier rout even if it means sacrificing a part of their education. If students are allowed to create their own assignments, they will most likely create something that is not challenging at all and therefor not useful. If a summer assignment is not neither challenging nor introducing new material, it is functionally useless. The final issue is the fact that teachers will have no way to accurately grade an entirely student created project. The teacher has no way of judging quality if the details of the assignment are unclear. If each individual comes in with a different assignment, the teacher will have no choice but to hand out arbitrary grades based on nothing at all. A project without a rubric is impossible to grade.

There aresome schools that require students to complete assignments over their summer break. The objective of these assignments is to ensure that the students continue to learn over the long summer break. There has been debate about whether or not these summer assignments should be designed by teachers or by students. The summer assignments should be designed by teachers for a multitude of reasons including; teachers can create assignments specifically tailored to their class, teachers can use summer assignments to help students with subjects that have been historically struggled with, and most of the students are not familiar enough with the material to create an assignment by themselves.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
21EFAE02832D,"I believe students should design summer projects instead of teachers, what do you think? i believe so and here is why. Most students think more alike other students because most of them have the same knowledge than others but. That doesn't mean that the whole school will have students that could think like teachers. By all means this proves that there is a lower chance those students with high developed knowledge will be the ones doing the summer projects for others to complete. The students that do create some of the summer projects will make sure not to make them to hard or to easy that way the students doing them can surly keep learning during break without stressing about it. The students that make the summer project will also make them easier for there fellow classmates. Some of the students that are doing the summer project could be stressing about it but that also means they won't make it to difficult because they would want to get over with it already and focus on something else to get there minds distracting. So that we they cannot be thinking so much about school. As well as the students doing them won't stress as much about them because they'll know it's not to difficult and can do it any time during the summer, such being the last week or the last day so they can have all summer to them selves. Not having to think about school. When students aren't thinking about school that doesn't mean they're not learning it, just means they're trying to get there head off of something that highly stresses them about a lot of work or having to deal with for a long time and that's the only time they can get a break from it and not stress about school. The reason being of students doing them than instead of teachers they also won't have to do a lot of writing or work for starters. Students will be sure to not make them as long because they know what it feels like to get assigned a long and stressful assignment especially over the summer break that is the only time you actually get a break from school. Students also doing the assignments will help out teachers to also get a break and focus on other important related stuff they have as well. The students creating the summer projects can also be more open minded after doing them and grow they're knowledge as well as learning better and thinking of ideas more often for school. Teachers can review the students work and see how fine they do. The students who do well creating can continue to do so if they feel goo about themselves doing it for the other students that weren't so bright at it can give out ideas and help out the students doing them. I believe other schools and principals will be impressed by having a school with students creating they're summer projects and that is wonderful. I believe that having students create the summer projects is an outstanding idea for the community and school they will think of them differently and have a better picture of themselves. This argument has been good because it will open the eyes of many students and have them be brave enough to put themselves up for the challenge. If you believe students should create these summer projects instead of teachers write your own prompts to see what you guys have in mind. I think my argument is well stated and many teachers will surly think about letting it happen. Don't you believe so as well? Yes indeed you do.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
86CAA05C9969,"Although the primary purpose of summer break is to allow students to relax and not worry about rigorous courses, some schools require that students complete summer projects so they can maintain the academic mindset they had during the school year in preparation for the upcoming year. While these projects ensure that students keep their brains working during the break, the types of projects that are assigned to them is an important factor towards whether the students are benefiting or being hindered by them. These ""types"" of projects could either be teacher-designed or student-designed, each providing their own benefits and drawbacks. Putting these two against one another, the teacher-designed projects provide students with greater advantages than the student-designed projects, and the disadvantages of the former are not as critical as the latter.

Teacher-designed projects are preferable over student-designed projects because of the prior experience teachers might have with completing summer projects when they were in school. They will already have an idea on the kind of projects that will benefit students the most based on the projects they believe helped them the most when they were students. For example, if a teacher completed a summer project for a specific subject, they immensely enjoyed doing it, and they performed better in the subject in the following school year because of it, they would design a project similar to the one that improved their performance because it has been proven that that kind of project allows students to develop and improve their skills so they can be more than prepared for the next school year. The same applies with the contrary situation: if teachers had to complete a summer project that they thought was boring, uninteresting, or just did not get their brains working, then they would take note that that is not the kind of project they should be assigning their students since they would likely develop the same opinions about it. In short, teachers having past experience regarding summer projects is crucial in order to provide students with the most desirable projects that can best maintain their academic mindsets over the break.

With the amount of years teachers have spent learning and building up their teaching education in school and college, they will have more credibility than most when it comes to proposing ideas, in this case summer project designs, to the school board. The main purpose of the school board is to give students the best school environment and experience, but that does not simply apply to only during the academic school year; they want to find ways to guarantee that students continue to successfully learn all year round so their education level continues to grow all the way until they graduate. The board has the largest say when it comes to approving ideas related to the schools in their designated area, so teachers could go to them and request for their approval on their project idea. The school board would trust that the teacher thoughtfully designed a logical project, so they might request that specific testing be performed to see how good of an idea it is before accepting it. If it is accepted after testing, then that provides the teacher with extra verification that their project idea will benefit the students during their break from school. If anyone else (aside from other members of the school board,) proposed an idea for summer project, it would likely be more difficult for the board to consider their idea because they would have less credibility regarding their teaching experience, and the board would not want to risk wasting their time on some unproven person's idea. Therefore, teacher-designed projects are the ones that greatly benefit from the approval of the school board to ensure that student will maintain their skills in the best way possible.

However, with all these advantages that teacher-designed projects have, some people believe that student-designed projects have more benefits, and that is understandable. Possibly the most important reason why some believe that student-designed projects are better is that these students creating the projects are designing them based off of their peers. Being their peers, these students are more aware and can better comprehend the kind of mindsets that they have than teachers and adults in general. This is because the way generations are taught changes immensely, and it has been proven that teaching methods have greatly altered over the past few decades. For example, with the drastically increasing presence of technology, many teachers today are using technology as a huge part of their teaching, which is a great difference compared to a mere decade ago when technology was barely utilized in the classroom. However, being students, they run into a similar problem that adults who are not teachers have when proposing ideas to the school board: they do not have the credibility. Some students might believe they understand their peers better than the teachers understand them, but they are still students whom do not have the proper education to design projects for other students. The fact that mere students could immensely impact the way their peers perform in school is baffling because it should be the teachers' job to design projects for the future generation of adults, not the students whom have so much more to learn like their peers. It is the teachers that proven they are capable of creating things that can change and benefit the way that young students learn and maintain their skills.

It should always be up to the teachers to design summer projects for students. They better understand the curriculum based on experience, and they have the extra approval of the school board when they propose their ideas. The students that still want to design projects for other students will eventually get the opportunity to do so; that is what attending college to further build up their education is for.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
53A15ABA8872,"Since the increase in school attendance, homework, a form of continual, at-home learning, was created to eliminate forgotten knowledge and stimulate academic development outside of the classroom. Due to this, new forms of such medium have developed transpiring into what is now know as summer assignments. Although, there is still much debate centered around if such projects should be student or teacher designed. Although, a student designed summer assignment may be beneficiary to the student in terms of difficulty and creativity, in order to better actively promote proper continual education and prepare children for their upcoming course load, all summer projects should be based off of a teacher's model.

As humans are confronted with adversity, many choose the path of least difficulty. This trend of human nature can be seen dating back to the first man. Through evolution man was taught always to take the ladder of the two in order to insure survival; the modern interpretation of this instinctual thought would be classified as laziness. The average student, just like Chromagnum Man, will typically not go the extra mile if given the easier path; therefore, in order ensure proper brain stimulus and appropriate student effort, a teacher-designed summer assignment is necessary.

In prepare students for the upcoming challenges and expectations regarding their course selection, students must be allowed to model expectations from a given, teacher-assigned, summer assignment. Children are taught on the principles of mimicking behavior. Therefore, by modeling expectations, students are allowed to prepare for their future courses through a natural monkey-see, monkey-do pattern. In order ensure proper learning, a appropriate model for a learning basis should be given to students to better prepare for the year to come.

Additionally, in order to better prepare for students' future academic course loads, teachers, as fellow advocates for education, should be inclined to facilitate proper thought processes in academics by the means of a carefully designed project. Examples of proper learning environments are already seen through the public schooling system, so inherently this should be expected at a must in order to stimulate the brain at home just as it has throughout the school year previously and to come. through this thought process is has become imperative that the modern child needs not only a active learning goal, but also a way in which to achieve it; that way comes in the form of a teacher-designed summer assignment.

As previously touched on, the thought of allowing for a creative, student-designed project is one that naturally comes to the mind of many students as well as teachers; though this thought process inevitably roots from laziness. As discussed prior, the student will always take the ladder of the route eventually reverting to a lazy state if improper precautions are taken; in actuality, facilitating such behavior.

Throughout this process of argument, it has become indicative that the matter in which thought is stimulated and perceived in consequential to the manner in which it is given. If given the option, most students will take the road most traveled as a natural reaction to adversity. Additionally, students must be prepared for proper course load through a guided thought process. In order to achieve a proper though process, a appropriate learning environment must be achieved at home through use of teacher modeling (a teacher-designed summer assignment). The allowance of free rain over projects under the fallacy of creativity spurs laziness over both student and educator as evident to human biology through evolution. With the facilitation of such student needs, the brain is allowed to prosper and continually develop intellectually to create yet another productive member of society.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
46DC70997CEB,"Some schools are given summer project to assure students continue learning throughout the summer. Since, the summer project is completed over the summer I believe it should be student-designed. First reason being is cause students should be able to make the project as they please as this embraces their imagination as to how they would like it to be and not just lock up any possible ideas they might have. Another being, it'll let the student complete the project to the best of their ability. Lastly, teacher-designed projects can get a bit stressful and overwhelming. Summer projects can benefit the students more if they're student-designed.

Student-designed projects allow the student to create the project freely with no restraints. For example, several weeks ago my forensics teacher gave her classes a project based on serial killers. The project was all up to the student except for the fact that it had to be a cereal box. It was fairly easy, we just had to pick a serial killer that we were interested in and also write fun and interesting facts about said serial killer. Very little were bad or plain, meanwhile, others were fun and entertaining with games, crosswords, toys, and other activities! I believe since we were able to do it on our own it enabled the class to receive higher scores on the project; therefore, we should be given student-designed projects.

Teacher-designed projects can get a bit excessive at times with a lot of work which eventually lead to stressful and overwhelming situations. For example, before this school year started several friends of mine were gonna take AP US History, which they had received a summer project for the class. Their was summer was okay until about a week before school started. That's when they realized they should've started weeks ago as the project was a packet with several pages of questions. Frantically and desperately they began their summer assignment, and well they may have lost some sleep due to staying up late but they ended up finishing. Although, my best friend had it the worse since she began her day with morning conditioning, followed by her going to work, and lastly afternoon practice and the stress from the summer project did't help. AP teacher-designed projects are lengthy and extra, which is why one should prefer student-designed projects.

In conclusion student-designed projects allow a student to be free with their own creativity and knowledge which allows them to work to the best of their ability. Also they don't produce as much stress as the teacher-designed projects. Lastly from other people one learns some teacher-designed projects can induce more stress into ones life which leads to other negative effects. Which is why teachers should make student-designed projects to let their students creativity roam free. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
5D2FA6B9D165,"Once school is over, students finally can enjoy their long summer break after months of hard work. Despite this, many teachers require summer projects that can turn an exciting summer into one full of stress, procrastination, and boredom. Personally, I have experienced several teacher-designed summer projects that have been a hardship to complete and require me to do unnecessary amount of tedious work. I have always wished that there was some sort of alternative that could be educational and still allow me to enjoy it, such as student-designed projects. Summer projects should be student-designed instead of teacher-designed because the students will be more likely to complete it successfully and teacher-designed projects are far more restricting and dull.

Students are more likely to complete their project successfully if they design it themselves. In the past, I have experienced many summers in which I was assigned a specific teacher-designed project, and the majority of the students in my class did not have any motivation to do it. Often times, it leads to several students procrastinating and trying to finish the entire project days before the end of their break, or not doing it at all. However, during the school year we were given different types of projects that allow us to design them ourselves, I noticed that even students who procrastinate or don't complete their summer projects have a much more successful project when they design them. For example, during the school science fair, when the students were given the opportunity to do a project on their own, they were much more motivated to complete it and finished quicker. This resulted in many of them receiving 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place awards which clearly shows how much more successful they can be. Also, when students have the opportunity to design projects themselves, it is much more engaging because they are able to execute the project in the way they please. Once they are more focused and committed to what they like, they create more advanced and successful projects that can enhance their learning, as opposed to forcing students to doing something they have no interest to do in the first place. Allowing student-designed summer projects can help them complete their project successfully due to them being more motivated to do it and being able to choose what they want.

Teacher designed projects can be very restricting and dull, which can make students have a more difficult learning process. Since teachers and students have completely different perspectives, when teachers design projects they tend to forget to consider how the student may react to it. Teachers may pick projects that are not interesting for the student and don't catch the attention of them, which makes it much harder for the student to start the project or learn anything. Many teachers I have had in the past have assigned very restricting projects that leave no room for creativity or choice, which makes it nearly impossible for students to be interested in it. Once the student is not interested, their learning process has been completely hindered by their teachers since the students have no input or ability to be creative. Furthermore, when students are assigned a project they do not want to do in the first place, it makes it much harder for them to have the drive to even start the project, which prevents them from learning anything at all. It is much harder for students to learn, or anyone in general, when they have no interest in something or do not want to complete it. When teachers design projects themselves they don't give the students the ability to be creative, which leads to restricting and boring projects that prevent students from being able to adequately learn.

A valid argument that may be proposed by people in favor of teacher-designed summer projects is that student-designed projects won't continue to develop the learning that the teachers require. However, their is a simple way to ensure that the students are still learning while making student-designed projects; the teachers could make a basic rubric or requirement that may ask for a few topics or ideas to be covered while still allowing the students to design the projects on their own. For example, a Spanish language class could assign a student-designed summer project for students to demonstrate their Spanish speaking skills in any that they please, but may require the students to use 10 conjugated verbs. Doing so allows for a student to still be creative and design the project themselves and guarantee that the learning aspect is incorporated into their project. Also, by giving students freedom to design the project how they please, this allows them to do more research and exploring on their own, which can branch out their learning not only into the required curriculum, but also learn other valid information in the long run. When the students choose how they design their project, they will have be able to be more independent and this can teach the students various more topics and they can do tasks on their own without the teachers pressuring them. Allowing student-designed projects can still allow them to continue their learning in the summer because the students can have the ability to explore and research themselves, and teachers can still install a basic requirement that ensures their learning process but still gives the student freedom.

Summer projects should be student-designed because the students will be more likely to complete it successfully and teacher-designed projects are far more restricting and dull. Student-designed projects can open up a student's imagination and creativity, and also allow them to be independent and learn on their own. They will enjoy the project more and be stay motivated, allowing them to create a more successful project that can deepen their learning. In the end, they will have a great final project and still be able to have a great summer.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
6776B92E4513,"During summer break, many students are busy on vacation or are preoccupied with other activities. Because of this, students are not reinforcing what they have previously learned or preparing for the upcoming school year. Summer projects are an efficient way to get students familiar with and exposed to concepts they will learn in school and bolster their knowledge. However, the decision of making summer projects either teacher-designed or student-designed creates a debate of the effectiveness of both types of projects. Summer projects should be teacher-designed as teachers are more knowledgeable with the curriculum which will allow them to prepare an assignment that is more effective for the student, teacher-assigned projects will provide a guide for what the students will or should learn, and students will most likely feel more prepared for school with an assignment created by the teacher.

Since teachers know more about the subject they teach more than the students, having teachers create their own assignment for their students will be more effective. They know what the students need to learn based on the curriculum, so it is ideal for them to decide what they should study over the break. Students will get more out of the assignment if the teacher prepares an assignment that relates directly to what they will learn in class when school begins. It will also strengthen their knowledge and possibly reinforce what they had learned before.

Teacher-designed projects will be a guide for students during their summer break to study useful information for their classes. Teachers can design projects that is relevant to the curriculum of the class and plan out what is necessary and useful to know versus what is not. In addition, teachers usually expose basic ideas and important concepts that will help students to make connections to what they learned through the summer assignment. These teacher-designed also provides some insight for the student on what to expect in the courses that they take.

Having teachers make their own summer projects will expose the material that students need to know when they go back to school. It will help students to feel more comfortable coming to class and ready to begin learning. Through these projects, students have studied and have a better understanding of the curriculum of the class as the teacher directed the students on content they need to know. These projects also help students to gradually feel familiar with concepts they learn in the beginning of the school year rather than jumping straight ahead to learning something new.

Not only do teacher-designed projects enforce learning and help students to get more comfortable with the content of the class, but they also prepare students before the upcoming school year begins. It is ideal for teachers to design such projects as they know most about the curriculum of the class, and it allows them to prepare a useful tool for students to study to get familiar with concepts and important ideas of the class. These projects are a small exposure of what students are expected or need to know and will help them to be more successful when they begin learning in their classes.        ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
A165EEC2E930,"Teachers should be the ones to design our summer projects for many different reasons. They know what is needed for us to know by the time the next school year comes around, most of the time they have a better understanding of what we need to learn , and if kids were to design the summer projects they will most likely forget many factors or make it too easy and not put as much effort into it. These summer projects help and make sure kids are still learning and not forgetting everything that they have been taught throughout the school year.

Teachers should gather together and create the summer projects based off what they know that we will need to know for the upcoming years. This can be really helpful because most kids think that some things we learn will not be useful or won't do us any good but the only ones who really know what will be needed for the years to come, are the teachers. This can be such an advantage for the students and teachers. Instead of the teachers spending so much time in the beginning of the year going back over what we learned the year before they can just get right into the lesson because what needed to be reviewed has already been refreshed in our memories over the summer because of the project. By teachers creating the summer project, it can help make class time more valuable and it can help spend less time on reviewing things from previous years.

If the students were to design the summer project way more things would come into effect, like how the project will be graded, what is on there vs. what should've been on there, and everything important we left off. As students we dont know what we need to learn that is clearly why we are being taught. Teachers have the best way of helping us understand what we need to learn and most of the time they know what is best for our learning. That is why we have teachers, so we can be taught what we need to know. Students all have different ways of learning, and yes not every teacher is can cater to every student and teach them the way they needed to be taught but at the end of the day the teachers are the ones who help us the most with our education and teach us the important things we need to know. Not every student can just come up with a summer project already knowing everything that should be incorporated into it. Teachers have a much better understanding of what needs to be taught and what we need to go over so we can understand it better and know our material.

A big part in learning for many students is being challenged. Do you really think if a student designed the summer project that it will be challenging ? or will it be so easy that it doesn't really help the student grasp the concept of the material ? Many students find ways to do just the bare minimum to get them by, or they find ways to get the project done without really knowing what they are even being taught or to get it done without knowing what they are really doing. Many teachers find or have many different ways to help students understand what is being taught and also make sure that student is actually trying and getting by so easy. Most students will do what they have to do to get them by and that isnt really helping us learn.

In conclusion it is in the best interests of most students if the teachers make the summer projects because they have a much better understanding of what can help us and what we need to know for the upcoming school year. In most classes the teachers spend the beginning of the school year going over material from the previous year, if the teacher makes the summer the project they can easily see what we do need to go over and what we dont and it can save us so much time in the classroom to learn new things instead of going over what we already know and have been taught. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
0BF9F64D6FD1,"Students across all age groups look forward to the last day of school, the day summer vacation begins. From the endless memories summer entails, to the exciting, fun experiences, summer vacation is one of the most beneficial times for students. For many high school students, teachers assign summer assignments or projects that relate to a class they may be taking in the upcoming school year. These assignments tend to require an expansive amount of time and also tend to be rather ineffective. In the summer students want to fill their time with exciting activities that they would enjoy. We live in the age of self exploration with some the most inquisitive students, but we still conform to the age old summer assignment system. In a new modern classroom setting, students should have the liberty to design their own summer projects because students are more inclined to learn when they have the liberty to decide their work, and the process of self exploration is the key to molding successful minds.

When given a task you do not enjoy, most people do either of two things. The first thing they do is rush the task to get it over with, and the second thing they do is push it off as much as they can. Similarly, when a student is given an assignment that is not of interest to them, the quality of work is very low. In reference to the summer, this general idea is heightened; a majority of students tend to push off assignments to the very latest, creating lackluster work and also not learning much from the assignment. Personally, I have experienced this repeatedly. When I was given a summer assignment for my English class this year, I was eager to read the book. While, the book was interesting the assignment was extremely long. The intended goal of the assignment was to expand the knowledge and analysis of the book, but after completing the assignment, I felt like that once held excitement and knowledge was gone. If I had the ability to design my own assignment relating to the book, I most likely would have enjoyed completing the assignment, allowing for an expansion of knowledge. This does not only apply to my experiences with summer assignments, but also applies to my overall experience as a student. When given the liberty to decide my own work, I am not only excited to work, but I am also more dedicated. When my education is in my hands, I produce some of my best work. Currently as a junior enlisted in a self led research class, I have learned so much about myself and the overall topic I am researching. Although at first the task at hand was daunting, I learned how to organize myself effectively and complete a thorough research project that I am happy with. By having the research project on my own, I am constantly thinking about it and I spend more time to work. Giving students the ability to decide their course of work is one of the most beneficial decisions a teacher can make for the future of a student.

Not only do students work harder when given the liberty to decide their assignments, but through self exploration, teachers builds strong, inquisitive minds. Some of the most successful people are regarded for their fame and success due to self exploration. In Benjamin Franklin's famous autobiography, he shares his experiences through self exploration. Growing up in a poor household, Franklin's father could not afford to send him to a traditional college education, but through Franklin's own personal endeavors and exploration, he became one of America's founding fathers, discovered lightning, and paved a legacy that is still remembered today. Simple self exploration can start with these summer projects. When a student is given their own freedom, remarkable results can follow. The purpose of a curriculum is to mend our future minds into strong, independent thinkers, so by implementing simple strides of self exploration, schools and teachers are able to mold the minds of successful students. In my own experiences, self exploration has made a remarkable impact. When I was 15 I started my first company, learning everything on my own with the help of a few mentors along the way. Not only did I grow as a person, but my knowledge for business also grew tremendously. Through the use of online resources, videos, and contacts, I was able to produce something I am truly proud of. The work I put in, was time I wanted to because I was truly passionate about what I was doing. That passion is what we need to strive for. From simple opportunities for self exploration during the summer to long term projects, as a society we need to move towards encouraging self education and self exploration.

The future is in the hands of my generation, and we must make the most of it. The overall benefit of students having their education in their hands, outweighs the potential negative repercussions. Some may predict that students may slack off when given the opportunity to create their own summer projects. While this is possible, when a student is pushed, surprising results follow. In addition, giving students that necessary push is how we can create a brighter future. Overall, enacting a policy in which students create their own summer projects not only creates inquisitive students now, but our leaders in the future. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
A1F525B4AAB7,"Although it may seem logical to have students do a teacher-designed project over the summer, it happens to cause students more harm than good. Students should be in control of their own projects over the summer. If the summer projects are created by students, then the thought process of them will promote creativity in a student. Another positive impact of having students create their own summer projects is that is raises the levels of responsibility within themselves. They would also be prepared for life after school if their summer projects were student-designed. Students would benefit more positively to designing their own summer projects as it would increase their creativity, aid them into being more responsible, as well as prepare them for adulthood.

Students should be in charge of their own summer project as it'll help them grow creatively. Since the projects are student-designed, then students would have to think outside of the box to create a project that will stand out among their fellow peers. If students were in charge of their own summer project, they would be motivated to learn new ways to apply their new knowledge to the world. Also, it gives the student the chance to explore areas of knowledge outside of the standard curriculum they are given, further more enhancing their creativity. For example, a student could learn editing skills and video design if they decided that their summer project was to create a video about the history of Shakespeare. Since the student was able to make their own rules to their project, the outcome of the project is more likely to benefit them creatively than if the project was to be teacher-designed. Not only do student-designed projects push the students to become more creative, but it also pushes another important factor onto them.

A student would become more responsible is they were to have student-designed summer projects. Due to the project being in the hands of the student, their grade would also be in their hands. This means that if the student failed to complete their project over the summer, their grade would suffer with them. Furthermore, students would have to schedule when they plan to complete their summer project, and how much time they will need to gather the materials and produce it. If they are unable to submit their project online, the student would need to become more organizational in order not to lose their project. An example would be a student receiving a poor grade on a project they underestimated the amount of time needed to complete it and failed to turn in on time, causing the student to be at fault due to a lack in responsibility. As it increases responsibility in a student, it aids them for handling the near future of adulthood.

Being in control of their own project would prepare students for life after school. A student might gain a sense of individuality from their peers since they had to create their own design for a project. Along side a sense of individuality will be the realization of how life really operates, as there are no guides to tell a person what to do in the long run. Being in charge of their own summer project will also prepare them for a work place environment, as the students realize that they need to find different ways to complete a given task if they were not given a way in the first place. In the future, when the student is employed, they will be able to sufficiently complete any work their boss gives them if the boss did not directly inform the student how. Allowing students to design their own summer project will help aid them in adulthood.

It would only be beneficial if summer projects were created by students and not teachers. The students creativity will increase as they are pushed to design a project that stands out among others. Also, they are more likely to have higher levels of responsibility as they are the ones who are in charge of their own grade. Lastly, students would be prepared for adulthood as they are given a better understanding of how life will work. Student-designed projects would aid students further in life than if they were given teacher-designed ones. After completing school, life no longer has a teacher as to instruct a person as to what to do next.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
76BF3852B313,"Student-designed projects are great, they persuade students to be more unique and creative on their project. There is an ongoing debate over whether summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. There are those who argue that teacher-designed projects are better, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, projects should be student-designed.

There are a variety of reasons why summer projects should be student-designed. Students are more creative than teachers. For example, I like to add more color and pictures to my project. When students work on project by their selves they tend to understand it better because there is no pressure on them. Furthermore, no one is telling the students what to read or write on their project. When a student designs there own project it looks easier to them, and it also builds their confidence up. Another reason summer projects should be student-designed is because they better the student skills. For example, when I go off too college the projects will be easier to me because Im already experienced, also if i was to do a presentation I would know what certain points I want to say, and what parts I would like to start from.

There additional reasons why a student-designed summer project is more beneficial. Students can show the project to their friends and family, and that would help because if the student is wrong on some parts of the project they have people around that can correct them. However, when students show their project to their friends and family that can help better the student presentation and social skills. Due to the summer being a break from school, students have a lot of time to work on the project. For example, no one is rushing the student, therefore, the student can add extra work. The summer gives the students a lot of time to be more unique. Also, summer projects that are student-designed are better because the teacher may want the students to turn the project in earlier than expected. Another additional reason is that student-designed projects may be easier, because the student might not understand how the teacher designed it, or may not understand the instructions. For example, if summer already started and the student did not understand the teacher instructions, the student can ask the teacher to email the instructions to them.

Although some may disagree, projects should be student-designed. During the summer student-designed projects are best because they better student's skills, student have a lot of time to work on the project, and students can understand the project better. There are those who argue that teacher-designed projects are best, but this is not true. Ultimately, student-designed projects are better because they persuade students be more unique and creative.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
F00EE807FD5E,"Summer is the time of year students get to relax from going to school for 10 months. Though many people think it is unfair to give them out, projects can be administered in the summer. Regardless, if projects are given out during the summer, students should be given the option to create their own projects. Student-designed projects allow students to think independently, give motivation to do the project, and allow the student to express themselves personally.

While teachers do an impeccable job teaching, a teacher-designed project continues institutionalized learning. Projects that allow students to construct them make room for independent thinking. Independent thinking has major benefits such as better responses in class, because students absorb the information they learn for topics they liked researching, and a desire to learn outside of the class room. Projects enhances independent thinking by allowing the student decide what beneficial topic they want their project to be on and what time frame they want to create the project in.

When a child is given the choice to do something on their own, a better outcome is seen. For instance, a child who is given a choice for what to eat for dinner is more likely to eat all of their food versus a child who is not given the choice. The same thing applies to a student and their project. Because students will be allowed to choose what to do their summer project on, they are more likely to complete the project. Student-designed projects also increases the effort put into the project. When a student is doing a project that they like, they are more likely to put in more effort versus a project that has been chosen for them to do over the time where a student is supposed to be having fun.

Teacher-designed projects are extremely general. They do not adhere to the feelings of specific students. On top of that, teacher-designed projects are like the same projects administered throughout the year which demolishes a creative experience. Students who create their own projects get to express themselves. Students express themselves by choosing projects which mean something to them whether it is short story to a diorama of the solar system. An example of this is the Personal Project which is distributed the last year of the IBMYP program. Students are given the choice of a topic to talk about and present is. Many students were motivated to do the project and present it because they were allowed to express what was important to them.

In conclusion, student-designed projects are more beneficial to one than a teacher-designed project. Creating one's own project allows independent thinking, which formulates a desire to learn without the push of a teacher. Additional reasons students should be allowed to choose their projects is because it increases motivation by making them want to complete a project they enjoy and because they can express their feelings through a personal connection with the project they are completing.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9AED627D6FDB,"Doing Summer Projects the Right Way

At many high schools, a massive controversy is in the making. As the summer is right around the corner, students are getting prepared for their summer projects. These summer projects are in place to make sure the students never stop learning, and to make sure they are prepared for next year's class. The problem is if these projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. The summer projects should be student-designed because they are easier to plan, benefits the students more, and less stressful.

The first reason why the summer projects should be student-designed is because they are easier to plan into the students' busy schedule. Everyone can agree that the summer time is went students are the busiest. Many go on vacations to foreign nations, visit families in other states, and the list goes on forever. By making the the projects student-designed, it gives the students the ability to look at what they got planned for the summer. The students then can make their projects fit around their schedule. If the project was teacher-designed, then the teacher would not know how to make it where it fits the busy schedules of the students. Therefore, these examples prove that it is better to have projects student-designed.

The second reason why it would be better to have student-designed projects is that it benefits the students more in several ways. Every student has a unique way of learning. Some students learn by listening. Others learn by using their eyes or by touch. By making these projects student-designed, the students can make them to where they can learn the most. An example would be if a visual learner had to make a project on the civil war, then he or she would make a presentation or anything that requires the eyes' engagement, helping them in the long run. If the project is teacher-designed, then the project will be made where it only benefits a small portion of the class. In conclusion, this shows that it benefits the students more to have student-designed projects.

The third reason why it would be beneficial for the students to have student-designed projects is because it is less stressful. by making the projects student-designed, the students know what they are getting into before the summer even begins. If the projects were teacher-designed, then the teachers might overload the students with a bunch of work thinking that it would be the best for the students. Students may have other projects to do for other classes, and this would make it hard for the students to put their best effort into the projects. Students may also have stress from problems not relating to school. An example would be a student who need to work over the summer to help pay the bills. He or she would prefer a project that is student-designed because it takes away that stress that would be with a teacher-designed project. Therefore, it would be a positive impact if the students got student-designed projects.

Many argue that teacher-designed projects would be better for the students. People claim that the teachers know their students well enough, that the students may design projects that are horribly made, or that teachers should have control over how the students learn. It might be true that teachers know their students really well, but the only person who knows the students the best are themselves. For the argument that projects will be horribly made, can be easily solved by having an outline which the students follow. They then make a project that follows that outline while making it their own way. These problems are also easily solved with the proof and evidence listed above, and it is clear that student-designed projects are ultimately better for the students.

In conclusion, because they are easier to plan, benefits the students more, and less stressful, summer projects should be student-designed and not teacher-designed. Teacher-designed projects hurt the students learning ability while student-designed projects help it. Now ask yourself if your children are learning to the best of their ability over the summer. Ask them if their summer projects are student-designed or teacher-designed. If they say that they have teacher-designed projects, make sure that problem is addressed knowing that it does not benefit your children in any way. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
2DA25C61D18D,"Have you ever found yourself being bored when doing a project? Have you found it pointless because you get the horrible feeling that you are not learning? It could be because it was designed by your teacher. Many schools, but not all, require students to complete summer projects in order to get them ready for the upcoming information in those upcoming classes. Many of those projects are teacher designed which various students tend to dislike because of the singular, required format. For example, many projects require students to only draw pictures, only write essays, or only build structures related to the certain topic. Many of these students tend to lack the motivation to complete those tasks because they feel uncomfortable doing an action they are inexperienced with. Even though teacher designed summer projects tend to broaden the student's skills by giving them tasks they are somewhat uncomfortable with, it is better for projects to be student designed so students can strengthen their confident skills, learn at their own pace, and have fun while efficiently studying the topic.

Student designed projects give students the choice to pick a format they feel comfortable with. This choice gives the student confidence in their ability to complete the project and strengthens a particular skill in use. For example, Generic_Name, my niece, decided to do drawings for her summer reading project last year. She would say that drawing her own version of the characters from her favorite book,

Diary of the Wimpy Kid , would helped her visualize the story in her own way so she could visualize effectively when reading books without pictures to guide her. When she completed her task, she felt so confident in her work and even said, ""I'm going to do so good on this project. I know my teacher is going to love it."" Because of this, it was noticeable that she obviously felt confident in her outstanding drawings. She even became a better drawer from it. She turned in her project and got an astounding grade on it. Overall, the experience she had with the project was very rewarding for her because she got a chance to showcase her confident drawings and had the productive opportunity to build on the skill she loved.

Student designed summer projects give students the ability to learn at their own pace while ultimately having fun. For example, two years ago, my former World History teacher, Mr Generic_Name, had us do a project over the summer about the most important events in world history. Fortunately, he gave the opportunity to choose our own format for the project. Luckily for my friend Generic_Name, he decided to complete the project in the form of a song, considering he was very musically talented. Over the summer he would plan when to work on it that best fit his schedule so he wouldn't be stressed to finish the song. He researched about the effects of World War II and finished his song in no time. He stated that it was one of the best projects he had ever completed because for the first time, he felt like he actually learned something while doing an activity that he loved and had fun with. This clearly shows the effects of giving students a choice in designing their own projects for the best learning experience.

Some may argue that teacher designed summer projects give students a chance to broaden and strengthen skills students are uncomfortable with, however, students don't learn that way. For example, this year in my AP Economics class, a peer of mine, Generic_Name, said she didn't understand the point of the summer project, which was to pick a book about economics, she chose the book

Freakonmics , and write an essay on how economic concepts apply to everyday life. This is also considering that essay writing is not her specialty. She loudly complained about how boring the project was and how it was extremely time consuming. She even stated she got nothing out of it. Because she didn't have fun, she didn't learn anything and was furious by this outcome. This undoubtedly shows that teacher designed projects make students feel like they don't learn anything and overall, make them feel bitter about the subject.

Overall, teacher designed projects don't give the students an efficient way of learning. Some students may find the project uninteresting and because of this, they may not learn the helpful information needed to help them with their classes. However, if teachers do include this option to student within the projects, it could give students the possibility of having fun and actually learning while they are strengthening skills they feel confident in. All teachers want is for their students to learn in an efficient manner in order to succeed, but that outcome won't be possible if teachers give out projects that don't include student decision making. If teachers want to achieve this outcome, they should give student different options to format their project in order for them to learn in the most efficient way so they can ultimately succeed academically and in the future.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
EBC02425174E,"Many students dread their summer projects and procrastinate what is intended to be a three month long project or book till mere hours before the bell rings on their first day back. However, the stereotypical teenager angst that resents the idea of summer homework can be sternly challenged due to the great benefit for students working their brains during their time off. Some say that summer projects would be more enjoyable and valuable to students if they were designed by their peers instead of teachers. I disagree and believe that the teacher of a particular course can give the best synopsis to their class and set straight the expectations and course load through the summer assignment. Summer projects are a great tool to keep students' brains stimulated over the break, and they should be teacher designed in order to provide students with a strong background on a topic that will be further discussed during the school year, help to prepare students for the style of a teacher that they may be unfamiliar with, and allows the student to view a glimpse of the rigor and expectations that accompany a particular course.

Summer projects are beneficial when they provide the opportunity for the student to learn more about a topic that will be discussed in their class during the year. It is essential that the students are given the opportunity to establish a strong framework that they can later build on with the help of their peers and teachers. Because this background is so vitally important I believe that it is the most beneficial for the summer project that will guide the student on their quest for more knowledge is designed by the teacher who knows exactly what topics will be covered in their class and what would be in the utmost importance to get an early understanding on. During the summer before Freshmen year my English class required a summer assignment on the Odyssey be completed. At first I was bummed out because I did not want to spend my summer doing homework, however it proved to be wildly beneficial and I enjoyed it. The summer assignment was designed by my English teacher and asked us the look more into specific characters and stories that she knew we would have a test on shortly after returning to school. Because the I completed the assignment that my teacher crafted with care, I was beyond prepared for our test on the Odyssey and all in class discussions on the matter.

Teachers even within the same discipline can have drastically different teaching styles, which is another reason why I believe that summer assignments should be curated by the teacher. A summer assignment made by that teacher should provide a glimpse into that particular teacher's style and allows the student to see early on what their new teacher places emphasis on while grading. During a student's schooling career it is unlikely that they will ever encounter a teacher whos style is identical to another teacher that they have had which is why it is of the utmost importance that students are allowed the opportunity to get to know their knew teacher and what the teacher will expect of their class before they even step foot in their classroom. For example my Freshmen and Sophomore year history teachers both were amazing history teachers but my individual learning preferences meshed much better with one of them. The different styles of teaching work better for different students depending on how they best learn, but it is important for the student to get a glimpse of their new teacher through the summer assignment.

Summer assignments should also reflect the rigor of their corresponding course while setting forth the expectations that the teacher will have for their students in the class. Students gaining a general idea on how hard a particular class will be is extremely valuable if done so over the summer because then that allows for time at the beginning of the school year for the student to potentially switch to a different difficulty level if so desired. Because the summer assignment could potentially determine if the student drops the class to move levels it is integral that the assignment be as class to the demand and standard of the actual class as possible. For this reason I believe that the teacher would be able to give the student a better accurate impression of the rigor of their class than a fellow student could give their peer. For example a summer assignment for AP U.S. History would be a great way for the teacher to open their future students horizon on the course and give an idea on how much homework that should be expected, the requirements for analytical pieces of writing like a data based question, and the overall expectations of the class.

Summer assignments are a great way to get students' brains moving over the long break and can be beneficial in many different ways. These benefits like increased background knowledge and exposure to new teaching styles are hinged upon weather or not the assignment is made by students or teachers. Summer assignments should be teacher designed because it shows the student the rigor of the course, enables students to gain a strong background on subjects that will be discussed during the year, and helps to expose students to the style of their new teacher.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8

Summer, one of the greatest times in a high school students life. A chance to take a break from school and sit back and relax in the warm summer heat. There are many ways teachers try to find a way for students to be able to keep up some of the things they learned during the break, one of the ways is assigning projects, should these projects be teacher designed or student designed? In my opinion they should be student designed. There are many reasons why but there are three reasons that really stand out to me .Students will find a fun and inspiring way to make a project, students also know what its like to be a teenager in the summer and not only doing the project but designing the project will help the student learn.

Firstly, students know what it's like to be a teenager in the summer. Just the thought of the warm sun, cool water and late nights gives me chills down my spine. Just the idea of summer gives everyone a light happy feeling in their stomachs. Summer is a time for freedom, and many students hate the idea of the freedom taken away by a project a teacher gave them, which makes them not want to do that project at all. If students were to make the project they would think about what they do in the summer and how the summer makes them feel. They would most likely design a project that kids would do because they have an idea of an teenage life in the summer.

Secondly, Designing the project will also be beneficial for the students to learn. They will learn how to design something and also, while designing the project they will learn more about the information inside the project. The students that usually do better in classes are ones that when they get it and understand what to do, they then teach it to someone else in the class that is struggling on it more. That is basically the same concept for students giving the ability to design this summer project.

Lastly, in my opinion I believe students are more creative than teachers, especially when they are given a teachers task. I believe that when designing the project, the students will make the project fun and inspiring along with educational. I believe that students will make a project so fun an interesting that in the summer when kids sit down and do their project they won't even realize they are doing an project. Earlier this year my teacher gave my class a project over Christmas break that students made the year before. She also gave us a project for over Thanksgiving break that she made. The difference between the two projects was unbelievable. The one over Christmas break I actually wanted to do, while the one over Thanksgiving break I did not want to do at all. The one over Christmas break was fun and I actually did that one to my full abilities, and learned quite a bit doing it . Other than the one over Thanksgiving break where I just half did it and barley learned anything. I also saw a diffrence of people turning in their project. The one over Christmas a majority of the class did it, while the one over Thanksgiving break just a few people did it.

In conclusion, I believe that students designing the project over the summer will cause more productivity in the projects getting done, more students will keep up their education in the summer and students who get to design the project will learn so much just from designing it.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
A3F896A51CEA,"Should students design they're summer projects or should teachers do. I think the teachers should do it, why. My first opinion is that the teachers will know what he/she is struggling with, and the teachers would know what assignments will help that student. My second opinion is that, Teachers will know what to do to help out a struggling student, because they been doing it for years. My third opinion is if the students designs they're own summer project they might pick a project that might not help them. The summer projects should be design from a teacher not a student because the students won't know what their doing.

The first reason why is because, Teachers has been working with they're students all year long. So that means the teachers will know what each of his/her students are struggling with, So when teachers are about to pick out a summer project he/she will know whats the best project for his/her students. This way the students won't have the same problems next year.

The second reason why is because, Teacher will already know what to do. Teachers has been assigning projects for years, They will know what project will benefit his/hers students. If a student designs the project it might not benefit most students or it might not make any sense for other students. Also a student doesn't have the same experience from a teacher that has been working with students for years.

The last reason why is because, a student will not know whats the best project for them self or won't take it serous. A student might not want to do a summer project so he/she might design a project that will be easy and less time to finish. Also they might design a project that won't help them with there problems. It's also the teachers job to do it not the students.

So my opinion is that, teachers should design the summer project and not the student. Because teachers has more experience than a student, will know whats the best project to help out a struggling student, and a student might pick a project that might not help them out.               ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
8C0D1A4261C0,"Work assigned over the summer is very much dreaded by students, but does that mean students should be the ones designing these assignments? A majority of schools assign summer assignments to ensure that students still receive an education during their time off from school. While there is much debate on whether the student should have the right to design these projects, the best option is for these projects to be teacher-designed. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it ensures that students will work efficiently, understand the topic, and that the assignments will be safe and appropriate.

In order to have quality work produced, and productive students, summer projects must be teacher-designed. Having set rules and requirements created by teachers, ensures that students will complete the tasks to a high level. During the summer, students would rather not have educational work to focus on, but projects created by the teacher enforces these students to do so. If these projects were student-designed, it could potentially allow them to finesse the system, and create a project that does not require much thinking and work. Student-designed projects also leaves room for error. Projects constructed by students leaves the door open for many mistakes, which will ultimately hurt the student in the end. This prevents students from working efficiently and fully understanding the topic they are working on. The goal of teacher-designed projects is to not control the students, but to make sure that the students are obtaining knowledge, understand the assignment, and are producing high quality work. Students may be confused or have numerous of questions with student-designed projects since there are no specific guidelines and rules, so having teacher-designed projects are ideal because they explicitly state what they are looking for.

Teacher-designed projects come with a list of guidelines and criteria that prevents students from working on something that could potentially be dangerous or inappropriate. If students had the ability to come up with their own projects, it gives them an opportunity to select a topic that could be unsafe or not school appropriate. This is especially important for science projects or English assignments. Giving students the power to choose their projects could be risky when it comes to these two subjects. For science projects, students could end up harming themselves with unsafe chemicals or substances because a lack of a rubric and criteria created by the teacher. For English assignments, students might choose controversial topics that are not appropriate for the school environment, but would not know due to a lack of strict guidelines. The possibility of projects being unsafe and inappropriate are not likely if they are designed by teachers.

Some may argue that assignments should be student-designed because it allows the student to express themselves creatively through their work. By displaying their creativity and thought process, it makes the idea of having work over the summer more enjoyable. However, having projects that are created by the student leaves room for interpretation, which could confuse students, and may take them in the wrong direction. In addition, some students may not be that creative, and cannot come up with a project on their own. Teacher-designed assignments still allow students to show what they know, but with stricter guidelines to ensure that quality work is being produced from the students. If students are allowed to design their own projects, it might result in an end product that does not meet the standard of work it should, especially since students would rather not complete work in the summer. Because of these issues and flaws, having student-design projects is not a wise choice.

Having teacher-designed projects is the best option for both teachers and students because it guarantees that students are working hard to meet the requirements of the assignment, comprehending the topic of the project, and working on projects that are both safe and school appropriate. In order for schools to ensure that students continue learning during their break, the most effective project for students to work on, is one designed by teachers.       ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
FCEFFF74C652,"Every summer, many students are sent home with work to to over their summer break. Not only are these projects often very labor intensive, but they are also put together by teachers, The students don't have a say in the formation of the projects. These summer projects should be designed by the students themselves because they know their brains better that anybody else, they will be more likely to complete something that they put together, and summer is supposed to be a relaxing time, so easygoing projects that are student-made could help keep students away from stress in the summer.

Every student learns differently, so designing a project to fit their needs and their learning style would not only help them complete the project, but it would also help students learn more. For example, if one student in a class is a visual learner, and the other is an auditory learner, the visual learner will have an advantage on a project that is assigned ever summer and made out of poster board and pictures. This will also cause the visual learner to obtain information on the project more easily, while the auditory learner could gradually fall behind in school every summer. Even if a teacher took a poll to see what kind of learner each student thought themselves to be, there would not be one learning type that would be unanimous throughout a classroom or a school. This is a major obstacle that comes with distributing the same teacher-designed project to every student as a summer assignment.

There are very few students around the globe who enjoy doing homework given to them by their teachers, but what if the students were the architects behind the masterpieces of homework and projects? Students, knowing that they put the powerpoint, poster, or worksheet together, might be more than motivated to complete the assignment. People may argue that a student being able to design their own assignment might not work out beautifully because they may know things that are usually not given to them on a normal worksheet. However, students will quickly realize that what is easiest for them is not enough, and they will need to challenge themselves throughout these assignments to make sure that they are ready for the school year that is to come. Also, students would not be given free reign to do anything that they please, teachers would provide guidelines and rubrics to make sure that students are incorporating the correct information and at the right difficulty.

Every student looks forward to summer as a time to take a break from school, have fun with their family and other companions, and to simply relax. Assigning rugged and stressful projects for students to complete over their few months of relaxation could result in building stress and anxiety, which can lead to depression and things much worse. If students were to design their own projects and know exactly what they need to do and when they need to do it, they may not need to stress a great deal about the amount of time they have and about how much it will take away from their summer. This will ensure that high school students are still being high schoolers and having fun with friends and family. Some teachers could argue that they will stress about any project that they are assinged, but they have to understand that students know what they enjoy doing, and what they do not enjoy doing. Therefore, students could tailor their projects to be fun and stress free.

Students should be allowed to be the lead architect on the glorious building that is their summer assignment in order to make sure that they are completing work that keeps them away from stress and learning in the way that their brain knows how to learn. If students were able to design their own summer projects, a mass change in the way scholars learn could be coming, and it would be for the better.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9EAE8BE46F4F,"With long breaks, students tend to forget important information they've learned throughout the school year. Summer projects are required for some schools to keep the student's brain on track during the long break. But, what nobody thinks about is, who should design these projects? More over, Should teachers or students design these projects? Many people argue summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed; however, no one thinks about a student/teacher-designed project.

Projects made by students and teachers can cover the relevant topics with creative ideas such as: phone projects, video game projects, and sports projects. This can create diversity amoungst all projects and help the student have an exciting experience. Now-in-days Students spend their daily lives on their phones, assigning a project on their phones would make it easier for the student to navigate and be comfortable with the environment their in. For example, a teacher could create a class account on social media and post or request projects during the summer, and because students are always on their phone, they should be able to complete the projects assigned. Motivating a student to stay on track can be quite difficult if the material is boring or uninteresting. A student and teacher collaboration can grasp both sides of the spectrum and pull thoughts, ideas, and examples and put them all in one to make a great project idea.

Throughout my junior year in high school i've done many projects and essays in most of my classes and they've all been teacher-designed. The most freedom i've probably gotten is just picking which assigned topic i'd like to write about or do research on but thats pretty much it, I'm very limited. For example, in my second period my teacher assigns many essays on politics or current events. Not everyone is interested in those topics so some of the students my class dont take the time to research and just copy and paste information found on websites. This makes students lazy and in the end they dont learn anything, they only thing they've learned is a bad habit. A recommendation i could make to my teacher is have more variety, more options, or even maybe a topic more interesting to provide to his students.

Another great teacher of mine, Generic_Name, has the most variety and is willing to work with a student. Although he assigns teacher-designed essays, we have the freedom to pick our topics and what we get to write about. He helps morph your ideas into complex thoughts to satisfy the writer and the rubric. Furthermore, helping the student to think deeper and be interested in doing their essay. The teacher having some flexibility allows the student to enjoy what they're doing and finish their task.

All in all, students and teachers can be affected greatly if projects were student/teacher-designed. A collaboration between students and teachers can create a connection leading to a greater outcome and success. Teacher-designed projects can also create a stressful environment for the students, and allowing student ideas to flow into teacher-designed projects creates a healthy environment for students minds. Students and teachers can build off each other and have a great relationship because, ""

415C68EF76E4,"During the summer break some students may forget all about what they've learned. Schools are requiring students to complete projects during the summer to help them keep learning. Students should be able to chose what they would like to do for their project.

Students look forward to their summer break because they dont have to do anything. Well teachers want them to continue learning during their break. If the kids were able to choose what they want to do on the project, they would actually do it unlike if the teachers chose a boring project. Kids are embellish and like to do their own thing.

Also they get a new teacher every year. Their new teacher could expect more than the old teacher or grade it differently.

If the teacher chose the project, the students might not do it because its boring or lame. If the student chose what the project is about then it's easier for the teacher to grade it and the students would enjoy it more. All the students would have different projects so it could be like a science fair and they get to judge whose project is the best.

Students through out all ages are creative. Some love to draw,write,and record. This generation is all about phones. They could make a documentary or even a YouTube video about whats going on in the world. Doing projects they get to chose may excite some students and make them want to do it. They could also do their project based off how their summer went.

2E1266682F4A,"Summer projects should be teacher designed because students will do there projects when they are on break. Because they can learn new things it can help them with things they have not know about. Some students will not want to do a project when they are on break because they think it will not help them if it not student designed projects. Although It can help them learn new things they have not learn before in school or any place they have been to before.

They can also share things they have learn during their break. Learing can be fun to students because they learn new things, and get ready for school when they come back. Students can show that they learn something new when they do their project by doing it. Doing projects can help students learn things they have never learn about it helps then know more about things they have learn about.

During students break they do a summer project that is teacher designed. They can show what they have learn about in their project they did. It get's them ready for school when they come back even when they have more projects to do it gives them ideas on how to do a project.

For example students do projects to help them improve on their learning skills. When students learn something that is fun, or just learning it helps them with many things such as on a project, and writhing a story about what they have learn about over their break.

Summer projects should be teacher design because it helps students on there break to continue learning different things they have not learn about.

6D0960F54CC0,"Have you ever thought to yourself about how summer projects affect students? Some schools have started to require students to complete a summer project, Should the projects be student-led or teacher-led? The following reasons are why I believe summer projects should be student-led: It would allow the students to broaden their topic range, It would make sharing the projects more enjoyable, and It would allow students to reflect on their summer.

Giving students the opportunity to choose the topic of their project would allow the students to talk about everything they did over the summer. This allows students to choose anything they did, from taking a peaceful vacation to skydiving over Generic_City. Students would be able to adventure and begin an amazing life that has so many roads to follow. Many students would benefit from the projects and would have many stories to tell.

Another reason students would enjoy self-led projects is because giving the students freedom to share their projects with other classmates. Sharing the projects would give students many things to talk abou when they come back to school and see eachother. Students by sharing could teach new things about eachother such as what their hobbies are. With students sharing their projects it forms new bonds and create new friendships between many unlikely people. Sharing projects would bring people together more and overall be great for everyone, it gives students necessary life skills such as: public speaking, communication skills, and essentially confidence.

Allowing students to conduct their projects would be beneficial to students becuase they would have time to sit down and think about all they did. The project itself isn't really about the actual project, It's about students thinking and knowing they made pretty awesome memories over the summer. The projects shouldn't be about school work such as math or a history project. It should be about the students and helping them do their best to live their young lives to the fullest. In the end the students would be out in the world making memories with people in their community, they would be making a difference in the world they could travel and help with disaster relief, students could make a change in this world and the next.

While some people may say that teacher-led projects could be best. I believe they are wrong, Nothing could make student mental and physical health go up other than to actually give students the freedom to complete a project and show they made a difference over the summer. Making the difference wouldnt have to end when summer ends students could make changes year-round. In theory students starting to develop their own projects would lead to students just wanting to make a change and go adventure. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

Some people think that taking a break won't do them harm at but you maybe allowing others to get ahead of you in life. The time you have on a break should be spent wisely not goofing around. During summer kids tend to study less which in return lowers brain activity which is why the should have a summer project to keep them busy. This summer project should be chosen by the students of the class room.

Teachers think students can't handle certain situation but who better to chose what the students can handle then them self for this project. When students are given the option to pick their project they will feel much more motivated to accomplish this assignment if they can choose what it is going to be about. This motivation will cause the students to work harder for their grade and strengthen the skills they already know or new ones need for this assignment. The students could come up with this summer project together so that everybody will feel equally involved want to do their best. The standard for the project should be high so be won't be able to show up with a barely worked on assignment and pass. This assignment or project should build on skills that have been used through out the class.

When kids have summer projects they could use it as a opportunity to build on skills need for a future career or maybe not so strong at like time management or mathematics. This extra time spent on the project will result in a positive change in grades and thinking. The brain is like a muscle the more you work it the stronger it gets so just like a muscle the less exercise you give it the more softer and weaker it is. There is more to just improving your work ethic and increasing brain productivity when it come to doing projects over the summer. When a kid is working on a project they are less likely to do something that can get them involved in dangerous or life threaten events.

When kids have less time to do things they will ultimately value their time more and start to make better decisions. This will lead to better planning in the future and time spent doing something productive. They will also start to think about how this summer project be able to help them in their future career options or college and branch out in try learning new skills to accomplish these task in life. When letting a teacher pick the summer project kids may not feel as motivated to do it or see it as stupid but, the teacher will strengthen their skills in that subject.

The project will lead to a better use of time over summer for most kids. This assignment will keep the kids working on their skills. This may even help kids see this project in a better view of why they have to do this. Their summers will be ten times more productive then they were before.

A8BF1D0AA57F,"Have you ever been assigned a project over a long break? Summer projects are a good way to continue the learning from the school year into the long break, but if not done right, it can lead to the students not trying or learning anything new. It's not very conventional, but if you are assigned the right thing, then it can be beneficial. I believe that the summer projects should be student-designed because they should be based on what the students need clarification on, students learn better when they get to teach themselves, and allows the students to be creative.

Summer projects should be student-designed because the projects should be beneficial to the individual student; not to a whole class that has different learning capacities. The students projects would be designed for specifically what they need clarification on from the previous school year. This should help the student gain knowledge of the project subject to help them succeed in the future school year. For example, if a student didn't understand human geography but was assigned a project in math, than it wouldn't help them gain knowledge for their upcoming school year; however, if a student didn't understand human geography and was assigned a human geography project, then it would help them succeed in the future. If the students designed their own summer projects then there would be a greater effect than the whole class doing the same subject project.

Students tend to learn better when they're the creator of their project and subject guidelines. Personally, I tend to work better by myself, on a subject that I need to improve my knowledge on. This gives me motivation to learn the subject where I lack knowledge, to help benefit me for my upcoming tests or even class. I asked multiple other classmates about their stance on this, and they also agree that working on something you enjoy learning about while working alone is way more beneficial than a standard summer project. It could be argued that some students don't learn when they don't have guidelines. The weakness in that is if students are given the opportunity to design their own project, then they will be able to retain the information more easily.

Allowing students to design their own summer projects would increase the creativity of the project. This would improve the experience of the student and the teacher. This improves the experience of the student because it allows them to learn and expand thier knowledge on something they like instead of a forced subject. In addition, this improves the experience for the teacher because they get to learn new things too. In addition, they won't be grading the same project for every individual person. Students that design their summer projects have the opportunity to captivate their teachers attention with an astonishing amount of information.

Summer projects should be student-designed because they should be based on what the students need clarification on, students learn better when they get to teach themselves, and allows the students to be creative.

DA1C7D2E4652,"Now trust me I know projects are not exciting and having them in the summer sounds terrible, but what if I told you having summer projects could be fun. If you got to pick who designed your summer projects who would you pick: teacher-designed or student-designed? Having student-designed projects is so unique and a great way to make projects more interesting. How about we switch it up a bit and instead of teachers creating the projects students do. Making summer projects student-designed would make it stress free on students, give them freedom, and it would make learning fun.

I'm currently a high school student, so trust me I know how stressful school projects can be. If students designed these summer projects all the stress would go away. You would get to do the project on your own time and you'd get to pick what you want to learn about. Students wouldn't make the projects super hard or long because it is summer break and that's their time to relax. A teacher would normally give you a rubric or a set of guidelines you have to follow, but now you get to make it how you want.

The possibilities are so endless if students got to build summer projects. You'd be able to pick how you want to do things and you could really bring out your creative side. It's the students break, this is when they don't want to think about school, so they should be able to decide whats best for them. You wouldn't have a list of things you need to follow you would be able to do whatever you wanted to. This would be such a great opportunity for students to enjoy learning and make it interesting.

I know I've definitely gotten a topic to research about and it wasn't interesting to me at all. Having to do a project on something you find boring won't give you the motivation you'd need to push through it. If students got to pick what they wanted to learn, they wouldn't mind having these projects during summer break. Finding something to learn about that really interests you would make the experience as a whole ten times better. Maybe you're doing a poster on something you learned about in history, you get to enjoy learning about it and make that poster however you want to.

Student-designed summer projects overall sound like something that would satisfy every student. Having teacher-designed projects would most likely be more organized and efficient, but students would have more fun and enjoy learning if it was student designed.

09935EBDBB7C,"The concepts our public schools come up with are great and efficient! Schools like to push their students to succeed and to be educated. For this reason, some schools require students to complete projects over the summer to assure that they retain the material and information they learned during the school year; furthermore, these projects should be teacher-designed. The best reasons that support this claim are that these projects are, in fact, beneficial to a students education as they help them retain information and will help students study, these projects can offer an opportunity for students to earn extra credit the next school year, and because a teacher will know a students academics strengths and weaknesses, a student will not.

Extra credit is something a student may need to graduate, it is something universities look at, and it can bolster a students grade. These teacher-designed summer projects are a great concept to introduce into schools as one of the countless opportunities for students to excel and succeed. A summer project would be a project grade, a grade that can massively improve a students grade. Following after that, their GPA would increase do the positive grade. This is great for students, which is why it is the first reason as to why teachers should design the summer projects rather than students design them.

Secondly, if projects are designed by teachers, they can help teachers understand where their students level of understanding is at. A student completing the project is more than a grade as a teacher can see where a students weaknesses and strengths are. If a teacher can find the material a student does and does not understand, they can reinforce and reteach the student the material in a way that suits the student better. If a student designed their own project, they would not know how to, as they would not know their own weaknesses and strengths as much as a teacher will, making teacher-designed projects during the summer much more efficient.

Thirdly, teacher-designed projects will help students study and retain information; summer vacation is about 2-3 months long, students can forget important information during that time. A project that focuses on the core subject a student was learning will keep the material, information and concepts fresh in that students mind. This is crucial to do, as if the student is unprepared the next school year, they will fall far behind. If a student designed their project to help study, they would make it easier on themselves by not including the material they don't understand so they can learn it. Nobody can learn what they already know, which is why students should not design their own projects and why teachers should design their projects.

However, that's not to say that even with teacher-designed projects there aren't faults. Even with studying and completing a project during the summer, a student can still forget the material. A student may know their own weaknesses and strengths and could be working on their weaknesses. And a teacher may make the decision to not grade the projects at all. That's also including that some teachers may actually tell students to make the project themselves as that allows the student to truly look at what makes the subject difficult for them, it allows the student to learn about the subject, and it helps the student to help the teacher understand what made the subject difficult for them.

In conclusion, its best teachers design summer projects. While students can do it to and learn for themselves, a teacher is more skilled in this area of education and would help a student more than hinder them. A teacher giving extra credit, a project that challenges the student to help them retain the information, and a project that helps the teacher understand a students strengths and weaknesses is vital to a students success.

E95AA3E3AC4B,"There are many schools that require students to complete a summer project. Most of these projects are either student designed or teacher designed. However, these summer projects should be designed by students all of the time. The projects should be designed by students because they would show each students creativity and passion but also show their ability to work on something independently.

First, the ability for students to design projects would allow them to express their creativity in unique ways. If each student designs a project there would be countless different creative and unique versions. For example, one student might make a movie for his project while another student creates a podcast. This creativity would not only make projects more interesting but students may also enjoy them more because of the creative freedom. On the other hand, if the project was teacher designed there would less variation and a lot of of the same boring and bland projects. Clearly, summer projects should be student designed so students can express their creativity.

Secondly, if students designed their projects they would have the ability to do projects about something they're passionate about. If students did their projects on what they were interested in they would most likely do a lot better job and put more time into it. For example, a student who is interested in cars would put more effort into a project about cars rather than if a teacher assigned him a project about wildlife. In addition, this project about wildlife would probably end up not expressing creativity and lacking information because there would be no passion for the project. Also, the ability for a student to do research on a topic that interests them allows for them to learn about something that could be a potential career choice in the future. While researching a student may learn that the topic is not quite what they thought it was or may learn that it's something they wanna continue to gain more knowledge about and make a career of it one day. Obviously, summer projects should be student designed, so students can learn about their passions and be motivated to do a better job.

Lastly, a student designed project would show their ability to work on something independently. If student designed more of the workload falls onto the student than the teacher. The ability to design and complete an entire project without any teacher help would take massive amounts of independent work skills. In addition, the ability to be independent is very important, and one day students will be out on their own without any teacher or adult to show them the way. This project has potential to teach students how to do things independently. However, if teacher designed the students would have everything laid out for them but that is nothing like the real world in, which a person will have to do everything on their own. All in all, the potential to learn how to do things independently is massive with a student designed project.

Many schools have summer projects that must be completed over the break and some of these projects are teacher designed. Although, when teacher designed these projects lack creativity, interest from students, and independent work skills. Therefore, these summer projects should be student designed so that they are creative, interest the students, and teach students how work independently.  ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
120AEADB58BC,"Imagine going to the last day of the school year. Imagine the fun summer that is waiting for the span of about two months. Now... imagine enjoying the last week of the summer vacation, but then realizing there is a summer project assigned by one of the classes due on the first day back. Following a teacher's directions while doing a school project can be difficult some times, especially when the teacher did not give their email/contact information regarding on the project. Therefore, who is going to help explain the instructions? Projects should be fun to do, not tedious based on teacher's instructions. So why let their minds go to waste as the years go by, when they can explore the world through a more interactive, more attractive kind of way? Summer projects should be student-designed because it shows a creative aspect in specific students' minds, it can help them stay on top of the assignment at hand while being interested, and it helps the teachers themselves by looking at different ones from different people and viewing the topic in different perspectives.

Creativity is where the mind of most people take a different turn on certain topics. Creativity should not be kept in a box, it should be someplace else: a wall, a canvas, paper, books, music- everywhere and anywhere it can and should be, as long as it is not crammed inside; sitting there as the dust falls on the area, leaving it gray. Although some students may say that they are not creative, or not that innovative- but they most certainly are, they just need a small extra push in the right route. The reason why they are so negative on being creative is because that little part of the brain labeled 'creativity' is covered in dust. Their minds are plagued by the dust, and they are not reaching their full potential of creativity. Creativity is how a person views the world through their eyes; not through their friends' eyes, or through their parents, or school, it is through their own. It is imperative that students really take a try at being creative because it opens their eyes to a world full of other possibilities. They will see the world in all of its colorful splendor. Homework assignments, classwork... all boring assignments when the teachers give specific instructions on how to do them. Not very creative, and not that very thought-provoking either. It bores the class being swamped with regular assignments. But, when a group project comes around, why is that subject the only one being touched on through creativity? That, is very limiting. Every assignment should have an option; an option that can give a better grade on creativity than a normal, typed up/written assignment because it is important to not keep the creativity stuck inside the students' minds. All while they are touching up on their creativity, they are more invested at the task assigned to them.

Investing time, is time consuming. To be fair, it is supposed to help others be more organized, or to be more punctual, but how? Sure, the teachers can say that it is going to help them continue learning throughout the summer- that is filled with fun plans along with enjoying time socializing with others, but everyone knows that they are going to do it either the first week of summer or the week before it is due. No in-between. Summer is supposed to be enjoying, not filled with dread and anxiety of a school project. But, if a little creativity is sprinkled through the instructions, then students will be a little less stressed and anxious about finishing the project because they are the ones who are making the rules and the guidelines of the task. That, is more eye-opening than paperwork that relatively looks similar to parents' taxes and bills. Adults always tell the 'young ones' to do something that interests them more. Sports? Whichever appeals to their eyes and their physique and how much they can take. How many times has someone asked, ""what do you like?"" Countless of times. How many times have they actually answered with a straightforward answer? Sometimes. Being interested on assignments are important, because this gives students more elbow room to work with than a structurally four-by-four square box with a pencil, eraser and paper. It helps them work with an open mind, it helps them stress less and turn in the project on the first day back, brimming with confidence. Creativity is to be shown to others, including the teachers who assigned the task over the summer.

Classes can either be a very hands-on type of experience or a very claustrophobic one. Teachers are somewhat under appreciated. They are either too strict or they are just simply ""fun"" to hang around- they can be boring and monotone or they can be interesting and colorful. Everyone has been through a lot of teachers, but when have they ever been through a teacher who was strict, yet fun at the same time? Very few have. It is like

Goldilocks , when she tries each porridge, each chair, then each bed. Those teachers make everything ""just right"" for students. When assignments come around, every teacher is staring at the same black and white sheets of paper, but if they were to look at different ones- different styles of writing, different colors used, different methods tackling the subject, they would not have to strain over Times New Roman font text or illegible handwriting. Overall, it benefits the teachers by showing how the students viewed the assignments and how effective it was when it was assigned.

Finally, students should have their summer projects based from their own rules because it helps them focus more, it helps them take a break from the regular classwork, and it helps teachers have a refresher to look at. It benefits everyone in the long run. It gives a sense of accomplishment because they did well on the summer assignment.

Students deserve the chance to prove that they can really be trusted to engage in their education in their unique and exciting ways, they should not be trapped into a small project that teachers grade all the same.

Many people would argue that teacher designed projects are better for students as they provide a clear and easy to follow rubric and guidelines for students to follow. While it is true that a clear outline and specifications would create an easier project for the students and teachers, is the point of a project not to challenge the students to work harder and show off what they know and can do? Student designed projects would not hamper the students by making each project a copy of the last through students following the same guidelines and thinking the same ways to complete the project. Students should control their own project and make it unique and their own special version of a basic idea that the teacher can then grade on a case by case basis instead of treating each project as something that must conform to fit specific rules. Allowing students the ability to truly have freedom is a far superior benefit than that of easier grading and simple goals in a narrow range of a teacher designed project.

Student based projects written without a strict rubric in mind will promote creativity and free thought in the students that have to create these projects. If each student is allowed to be the manager and creator of their own works then the students would feel more invested in their efforts and more careful and diligent in what they produce for their project. Students will likely think of new and exciting ideas to implement in their own ways and bring a new level of entertainment and creative thinking into what could potentially be a boring project. Students would almost certainly develop fun, intriguing, and totally unique ways of solving problems, showing off skills, and any other topics that they could think of. Summer projects could only be enhanced beyond what they are now by allowing students the creative and physical freedoms to complete their projects in the ways that they seem fit and are passionate about.

If students were allowed to design their own projects over summer then they would take more initiative and control over their own education. Students being forced to adhere to a code of guidelines and mandatory pieces in their projects would take away control from the students and force them to do a project thats been done before just with different words. Allowing students to take control over their education would also help to bring about an end to a problem many students will no doubt face; procrastination, as students would make their projects something fun and look forward to working on. In addition to ending procrastination, student designed projects would also mean students would generally work harder and care more about their projects as these would be tasks that they poured their heart and soul into, they would be individually responsible for their own success and feel that they should work harder and give more effort into this project that they alone thought of, created, and worked hard on. Student designed projects are no doubt the future of school work during he summer break partly because of their ability to give the students the pride of control and the strong sense of initiative that simply does not come from a strict, teacher designed summer project.

A last detail that proves student based projects are superior is that they give the students complete and total freedom over what to make, how to make it, and when to make it. This means that students would not be restricted to doing a certain task, in a certain way, at a certain time merely to fit with the guidelines of the project that they were thoughtlessly assigned. The freedom to create what they, the students, want is a feeling of euphoria for students, a breath of fresh air in the stale and often controlling school environment. Allowing students to have the freedom of choice, especially over summer when the last thing a student wants is to be burdened with a teachers strict code of demands for a very narrow minded project with simple goals, is a feeling that empowers the students and makes them feel as though their opinions, interests, and personalities truly matter to their schools. Allowing summer projects to be far more than narrow teacher created silhouettes of topics students dont care about could only help the classes and school.

To conclude this argument school projects that are assigned over the summer should be totally and wholly student designed with limited specific instruction by the teachers. Firstly, an open ended project without a strict rubric would clearly promote creativity and free thought in the students that must complete said work. Second, students would show more control and initiative over their own education and ways of completing broad assigned tasks. Lastly, students would be granted the freedom to complete and enhance their education and projects with their own unique interests and special considerations. This quite clearly proves that summer projects being teacher designed are inferior to those projects that are thought of, designed by, enhanced by, and supported by individual students and their individual personalities. All teachers and schools should absolutely adopt this doctrine of free choice and open thought in all summer projects.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
839FBFBB7054,"Students and teachers as well can all agree school tends to be very stressful. When summer comes along it gives everyone a opportunity to relax, put our stress from school aside, and just have fun during our break. On the other hand,not everyone gets to enjoy summer as much. Certain schools require students to complete a summer project to assure they continue learning during their break. The main debate is if these projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed.

Students young minds have so much creativity and potential to design their own project idea to make it a interesting and fun way of learning, but still being able to meet the requirements to get a good grade. Students designing their own projects lets them expand their knowledge to show what they already know, to create their project. A lot of students will dread having to complete a summer assignment. Some may feel it gets in the way of having time off from school,so designing it themselves will give them more freedom to make it not as boring by using their creativity to come up with a unique idea. Teachers also have a lot of stress going on and often have a lot of work to do with grading papers, this gives them time to relax by not having to worry about what to design for their students.

Students can also help one another by sharing ideas and working together. They have the choice whether to make it a big design or a small design and have a variety of options to chose from. While working on their design they may also discover new things in the process from research and learn more. It's more excitement to the students to see what they come up with and theyll be more eager to show it off. Students can see this as a challenge to try and come up with a creative design and be competitive.

On the other hand, it's understandable if some may feel that a teacher-designed assignment will be the better choice, given the fact that students just want to enjoy their summer break. Some students can fear having to design their own assignment could possibly add more stress from having to come up with a worthy project. To sum it all up a student-designed assignment would be a better fit for students and have more positive factors than having a teacher-designed assignment.           ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
F7046A9A968A,"Some school systems require hear students to finish projects over the summer. Simply to be sure that they are constantly learning and remaining information. This is a great idea, but how should this be executed? Should the projects be teacher or student designed? Giving the student the ability to create their project would encourage them to explore more in depth or maybe even new interests. Along with this this it would force the student to be creative, an otherwise lacking skill in Virginia school systems. On the other hand, having the projects be teacher made would make them more easy to asses. The summer projects should be student designed because, it allows the student to pursue their own interest, also it makes the student be creative; adversely, having them be teacher made would allow for the teacher to much easier asses the student.

First of all, having student made summer projects would help the students find what interest them. This is an important step in piecing together your future. Me personally, a junior in high school, has no idea what field of work best interests me. Exposing these young minds to as many topics as possible could significantly help them choose an occupation to peruse. Having them create their own projects would help them deeper explore,or understand their interests. Therefore, student created projects would help spark interest.

Also, giving them the freedom to design their project would force them to be creative. School seems to suck all the creativity right out of its students. From the never ending notes to the standards set by the state. There seems to be no room for creativity, or individualism. It always seems to be bland and without color.

We as a community forget that not everyone is a textbook kind of learner. There is a lot that factors into the psychology of learning and many forget that. Having projects more open ended and student designed would shed some of this pressure, and allow for the students to be creative and do their best work. Also creativity is extremely important. The earth is a never ending cycle of creation. Who will be the next Steve Jobs or maybe carry out an even bigger legacy. creativity sparks change, it makes us advance as the human race. In conclusion, giving the students the task of designing their summer projects will let them be creative.

Lastly, letting the students design their projects would make it harder for the teacher to asses the student. This is important to the teacher. The teacher needs to know who needs help and with what. They need to help make sure you are prepared for the real world. A good teacher is truly a miracle worker. They need some way of assessing students. But this is not the way. The students should have many more options in the way they learn, but that is what tests are for. Therefore, it is important to be able to asses their students, but designing their projects is going about it all wrong.

To conclude, summer projects should be student designed, rather than teacher designed. It will help the student figure out their interest better. It could even interest them to learn at all. And it lets the students be creative and let their minds free from the joke that is our school system. It shows how being yourself and being creative can positively impact you, and could even spark new interests. Therefore, Students should design their own summer projects to show them their interests and to also allow them to be creative and learn in a way that appeals to them. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
A538E8B618FA,"If a school was to require a summer break they should allow the students to create their summer projects because it will be more creative, teachers just make useless busy work and the students are more likely to personally learn from the experience.

Students being involved in their summer project will allow students to get creative and think for themselves. Summer projects get students in a negative state of mind because they would prefer to enjoy their break and hang out with friends. If they are given the creativity to make their own summer project they might collaborate with friends and make a really cool project with all the free time they have. If students were given their own opportunities to make fun projects with friends over the break they will create more interactive, and impressive work.

If a teacher was to make an assignment over the break it would be super boring and most likely just busy work. If it were a math assignment it would just be a packet or some problems to get you back into the unit before summer starts. English teachers often just make kids read books that are super boring and lack their interest over the summer. Teachers tend to make work over the break pointless and when the students do work over the break it makes them hate the class before they've even started it. It also adds an extra level of stress when summer is supposed to be free time. Some kids come back to school and have a forty-five page packet due in math class by the first week of school. Teachers overall make school harder than it has to be by assigning pointless busy work over summer break.

One way this could have a bad turnout if kids made their own projects due to the fact that they won't want design a creative and fun project. Some if not most kids will see that they have to make an assignment over the break, they'll buy a poster board, they'll copy and paste a few articles about a boring topic and glue them to the poster board. They won't put any effort into a summer project because they don't want to do work over their break. They find a project over the break to be very counter intuitive because they've just done work for nine months straight and do not want to keep doing work. Kids do not want to do a project over the break in the first place and if they see that it is easy and has no positive effect on their schooling they'll make it quick and easy and never worry about the project again.

The final way a student made project will have a better outcome is they'll actually personally learn from the experience. If a student is given their own choice about a summer project in englsh class. They're more likely to pick a book of their interest and actually finish the book instead of just skim reading it, looking up a summary or even watching the movie if that is an option. If the student picks their own book of interest they'll read the whole thing, gain important information about the book and be ready to discuss it once school starts again. If the students have summer project in history and really like World War II but the teacher assigns them the Civil Rights movement they're more likely to not do the project. If they're allowed to pick their own topic and write a report about World War II like they're personally interested in they're gonna do the project and do it right. They'll gain from this personal experience and have a good time while doing it.

Students' learning should not be done through busy work or packets with fifty pages. It should be done through personal interest and personal involvment. When a student learns a packet is the most boring and pointless thing a student can receive. Given their own choice on summer projects students are more likely to get involved, genuinely learn from the experience and not be handed premade expected projects where they have to follow a boring rubric to the tea and lack creativity.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
197CEA0EF269,"It is the last day of school, the only thing on your mind is your exciting vacation and the warm weather, the only time that you are free from teachers telling you to what to do and when to do it. When all of a sudden your teacher says that you have a long and tedious project that is due at the end of summer. As a response to this, I argue that students should be the ones designing these projects, in order to increase specific skills, bolster creativity, and gain experience designing the project.

Throughout the school year, projects that are assigned by teachers don't capture student's true capabilities and skills. However, if students designed their own projects, they could finally display their strengths, which would lead to an increase in motivation for perfecting the project. Furthermore, students have responsibilities and activities during the summer that may cause a low quality project to emerge if they don't have much motivation. For example, students who compete in the school science fair do very well because designing your own project increases motivation for yielding a higher quality project.

I once heard, ""necessity is the mother of invention."" This quote is indicating that when their is high demand for something, or if someone is wondering how or why something works, new inventions and innovations are made. When considering projects, the same rule applies; questioning what you are interested in yields innovation that have built this country since day one. For example, Bill Gates wouldn't have founded Microsoft is he didn't research and look into what he was interested in. This proves that when students create their own projects based on questioning and logic, their is a greater chance for success.

During the school year, everything is designed by teachers: tests, projects and homework. In response to this, I raise an important question, how do you expect us to be the next generation of well rounded and intelligent people, when we have been told what to do and when to do it since day one? The only way to give students this freedom of choosing how to design the project without disrupting normal school schedule, is to assign it in the summer. Not only does this bolster self thinking and creativity, but also it utilizes the summer months, a long period of time, to think about and develop this project.

In response to the question of giving students the right to design their own projects, I argue that in order to increase specific skills, bolster creativity, and gain experience, the best choice is to give students this ability to design their own projects. In general, these skills will help students prepare for adult life, where they will need the specific skills that are full filed through this project.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
CFC8DF0444C4,"Is giving students homework during their Summer Break a good thing? Does it allow them to retian information and hopefully use it for next year? But even better, should these students be even given the privelage of assigning their own homework? No,Its up to the teachers to give teacher-designed projects for the students because they know what to teach us ,how to teach us,and ultimately whats best for us,students can't be trusted to assign their own project,and teachers know what things we have to know for next year.

Teachers are people we go to when we need to learn things. They give us the answers we're seeking for. When assigning projects,they don't just make it easy for you. They make it a challenge ,not just because they want to or because we think they don't like us. It's because they know what's best for us. They know what's best for us in a way that a parent knows what's best for their children. When I was younger my mom always made sure I hung out with the right group of people. She said ""son ,when you're older you'll understand one day when you have kids of your own.""Now I wasn't really fond of this ,but it ended up helping me out in the future when she told me to stop hanging out with this group of certain people who always used to mess around in class and they got caught throwing fart bombs in class and the whole group got in trouble. I'm getting a little off track here, but the point im trying to make here is ,teachers know what's best for us. They know how to teach,what to teach,the best way to teach us ,and what is best to teach us.

Its not every day that the teachers give us a chance to assign our own projects. This would be a once in a lifetime opportunity that the teachers are giving us. The ability to choose our own project. WOW! I wish we were mature enough to handle that responsability. But,the truth is we would make it as easy as possible. You may be thinking heck yea that sounds perfectly fine to me. But,in doing that you would defeat the whole point of doing the Summer project in the first place. Let's think,what""s the whole point of doing this project. Is it because we have all that freetime during break that they want us doing something productive? Or because we have nothing better to do? Its to help prepare us for next year and what we might learn. I have to admit ,I forget pretty much everything I learn last year. Which is super bad because when I get into the next school year that information from last year that i forgot could be needed in the class for next year. Which it is why it's important that we make it a challenge and acyually know what we need to study. So that we can retain more information. That is why kids can't be trusted to assign their own project.

The last and final reason why teachers should assigning our summer project is because they know what we need to learn for next year. Going into the new school year is really hard when we have to come in and learn things we've never seen before in our life. But, with teahcers assigning our projects,we could maybe get an idea of what we're learning. That would be extraordinarely helpful to kids who have a hard time learning because with projects being assigned to us ,we could finally study over break with information we'll be using next year. Giving us better grades ,and dont we all just love good grades. They boost our confidence up .And showing your parents your all ""A"" report card can be lifechanging. Ultimately this is why teachers should assign our projects over Summer Break.

In teachers assigning our Summer Break projects ,we have a better opportunity at passing the coarses in the following school year,We have something to do over break,and it gives us extra brain work and hepls us grow our school brains. Allowing us to be succeseful and setting us up for greatness in the upcoming school year. Teachers know what we should study and how we should study in order to retain the information needed to be learned and revised.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
84C6F616721B,"I think that the projects should be student-designed because when they choose a project they would already know what to do, they wouldn't make it hard, and they can do it on their own time.

I think when the kids get to chose there own projects they would have to think about what their going to do. Some kids would already know what they want to do and go ahead and start it. Some of them will have to think for a little bit to figure out what their going to do. Some of the kids would probably not even do it at all because their to lazy. Most of the kids would probably finish it early so they wont have to worry about it later.

When kids do projects that the teachers gives them most of the time their hard to do and hard to understand. So when the kids get to choose they wont make it that hard and they would make it to where they can understand it. They would make it to where they can actually do it and get it done before the due date. If the kids get to choose what they want to do for the project then they probably would want to do it. The kids could finish the project if they already know what their going to do for it.

If the kids choose what to do for the project then they would be able to do it whenever they have time as long as its before the due date. If the kids are busy then they wont be able to do the project until they get done doing what their doing. As long as they do the project before the due date then they will fine and they wont get in trouble. If they get to do it whenever they want to they will be able to go out and do what they want before they have to finish and turn the project in. Most kids will probably forget that they have to do a project and have to do it at the last minute and it wont be as good.

In conlusion, I think that the students should choose what they want to do for the projects instead of having the teachers choose because if the students pick they would already know what to do and go ahead and start it, they wouldnt make it hard, and they can also do it on their own time. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
8EF7C2316736,"Summer is like a brainwash. Students seem to forget everything they learned in school that year over the summer. To try and combat this, many teachers assign summer projects so the students don't fall behind on any of their learning. Students are often upset by this, wanting their summer to be fun and stress free. Teacher designed projects are often long and tedious making them boring to do. The summer projects should be student-designed. Having the projects be student-designed allows for a greater range of creativity, more control over how the project is completed, and creates a better mindset for disgruntled students.

Allowing for summer projects to be student designed makes for a greater range of creativity. A greater range of creativity would encite students to finish their projects faster if they were given a wider range of mediums to work with instead of just paper and pencil, or a computer program. Even when it's not over the summer, being assigned a project where I can make a poster or create a diorama instead of writing a paper is already much more exciting to me because I'm given a bunch of different mediums to work with. I personally prefer creating something big and artsy to sitting down and churning out a paper within a set time frame. The process of creating something huge feel much more satisfying because I can visibly see when I am done. Completing a paper still has a feeling of satisfaction but the overall feeling is dulled because no creativity was released. A greater range of creativity also allows for a much more interesting presentation. A differentation of styles in projects makes the overall project much more interesting and increases the chances of students paying attention for longer during those presentations.

Completion of the project is thought to be most important. Allowing students to control how the project is completed is much more student oriented. A student oriented project should be more fun and less stressful as to not add anything more on top of an already heavy workload. Letting students decide how the project is presented and what the rubric should entail makes the students not only happier, but less stressed as a result. If the students can control what they want to do in the project or how the final product should be, it could help immensely with the overall students happiness and create a stronger student community.

The mindset for summer is just fun, fun, fun. Adding a summer project dampens that mindset. It becomes a burden for students to deal with. No one wants to do schoolwork over the summer, summer is the time for fun! Allowing students to create a student designed project would create an overall better mindset towards how summer project are viewed. I know that I don't want to do school work over the summer. Giant math packets, books to read, papers to write, it's all so tedious and I always end up pushing it off til August, where I'm then rushing to get it all done in time for the start of school. If I were to be given a project that I could control, it would already seem so much better because I would be in full control over what I did for the project or how I approached a problem I encountered with it. It's important to keep a healthy mindset in school so you don't burn yourself out. Summer is seen as a time to destress and have fun and creating a better mindset towards student project by making them student designed is extremely crucial to that.

When I think of school projects, I think of teachers handing them out at the end of a quarter or towards the end of school to be completed over the summer. Projects are a way to either boost or bring down your grade, depending on how you do. Because of that effect on grades, important projects tend to stress students out. When students are given more control over a project it immediately takes stress off the student because they automatically control how their project is made and presented. Teacher designed projects are made to showcase how well teachers teach their students. If more students get a higher grade on a project, the credibility of that teacher goes up. They are viewed as a better teacher overall. While teacher designed projects might have more academic results, having projects be student-designed creates a wider range of creativity, control over how the project is executed, and makes a more postive mindset for students.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
AAFA0B9080C0,"Students take their summer break to relax and have fun, but others will have a few projects to complete before school starts again. Many schools in the country will require students to complete summer projects, they want to ensure that students are still learning over break. I believe that these summer projects should be student designed because it allows them to be creative, they can pick topics they are interested in, and do the project how they would like.

Having students design their projects will allow them to be creative, many students would not enjoy the project as much if the teacher has a set design on how the project will be. Students would not be eager to do it and delay the assignment waiting till last minute to start it; allowing them to have full creative ability will produce incredible work. Students can express artistic ability with their work allowing them to draw pictures, use different mediums, lavish colors, and think of creative designs. Just giving them that freedom could make the assignment exciting instead of feeling like a chore they are forced to do.

Students can pick topics they are interested in allowing them to enjoy the project. If the teacher assigns a topic students are not interested in, it would not be an enjoyable time. The students would not be motivated to do research on the topic, they would push off on the assignment, and be completely unaware of important facts in their topic. By allowing them to chose any topic it would make learning fun, a student can be fascinated by a topic but never had the opportunity to thoroughly research it and this would be the chance. The research they would do may mean a lot to them, it could be a future occupation they want to be helping them learn the requirements needed for specific facilities, schools, and how much money they would make. It could also allow for students to be informed on a topic they do not know much about and would like to be knowledgeable in a certain field. Having students chose would be an incredible opportunity to learn.

Lastly, students are able to do the projects how they would like to do it. Having the teacher decide how the project will be set up may be underwhelming for students or difficult to set up. By allowing them to chose how to do their project will result in creative ideas and make the project less difficult. Some students may want to do something else than a regular PowerPoint, they could make a book filled with all the information needed and they can draw pictures. Maybe they want to do videography, they could film a music video or a short film with a script and actors. Also by allowing them to chose it could create less pressure for the students, there are many sites that have layouts and videos guiding them with their project. If they are not able to do it how the teacher wants it they cannot ask them for help they are over break and could not have the teacher's contact information.

The summer projects are a great way to assure students are still learning over break but allowing the students to design their projects would be an incredible opportunity for them to be creative, pick topics they are interested in, and do the project how they would like. I believe this would be a good opportunity for schools and students to keep learning even over their break and encourage them to always be knowledgeable                                      ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
05C28F111573,"Summer is the best time of the year and when the final bell of the school year sounds everyone jumps for joy for the three month long break. Summer gives students a break from nine months of hard work, tests, projects, and homework. However, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during break. Summer projects should not have to be a punishment or torture; therefore, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to pick a topic they want to learn about, it makes it that students are more interested and driven to do research and learn new information, and it also enhances students to show their creativeness.

Student-designed projects allow for a student to choose any topic they want. If I had to do a summer project I would want to pick my own topic to learn about. I once had a summer assignment where the teacher gave us all the information and said to turn it in on the first day. The topic was not only boring, but it didnt make me learn because I ended up dropping out of the class due to the lack of interest in the subject. Students should be able to design a project based on a topic they want because it creates a better working environment when you do something you want to do versus being given something you dont want to do and told to do it. In result, all projects should be self chosen and not teacher chosen because of the drive to learn about something that entices an individual.

Student-designed projects would increase the interest level of learning and result in more passion and drive to learn. Not only would students learn more, they would get better grades on these projects because they would be more passionate about it due to being interested in the subject. I play baseball, and I know for a fact that if someone said to complete a project on any sport you want to I would be more excited than if someone gave me a sport like soccer that I wasnt interested in. This would promote better research, resulting in better grades and a higher level of learning. Being interested and passionate about a topic would also enhance one's creativity o a project.

Being creative on a project is a big part of most rubrics and in order to get a good grade one most show some sort of creativeness. Student-designed projects allow for the most amount of creativeness because you have free reign on what you want to do. Designs given by the teacher are structured and don't fully allow for the creator to show his or her way of expressing a topic through creative things like color, picture, words, etc. Student chosen projects provide a one-hundred percent option for anything you want to include.

Although teacher-designed summer projects provide a structured layout and a related topic the class, they dont allow for students to be interested and driven in a subject of their choice and to have the ability to put anything they want to in their project. Summer is a time of rest and teacher-designed projects cause stress and anxiety; however, student-designed projects allow for a student to be calm knowing that they are doing something they want to do and not doing something they have to do. Student-designed projects benefits and enables students to open learning during the best three months of the year.       ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
4B097196C25B,"School just got out and the students finally have time to relax. They realize there is school later in the year, but forget about that, it's summer. In order to keep the students mentally sharp for the upcoming school year, they are given medial and mundane tasks over the summer to make sure they can continue to perform at the top of their game. Students often complain about how boring the assignment is, and they have a point;the summer assignments are often way too specific or require an immense amount of creativity to put together coherently. The task of summer projects is to continue learning even when school is out and thus the job to design the summer assignment should be in the hands of the teachers.

Although students would perform better if the summer assignment topic was something a little more relevant, the point is to learn and maintain a standard. If students could teach themselves, then there would be no purpose of going to school. A trend currently is the degradation of students and their worsening grades. If those same students were given the choice to either write a teacher's prompt or their own prompt, all of them would write a terrible paper. There would be no incentive to trying as the student can write about a topic that is nonsense and get away with it. Teachers direct and guide students to learning new things, and they set the standard for the years to come.

Students are fed up with school at the end of year, and now they have the free time to do anything they so wish. Their brains are not in the growing mindset;instead, they are thinking about the next parties or road trips. A student designing an assignment in their head might sound good to them, but in reality, it tends to turn out very poorly structured or lazily written. Students cannot be held accountable to remember every single detail of a particular class to be able to design an assignment especially in the midst of their summer fun.

The last reason that teachers should design summer assignments is grading them. They understand what the assignment should roughly be about. They know the differences of a terrible, average, or great paper. It would be impossible to fairly grade students if they all submit completely random and baseless papers that are not comparable to each other. The teacher should assign something that allows all the paper to have a consistent threat throughout the paper. Having all the students connected to a single topic helps prevent students from going off the rails on their assignment later on.

Overall, those that can teach in school should be able to design something to teach outside of school. Education is not about the satisfaction the student can derive from it, but the brutal reality of how well they can understand. With more students failing, it is the teacher's job to raise the bar and help those students work to get there. Lowering the bar creates a positive feed cycle;students will become worse and worse as the amount of effort required plummets. Teachers should design the assignments that best suit their students strengths.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
8C1072D440D7,"Summer assignments are one of the aspects of summer break that students dread the most. It can make your Summer go from one hundred to zero really quickly, especially if it's late August and you just remembered it. Students dread it because it's so tedious and time consuming that it's less of a learning experience and more of a back breaking chore. Although, if they were made by students it would be a different story. Summer assignments should be assigned and designed by students and for students because otherwise they can be jarring and time consuming. Also if students were to make them, then it could touch more students on a personal level and have more creativity.

Summer assignments can feel repetitive and boring when some teachers assign it, especially reading assignments. It often boils down to the same formula: Read or research a book or topic, write an essay, make a connection, and sometimes something interesting is thrown in if you're lucky. Students most likely dislike doing it because it gives them nothing but a dry and lifeless ""challenge"", headaches, and wasted time for a grade. Also, a lot of teachers mistake challenge for difficulty when they are two vastly different things. Something can be challenging and easy, which is what summer assignments should be. They aren't hard or challenging in any way, it's just annoying. Additionally, the books are often chosen for you instead of finding one yourself, and even that's a gamble because you don't know if you'll like the book or not. Which makes the connection part harder because you may not connect with a single character in the book.

Students understand the pain and strife of other students, be it hard work, strict teachers, tight deadlines, or all of the above. What they also have a better understanding in, is that students don't want to spend a month, sometimes two, of their break doing research on a topic they don't care that much about. As well as they don't want to read a book in it's entirety that they didn't choose. So naturally they'll bring far more practical and interactive ideas to the table. Such as having them read from a genre of their choosing, or maybe having them analyze a movie or poem, or just having them do a project on an issue that affects them. It'll keep the same purpose of the summer assignment, keeping you working and educated while you're out of school, while making the whole experience less painful and tedious to go through.

Something that people might think when it comes to students making the assignments is they might make it too simple, thus making it ineffective. As well as the point of the boring books is to help students widen their vocabulary or show them . But, there are many ways to better someone's vocabulary than to thrust a four hundred plus page book onto them. Such as using a shorter book, maybe let them broaden it on their own fruition etc. Also, it is possible that there may be someone trying to help the others get out of jail free by giving them a low effort assignment. But, an easy way to fix that is to have a group of students rather than just one or a couple, then they could all vote and see which idea would benefit the most people. Furthermore, an easy assignment that students will enjoy and have fun with as they work is far better than a ""hard"" assignment that no one will enjoy.

There's nothing wrong with the idea of summer assignments on paper, but in practice it falls way short. But students can provide other students with a fun and truly challenging way without the hassle of bogus material. Naturally, this seems like a far fetched idea, having students assign any kind of assignments, but it might not be so bad if we just give it a try. Who knows, maybe the students will feel more inclined to do their work if they weren't getting the same thing every year.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
876BE44293AE,"Who wants to do a new project made by somebody else thats confusing during your only break? Students lose their free time trying to figure out what to do and how to complete the work the teachers give to them, and we can't ask for help and get it like we would in school so most students struggle on trying to complete it the way the teachers want it done. I believe the students should come up with the project design because we can complete it faster, the work would be better to the teachers to look at cause it'll be different ideas from each student.

Since they can complete the work their way it can give them more time to themselves, family, and friends instead of trying to think on how to finish the work. They can struggle on the same part since they out with family and constantly doing something and not giving them time to complete it. Since teachers usually be so strict on how to get the work done then it can cause stress on the students and could mess up their whole break trying to finish it or just make them not even want to do any of it. But the better the student can make the project for themselves the more work they can get done faster than a whole different design.

Another thing is on how it can be better work cause of the different ideas. Plenty of families go on vacation to different places with their kids or go to different places doing fun things, and since that could take up most of the time they can just do it based on what they have done that break. Some teachers want to hear about what their students did during that summer, and the different ideas from the students can make the teacher have something entertaining to read or see other than looking at the same thing over and over at the beginning of the year. The way the students think too can change how good the project turn out to be and can be something fun for the students to work on too and can change how their school year begin.

If they schools allow students to design their own projects it can really turn out better on everybody and give them more time to enjoy their break and even though we could come up with it we can still learn new things while working on it, planning on how to work on it, or after completing it. But this is why I think we should have student designed projects.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
9A79069BB83A,"When I was in 9th and 10th grade, I had to do summer projects all the time. Even though I didn't want to do them, they helped me for the next year so my brain stayed fresh. However, doing it under the teachers rule felt like working in a factory, and it also felt like we weren't learning as much as we were just doing the project. I think that summer projects should be student designed because, it helps with the student's creativity level, puts less stress on the teachers, and allows the student to learn the best way possible.

When you learn, it's best to learn in a way that is fun and enjoyable to do. Student designed summer projects would help the student's creativity level. My friend Generic_Name and I were able to design our own projects in middle school and got A's all the time, because we made our projects different each time we did them. Creativity level is also key when you have to do projects for work when you get older. If you want to stand out from all the other projects people are doing, the only to get creative with your product.

Another reason students should design their own projects is because it could put less stress on the teachers who assigned it. With all the work the kids are doing, and since some teachers are putting in more time to grade and organize summer assignments, they'll be able to let the students work and all they ave to do is grade the work. I always talk to my teachers on a personal level, and a lot of them say that making/coming up with projects are one of the hardest things to do as a teacher when you have other things on your plate. So students making their own projects would help with that stress which means that they can put more time into grading your project precisely.

Lastly, another way student designed projects are a better choice than teacher designed projects is because they allow the student to learn the best way possible. I always thought personalized learning was helpful. It let students be their own teacher and learn how to find information about a topic efficiently, and students learn better if they are forced to find the answer themselves. So if we make our own projects, we can choose how to learn the material in the best way, shape, or form.

So summer projects should definitely be designed by students to expand their creativity, let teachers grade with time and no stress, and better their learning experience. Not only will students have a great grade on their summer project, but these skills that they are learning and using now will be very useful in college and in the work force when they're older.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
7BC672095230,"For many students, summer is a time to relax their minds after their strenuous school year of homework, projects, and exams. However, many schools implement summer projects to keep young students' minds sharp. Whether summer reading, research projects, or vocabulary, schools highly encourage their teachers to implement summer projects onto their students. When constructed by the teacher, summer projects allow students to reach their full potential due to is close relationship to the curriculum, the academic foundation it provides for the upcoming school year, and the equal amount of work for all students.

Firstly, teacher-designed projects are designed by those actually teaching the subject. When teachers create the summer projects for their students, those students in return are given a preview of what they will be learning during the school year. Commonly, students enter a course unsure of what exactly they will be learning. They might expect for their year to focus on one subject whereas the curriculum may only briefly cover it. When students receive teacher-designed projects, the students are familiarized with what to expect out of their course. For instance, history teachers may assign a research project of a specific time period. With specificity provided by the teachers, students gain clarity on what they will be taught in their new classes. Aside from showing students what they will be learning, teacher-designed projects also teach the students.

Because schools encourage teachers to implement summer assignments to better prepare students for the upcoming school year, these projects serve to ease students into their courses. For instance, prior to my junior year of high school I received a teacher-designed project in my AP Biology course. With junior year being my first year of AP courses, I was unfamiliar with what the class would entail. Fortunately however, the project designed by my teacher provided me a basis of what I would begin to learn in Fall and the depth of what my understanding would need to be. Although a long project, I learned vocabulary terms and studied biological processes which became useful throughout the school year in the class. Through completion of the project, although inexperienced with such high level classes, I entered the school year confident and ready for my college leveled assignments. With my understanding of the content I would be learning, I also earned time-management skills as I knew how much effort would be needed for the class. Despite as a student I found the summer assignment to be tedious, those teacher-designed projects fully prepared me for my intensive class load for my junior year of high school.

Although some may argue for the student-designed projects, unfortunately certain students may take advantage of its given flexibility. With increase popularity of sports, jobs, and extracurricular activities, among high school students, certain students may not put in all of their effort for projects they create for oneself. Where students with a full schedule may complete the project at the bare minimum, other students may design long, elaborate projects. When students are assigned teacher-designed projects, students work at the same level. By taking in account both ends of the spectrum, teachers design projects at a middle ground to create assignments with a proper, realistic amount of work doable for all of their students.

With schools having the goal to assure continued learned during the course of academic breaks, teacher-designed projects are ideal in achieving this goal. By teachers developing projects for their students to complete over break, students gain confidence in the upcoming school year. Through these projects, teachers help students develop skills necessary for their classes. Despite the implication of impeding on students' summer vacation, schools mandating teacher-design projects assure students are well prepared for their return in September.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
3AFEB01D9E38,"The mentioning of school projects over the summer may cause a few children to complain, but some schools require students to complete them. There are many different types of assignments that can be given, the large decision of who determines the projects must be made first. Students and teachers may both be able to create a summer project, but teachers are the better option. Teachers should design summer projects because they can provide better content, grading is simpler, and they are more prepared to give such assignments.

Summer projects designed by teachers would be better for learning specific school-related content. Teachers who know the curriculum for their class can give projects over the summer that prepare students for the following school year. Student-designed projects would be less representative of actual class material and therefore be less beneficial for learning. For example, students will have a much harder time planning a trigonometry project over the summer than their future teacher for the class would, because they are not yet familiar with the subject; instead, the trigonometry teacher can provide one using their knowledge. Although new teachers may not be strong in the subject they plan to teach, projects could be created jointly among teachers in the same field. An assignment could even take advantage of collaboration among many teachers to create an assignment that reflects multiple subjects.

Teachers should create summer projects because it would be simpler for grading purposes. It will be easier for teachers to grade projects they assign, because they created the content and know what to expect. Likewise, if students were to create their own projects over the summer, teachers may not be fully prepared to score what they are given. Children will likely find more problems with the grade they receive if they are given the freedom to design their own projects, because the requirements of the project could be debated. It is redundant for teachers to ask their students what they plan to complete over the summer and deal with all of them. If teachers were to create the project, there will be less confusion and the children can instead question the teachers to clarify concerns. Even if there is a rubric all students must follow for the assignment they create, it would be simpler for the teachers to design the whole project themselves.

Teachers are better prepared to create a project over the summer when compared to students. A summer assignment will most likely be large and have many requirements. Teachers are tasked with assigning multiple projects every school year, so they are more able to make a better project. One of the desires of having a student-designed project may be to give students the possibility to use their own interests. However, not all students have the necessary skills to create their own project that also fulfills school requirements, and so this could just cause unneeded stress for some children. The school year itself will almost always consist of teachers giving an assignment, and students completing them. A teacher-designed project given over the summer will be better for everyone involved because of this.

There are pros and cons to teachers determining the makeup of summer projects, but the positives greatly outnumber the negatives. The job requirement of a teacher is to provide students with the ability to learn, and to create a summer project themselves helps achieve that. All students do not possess the skills teachers have to give relevant content for a certain class or subject. The task of giving a summer project for students to complete should be given to teachers.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
A7F6D05B5D22,"Do you remember your last summer project? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. Summer projects should be teacher designed because they can choose challenging topics, make the project teach new material, and can grade the projects on their own rubric.

Student designed projects could be great since they can make how difficult it is for them, but this is not a good idea. A teacher designed summer project is the way to go because the teachers can choose how challenging the projects are for their students. For example, students would try to make their projects very easy for them to complete so that they could do less work, but this would not allow them to learn very much. Teachers would make sure that the topic encourages the student to push themselves and use what they have learned through out the school year to complete it. This way the students would not forget the material they have learned the past year and go into the next school year fresh and ready to go.

Secondly, Teacher designed summer projects would be better because they can make the project teach new material. For instance, a math project could show the students how to use a new formula that will be needed for their next grade. In addition to using topics that they already know so that they won't be forgotten, the project could incorporate a new concept. In doing so, students could learn and use these new topics to help them smoothly transition into the new year.

Finally, the last reason why summer projects should be teacher designed is because they can grade them on their own rubric. For example, if students create their own summer projects then it would be a bit more complicated to grade their projects. if the teacher creates the project, then they can make sure that it meets certain criteria that would be needed.

In conlusion, Teacher designed summer projects would be far better than student designed summer projects because they can choose challenging topics, make the project teach new material, and can grade the projects on their own rubric. To whom it may concern, I strongly suggest that summer projects be, and stay, teacher designed. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
8799ED61A608,"It should come as no surprise that the secret to scholarly success is to stay one step ahead of the competition. Recognizing this, many schools have opted to assign summer course work to ensure their students start the next year strong. However, they often face the dilemma over whether these assignments should be designed by teachers or by the students themselves. Despite the possibility of kids slacking off, student-driven summer work will prepare students for a future in their chosen field and ease the stressful workloads of both teachers and students alike.

The stress of a high school environment is all but increasing, and has been for decades. This trend has been documented extensively over the years, and all these studies sum up to high-schoolers, on average, being exhausted, overworked and overall unhappy on a daily basis. Teachers are not spared either, as they face the same struggles their students deal with day in and day out, often for no more than a substandard salary to say the least. Therefore, it makes sense for schools to do anything in their means to ease the burdens of a rigorous academic climate. One of the best ways to go about this would be to allot responsibilities of designing summer work from teachers to their students.

Another advantage of this proposition is that students will be able to take control of their own educational futures. The thought and effort they put into their summer work will directly manifest itself in their scores. Those who perform poorly will score poorly, whereas those who take it seriously will reap the rewards. This is the best way for teachers to measure the academic integrity of a class, allowing them to hone in on students who need assistance the most over the coming school year. As an added benefit, students will be pushed to learn other essential skills such as time management and independence which will certainly come into play later on in their lives.

Perhaps most important of all, students will have the opportunity to pursue an area of study of their choice. An individualized approach tailored for and by each student on their own is sure to make learning a more enjoyable and productive experience. In contrast, a standardized assignment designed to fulfill the needs and wants of each unique individual in a class at once amounts to nothing but stress, frustration and apathy towards what could have been an indispensable tool for students' future careers.

The advantages of a student-driven summer project far outweigh the potential pitfalls of such a program.

Those who would be inclined to laze their way out of assignments will find ways to avoid doing work no matter what, so why impede the success of the majority due to the inevitable actions of the few? Hopefully soon enough academic institutions will come to their senses and adopt such policies which provide unlimited benefit to all involved.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
8DA0B80420FC,"some schools believe that students should be given projects over the summer to assure they learn, should theses projects be teacher or student designed? although teachers can make sure students doing what they need; I personally believe that it should be student because students can make it more a peeling to one another, it helps builds creative students, and shows your city you are getting your youth involved.

First, student can make it a peeling for one and another, many will only do it if the works grabs their attention. The more students what to do the project the mare effort or thought will be put in to it. who better to make a project to keep students attention the the students themselves. Because while students are on break many do not have people to push them and make sure they are doing their work so it has to be a project that they would want to do on their own. and if a blunder is made the student can't say they didn't understand because the students designed the projects. This will be a way to grab the attention of whoever grades the project, like a hook in a essay.

Next, it will help build creative students, just as school is supposed to do for students. Yes schools are a place of learning, but while students are in school they are building creative thoughts that are just waiting to be used. giving the students the chance to design their summer summer project helps give the schools notice of what future creator you are putting into the world. If the students are creating their own summer project it teaches then about Independence, and that they don't need a teacher standing over top of them to do their work. With student designing their own project it will make great business skills.

Last, It shows the city you are getting the students involved. After all the students in our school system now are our future town council, school bored leaders, and teachers. so I'm sure the school bored would be pleased to hear that while students are going on their summer break they are not only doing but designing their summer project. Students after the summer can come to tell the public about there how designing their own project helps them in independence and self learning. Although many students may not care for it it will help them keep what they learn and learn new thing researching and designing their summer project.

To sum it all up, although although teachers can make sure students are doing what they need; I personally believe that it should be student designing the summer project. And students can make it more a peeling to one another, it helps builds creative students, and shows your city you are getting your youth involved are just three of many reason.

1360BDCC0176,"Teacher-designed or Student-designed Summer Assignments?

Summer assignments are imperative for keeping students learning over their break, as well as keeping them active in their creativity. All classes should have some form of summer assignment. With that being said, some people may prefer to be given specific guidelines to follow, others may prefer to take matters into their own hands. Everyone has different learning habits and some are better than others. These assignments should be student- designed because you are more motivated and perform better when given space for creativity, there will be less procrastination, and theres more room for retaining information.

Motivation can take a student a long way. Doing well on summer assignments is important so, it's also important to give students opportunities to be creative in their own way.

Designing the project themselves gives them that drive to make a good project and present it to their teach with pride. Nothing is better than being inspired and excited to show your teacher what you've been working so hard on over the summer when school starts again in the fall. Students know whats best for them and will have a better project thats more personalized and expresses their thought process of said topic if they design their project. Teachers oftentimes struggle coming up with interactive projects that will get their students thinking. Giving them the freedom to create their own type of project is better than having students struggle to come up with ideas.

Summer time is about having fun, but also preparing for the next school year and thats why we have summer projects. Many students dread summer assignments but they shouldn't have to. School assignments shouldn't be stressful, but many of them are. This is why many students procrastinate with their summer assignments because they have no interest in the work. Students tend to procrastinate for long periods of time, until the last few weeks of summer, or even the last few days before returning to school in the fall. From one perspective, if a student can do the project the way they prefer, they are likely not to put the project to the side. Giving students all the tools they need not to procrastinate is key to a well designed, well thought out project.

Most students are just looking to get a passing grade for the work they did in the summer, however, actually learning from the project is important too. Designing their own project ensures they will learn a couple of things in the process. In my experience, I am more likely to learn something new and connect it to other things if I have a hand in the process of making it. This makes it more interesting for me and, in result, I get excited to learn new things. When teachers design assignments in general it may feel a little forced upon students and they simply won't learn as much in comparison to if they were to be apart of the creative process. The whole point of these projects is for students to learn something new or review something they learned the past school year so it's important these projects are designed in the students favor.

Some may argue that teachers can design a better assignment than students because they know whats best; However, students are more motivated when given the space to be creative, being passionate from that motivation will decrease procrastination, and students will actually learn something if they design projects the way they like. Students are the future of the world and deserve the right education tools to succeed. All in all, students should have more say now a days in their assignments and more teachers should promote creative freedom in their classrooms to further motivate students.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
EF4951AAD772,"Having a project assigned to you during summer is nothing but dreadful however, engaging in a topic you are interested in feels less like a project and more like a learning journey. Being able to select your own project will ensure you are engaged in what you are learning, prompting creativity! When students are presented with a project that allows them to be creative they are then truly enabled to produce great work. A teacher will not be at the tip of a students finger in summer in order to resolve any questions about an assignment given, but when the project is chosen by the student many of these questions are only resolvable on their own terms. Summer is not a time students want to be engulfed by yet another project given by their teacher, but having a productive outlet for students to be creative will bring about great results.

Being assigned a topic you are not interested in brings about dread, a sense of wasted time, and many other negative emotions; which will likely only produce work lacking its full potential. When a student is given the choice to produce work that interest them the students true potential is often seen. Choosing a topic independently makes your work more interesting, knowing you are the only person working on it. Having a teacher assign you a project feels more like just another paper to you and the teacher than your work does knowing you are producing creative, meaningful, and worth-while work. Feeling that reassurance that you are creating unique work makes a project feel more like an enrichment to your education rather than just another dreadful assignment.

Many people are held back from expressing their full creativity because they simply are not interested in the project they are given in such a way for it to resonate with them on a creative level. However, having students select their own project eliminates that problem. Working on something that you have no interest in verses something that you want to put your effort and time into creates two completely different results. Spending your energy on something you actually want to work on is bound to have much more pleasing results than something you are not very interested in. Having this option also gets rid of any doubt you are potential doing your assignment incorrectly.

The point of a summer project is to keep your mind engaged while you are out of the classroom setting. However, you may still need help and have questions about your assignment in summer where you do not have readily access to someone who can answer your questions. Being assigned a specific project is bound to bring about stress on whether or not you are doing it correctly. With a project that allows you to choose and be more creative with your assignment you have the ability to shape your ideas around how you think they should be done and not have the stress of a projects guidelines and curriculum.

Some may say students are bound to select a topic that they can easily brush off without much thought but, many students seek for somewhere to unleash their creativity and have it seen in a positive productive way. Having a student-designed project is a great opportunity for many learners and educators to bring their own lives and preferences into learning. Projects should be based more upon personal learning and preference rather than curriculum and rubrics. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
5CD0A11E317E,"Why should the creativity of students be suppressed when they have to complete an assignment or project? Summer break is a time of rest and relaxation for kids who work hard to during the school year; consequently, it's inevitable that students will forgot information they have learned since they are not typically using their brain power while relaxing. To avoid this problem, summer projects are assigned to keep the minds of the students active and to prepare them for the next school year. Obviously, many students struggle with these projects because they are required to follow uninteresting, hard to understand guidelines set by the teachers. But, some may agree that giving students teacher-designed summer projects is necessary because it ensures that everyone has the same level of difficulty and students can receive help easier due to the usage of a rubric specifically for the project. Clearly, they are incorrect because student-based summer projects allow students to move at a pace that is appropriate for them and give students incentives to work harder.

Schoolwork is difficult to each student for different reasons; moreover, no student is the same and should not have to work at a level that is too difficult for them. Teacher-designed projects discourage students from working in such a way that benefits them since they must follow a rubric that limits them. That rubric does not give students an opportunity to work in such a way that is unique to them because the rubric requires perfect, ""textbook"" solutions. Also, teacher-designed projects are often confusing and may require thinking that is outlandish, or too difficult to understand. This further proves that projects not created by students aren't beneficial because some students can't grasp onto certain concepts or thinking processes different from the ones they have previously been using. Despite this, some may still agree with assigning students teacher-based projects over the summer because everyone receives the same assignment, therefore the level of difficulty is the same for everyone. However, they are incorrect because everyone is unique, has their own way of understanding certain situations, and solves problems in different ways.

Doing something created by you is completely different from doing something made by another person. When you are given the opportunity to freely express yourself, it will most likely give you incentive to complete it. This directly connects to allowing students to create their own summer projects because giving students the opportunity to explore something that interests them creates motivation. In addition to that, student-designed projects will ultimately lead to better grades. Having motivation to complete something will make you put more effort into the assignment. On the contrary, some people may continue to insist that teacher-designed projects lead to better scores because students can receive easily help due to the criteria made specifically for the project. However, they are wrong because student-designed projects are more beneficial to grades because they make students more motivated, and motivation leads to more effort placed into the project.

Taking all of the information provided into consideration, student-designed summer projects are a better option than teacher-designed summer projects because students are more motivated to do better on assignments they create and they are able to work in such a way that helps them succeed. It's important to realize that students are not perfect and do not think in the same way that someone else might. Teacher-designed summer projects are not used to ensure that students are trying their best; instead, they are only used to make sure students are doing something that makes their brain work, even if they don't understand it. Repeatedly working on something that you can not comprehend is useless and is not beneficial. We know that the true goal of summer projects is to prepare students for the next school year. If you want students to be prepared, then give them something they not only understand, but enjoy as well. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
0C636735B18E,"Summer projects are not as fun as they sound, Although, being able to design your own sounds interesting. As the school year ends, students expect an endless summer with adventures and tons of trips, however, a project must be due in the beginning of the next school year. Teachers begin to brainstorm ideas and assignments for the next school year as well. Allowing the students to design their own projects would make their summer a lot more interesting than it sounds. If the students designed their own summer projects it would make the students' summer more about creativity, it would allow the teacher to observe the students' mindset, and benefit the teacher to create a lesson comparing different perspectives.

The one thing every student has in common is the enjoyment of summer break. A one-to-two month period of no school, heavy sunshine, fun trips, long vacations, and valuable memories. Students expect to have fun and enjoy their summer break away from school. Allowing the students to design their projects would let the student now be more creative and will allow their brain to think more in depth about the project than when a teacher designs it. Their summer will be educational and entertaining.

In the first few weeks of school, teachers tend to struggle to get to know their students. If the student designed their projects, it will benefit them because they will be able to observe how their student thinks in different scenarios. They will save more time not only getting to know the student but grading as well, instead of multiple ""get to know you"" packets that they create every year. It will decrease the stress of getting to know the students they have that year.

When the new school year approaches, students expect to write about themselves and hear about the class criteria and behaviors. A quick lesson can be taught based on the projects the students designed. It would behoove the teacher to do a quick lecture about the assignment and why it was given. It becomes a great team building exercise as well by comparing the projects and explaining the goal of the assignment.

Overall, students designing their projects would not only benefit themselves but the teachers as well to learn about each other and the subject. Designing a project is not easy, having summer experiences can help with that. It would allow the student to embrace their creativity and think outside the box. It would also be helpful for the teachers to observe more on their students' mindset. Lastly, it would help the students and teachers' communication in education based on their overall observation.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
200AA7A37060,"Over the years many schools have assigned summer projects as a way to help keep students minds active while on break. These projects can include reflection essays, construction, reading catalogs, and many other wonderful things. At the moment many of these projects are designed by the teachers, however many schools are considering switching to projects designed by the students. Students designed teacher approved projects would be better for the future of education as they would allow students to think critically, increase their desire to learn, and tailor projects to their strengths and learning styles.

To begin student designed projects allow for more creativity and critical thinking rather than fallowing a check list the teacher created. Most teacher designed projects rely on specific structures and check list drawn up by the teacher for the students to fallow. They do no prompt the students to: think, learn, ponder, and reflect, rather they give students a list of mundane tasks to complete and check off. Critical thinking and complex learning comes from hands on practice thought and refection. Giving a student a complex prompt or problem and allowing them to design the project themselves in order to answer it, stimulates the brain far more than handing the student an assignment where the answers have already been neatly planed and laid out by the teacher. For a better education students need to be able to solve problems on their own and chart their own waters, they will never grow if they are always defendant on a teacher to tell them what to do and how to do it.

Furthermore student designed projects allow students to focus on things they find interesting and want to learn about increasing their overall desire to learn. Often times struggling students or children who ""hate"" school may just feel bored and there are many students who don't try in school because they feel like the subjects they study have no purpose or that it will have no value for their future career. These students often do not participate in teacher designed summer projects as many see summer as their time off from the burden of school and teacher projects appear as boring and useless to them. If these students were allowed to design hear projects, however, so that they focused on topics important to them there could very well be an increase in their participation and desire to learn. When people study things they like and enjoy the often perform better this can be seen at schools like the Generic_School MATA programs where every student who attends wants to be there and as a result they are active and engaged each day. It can be inferred that if the logic applied to the MATA programs is applied to summer projects, students studying things they enjoy increases learning motivation, more students would participate and find value in summer projects.

In addition to the a fore mentioned points student design projects could be tailored to a students academic need and strengths in a way teacher designed projects are not. While many teachers say no child left behind that is often not the case with summer projects. Because these projects are assigned before the teacher gets the chance to really know the students a it is difficult to adjust to a students specific needs. A teacher may assign project with lots of heavy reading not knowing that a few of her students are dyslexic, or a different teacher may assign something on a topic many of the students are already well versed in so it has little value to repeat it. Student designed projects would avoid these conflicts as the students know themselves best and could be able to tailor their project to their strengths. Many English classes have already found success in doing this where instead of assigning books that students may have already read or are difficult for some to read, these classes allow students to study books of their choice or listen to audio books. Student designed projects are often more applicable to students lives and as a result they are a better form of education and learning than teacher designed projects.

Some may contradict that student designed projects would promote laziness and the students would not learn anything of value from them. This is why these projects would have to be teacher approved; however, even if they are not the value of learning to think and the other benefits of student designed projects outweighs the over specified structure of the teacher designed projects.

In the end student designed projects are most beneficial to students due to their freedom to allow for critical thinking, the study of subjects students enjoy increasing learning motivations, and their unique ability to be tailored to each students needs. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
A4F51DBB6338,"Summer is a time where many students forget about school and let their academic stress go for a sweet couple of months. During this time, however, students tend to let go of their knowledge and desire to learn as well. Summer assignments/projects given from school are widely regarded as a way to keep students engaged in their learning during the vacation months. There is the question, however, of how to go about designing these assignments; should the teacher design the project, or should the student design their own? I believe summer projects should be student-designed, because it provides an opportunity for students to explore what interests them, and ensures that they can take personal initiative in their own learning.

Students who are tasked with designing their own projects get to explore their creativity in relation to their academics. In my years as a student, I have found that, when given the freedom to design my own assignments or projects, I feel much more encouraged to tap into my creative side. An example of this is when I was assigned a ""personal project"" by my English teacher in eighth grade. For this project, I was given the liberty of choosing my own subject, how I researched, and what my medium for presentation would be (written paper, powerpoint, video, etc.). Completing this assignment on my own terms opened my eyes to how pleasant and fulfilling learning can be when it is something I am actually interested in doing. I believe that this same concept of student-designed learning should be integrated into summer projects. Doing this will help students associate school and learning with things that are interesting and engaging, instead of stressful and boring.

In addition to keeping students engaged, student-designed projects will teach pupils to take control of their academic endeavors, and facilitate their transition into a more independent learning style. In my current experience of researching universities, I am aware of the drastic change in style between high school and college. For example, high school is very structured and organized, with several classes a day, every day, for a specific 7 hour period. College, on the other hand, leaves a student with much more freedom and time on their hands, similar to summer break in that aspect, especially when attendance is not manditory for some classes. It is vital for one to know how to manage their own learning and take that initiative to complete their work in a timely manner. If a student has no desire/motivation to learn, as well as no responsibility over their own learning, they will struggle greatly in a college environment. However, if schooling implements a more student-designed approach, students will have the opportunity to practice independence, responsibility, and perhaps most importantly, learn their own way and what works best for them as an individual.

Some people may disagree with my stance, claiming that the majority of students are incompetent in designing an adequate project for themselves, that they need the control of a teacher-designed project to guide them over the summer and keep them on track. On the contrary, I feel the opposite is true. If a student is not ""responsible enough"" to lead ther own learning yet, then it is school's duty to teach them that valuable life skill, instead of confining them with more pressure and constrictions that will only grow their disdain for school in general. Without the weight of a teacher bearing down on them, students are able to grow a passion for learning that they perhaps had never known before. Once school stops being seen as a chore or a nag is when students can unlock their full potential as life-long learners. Developing the skills associated with student designed projects will help them in any future endeavors, whether it be academic or carreer related.

In conclusion, summer projects most definitely should be student-designed, due to the opportunity for exploration, growth, and responsibility it can provide. It is common knowledge that everybody learns in a different way. It is very easy for children and teens to develop a negative attitude towards school, especially when they are constantly assigned projects that do not utilize their individual learning style. However, students need to understand that education leads to freedom in life; the freedom to pursue a carreer, to make informed opinions, and to never stop learning new things. Academic education should be treated as such. Students can and will reform their ideas of learning if simply given more freedom to take charge of their education, in whatever little ways possible. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
20C01368FC3E,"Summer break is a time for everyone to decompress and relax after a long school year. Projects over break are stressful, especially teacher-designed ones. Breaks should be spent having fun and spending time with family/friends. Students work their butts of enough during the year and shouldnt have to do that over summer. Summer projects should be student-designed because it'll give students a chance to make the project chill, it will allow more independence for the students, and it will have a better chance of making the students summer adventurous.

The one thing students ask of the most would be a laid back summer. Because of all the stress they endure during the year, students want a bit of time to reflect and relax. If students make their own projects they could make it very simple. Most may think of that as taking a shortcut through life, but in reality they do enough work as it is in school. If teachers made the projects, chances are they'd want to challenge the students a lot. When projects are teacher-designed students are less likely to complete it. To add on students wouldn't want to ruin their schedule with a boring project that their teacher designed; they'd want their project to be less time consuming during break.

One key factor for students is a sense of independence. Students are growing older and majority of them want to do tasks on their own. Doing their own projects would give them that freedom. The project could also be a way for them to boost their confidence in what they are capable of doing. It would be a great way for them to see how being independent with certain things is like. Student-designed projects may be a way for students to teach themselves responsibility. It would give them a greater aspect of being able to deal with time management skills. Furthermore they wouldn't be relying on their teachers for specific things such as: making a due date, setting up the project, making specific directions, etc.

Most students enjoy exploring over summer; and what better way to do it than through a project. Student-designed projects would allow students to create it however they want. Even if it's a group project or even one where they'd need to actually go somewhere. Teachers wouldn't make it all that interesting, they'd just add a few things to make it ""fun"" but not to where a student would get excited. If students want more time with friends and family, they could add things into the project to make that happen. Teachers are known as the ""fun killers"", so students would get the chance to take matters into their own hands and fix that.

Overall people may think teacher-designed projects are better because of teachers ""knowing what they are doing"", but that is not always true. It is good to let students take over sometimes. It is also a great way for teachers to see the potential for their students. Student- designed projects can show one's creativity and imagination. Teachers don't always get to see that side of students during the year. To conclude it all students should be able to design their own projects to attain their independence, add some adventure to their break, and gain a relaxing summer break.                                                                  ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
17D10719473B,"Some teachers always told me "" you can never stop learning"".

You can really never stop learning, and teachers know that. Thats why teachers should design summer projects, to help a student be above what they were the following year,and help them have a jump start when they go into the next year by helping them retain information and having them explore into the subject they are going to learn the next year. Its good to remember that the key to learning is to never stop learning, and teacher know that the best.

Some teachers like to give assignments to students over the summer to help them retain any information that can help them in their next year if school. English teacher usually let students pick a book and they have to write a essay or give a presentation about the book. Other teachers might have you explore what you are going to learn next year and make you do a project on the subject you are going into next year to see if it can give you a jump start in your subject. With this jump start you will be above other students who were not given a summer project by their teacher, assuring that you will succeed in your subject.

Teachers will normally give the student all summer to finish their project. This is more than enough time to do a project especially during summer break because you have more time during the day. During the school year teachers give a time period to finish a project and it is usually a lot shorter than 2 months. Students should have no excuse to not be able to finish a summer project assigned by their teacher. With having 2 months to do an assignment you can break it up in parts and do it throughout the whole break to help you even more o retain information.

Coming back to school with a fresh memory is the key to succeed. It will help you go back to school already feeling refreshed with everything you need to know. If a student were to design a project to do over the summer they would make it about stuff they are already good at or mastered, When a teacher designs it, it's to help you learn something you will need for the next year. When teachers design these projects its to help students and some students don't really understand. They think it's just a teacher giving them work to do over the break they are not supposed to have work during, but its designed to help them learn.

Giving a summer assignment is a way to never stop learning. I believe teachers should design the projects students do because they usually know what students need to know for the up-coming year. Teacher like to assign summer projects so students can continue learning even after their long summer break. This isn't a bad idea, after all, they give the students around 2 months to finish the project depending on how long their break is. This will help students retain some information that can help them in their up-coming school year so they can have a fresh memory coming back. If students were to design a school project they would usually take advantage and not give themselves a good enough project to help them retain information.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
1175204C51AF,"School projects offer students with the chance to a more engaging and creative way of learning through their own forms of research, application, and presentation of what they are learning about in school. During school, projects are often based off of particular subjects of study in different classes, such as making shapes with parabola equation graphs in Algebra II or a poster of the effects of the Battle of Generic_City in WWII in AP World History. Although projects during the school year offer a new path of more in depth learning for many students, summer projects outside of school can offer new skills, learning, and engagement beyond the classroom and can sharpen students' minds for the next school year ahead of them. Summer projects should not only act as a new form of learning, but should also act as a freeway for students' creativity, passions, and interests to travel through their work. Summer projects should be student-driven and designed in order to keep the student engaged and interested in what they are doing, to allow them the freedom of summer vacation, and to increase the value of what they learned to them and their intellectual development.

During the summer, students have more time to focus on what they enjoy and are engaged in. From traveling to sports, students have way more interest in things they enjoy doing in the summer rather than teacher-designed school activities and projects, things that they have experienced throughout the whole school year prior. Students should have the opportunity to learn about something that they are interested in in order to keep them engaged and do their best work on the summer project. Although basic guidelines should be given by teachers of broad knowledge of instructions to give the student a framework, students should be able to pick a topic and media that will keep them motivated to complete the project to the best of their ability. For example, if a student is interested in the environmental issues facing the Amazon Rainforest, the summer should be an opportunity for them to show their interest in that particular subject while also learning valuable lessons of accountability and new learning for a school grade.

Summer is also a time for students to have freedom from the walls of their school building and to experience new and exciting things. This is another reason why summer projects should be student-designed: students should have the opportunity to learn through ways that they love and are engaged in, allowing them freedom to grow and learn through their own motivations. If summer projects for students were teacher-designed, already handing students a topic, media, and specific guidelines, a student would loose the value of summer freedom and the break from school-designed activities and projects. This could lead the student to become less engaged, less responsible, and less-likely to do their best work, due to being confined by teacher-given provisions. Students already experience this throughout an entire school year and should be able to have freedom in what they focus their summer work on. This will not only enable them to be interested and passionate about what they are doing, but also will allow them to have the freedom that they have all been craving throughout the school during the summer months of vacation.

Finally, students should be able to choose their summer project in order to increase the value of what they learned to themselves and their intellectual development. Often when a student is given a project or activity by a teacher of something that they are not as interested in, students become less likely to actually retain what they are learning and are not able to grow as freely or nearly as much. In comparison, when students are given the opportunity to pick their topic of study and focus along with how they are going to complete the project, students will be able to value what they are learning so much more because of their passion and interest in the subject. This allows for students to grow intellectually during the months away from school while also letting them focus on a topic or media that they love.

Summer projects can be extremely beneficial to students and their learning outside of the classroom while also giving the student a way to express their passions and interests. This is necessary for a student to stay engaged, learn with value, and to do their work to the best of their ability. This not only allows a student to continue to learn during the summer months, but also gives a student the freedom to learn new knowledge of topics that they are interested in and enjoy.            ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
6B7FFEA03FE5,"Imagine, your school requiring you to do teacher designed projects while your on summer break. School's want to make sure their students are still learning during their time off, but is this the right way to do it? I think the students should be able to pick what type of project they want to do because, it will be something they are interested about.

If students are told to do a project about something they have no interest in, they either wont complete it, or will do a bad job on it. Especially without the teacher being right there to answer any questions they might have about the assignment. Students that get to choose their project will have more drive to want to do it, because its something they are interested in. They won't look at it as an assignment but as a learning experience for them to learn more about what they already enjoy.

It also gives students the ability to imagine and be creative when it comes to making the project for their self. Students will be more hands on and exited to do something that they get to pick oppose to a teacher rubric they would have to follow to complete the assignment. Also they might get bored and loose motivation throughout the teacher designed project. If students design their own projects it makes them put more thought behind it and use more creativity.

Students may not like the idea of doing schoolwork over their break, but if they get to choose what they do they might be more intrigued by the assignment. Although it might be harder for some students to come up with their own ideas, in the long run it will be more fun for them. Learning about something you are interested in, is a lot easier oppose to learning about something you dont care about. Getting students engaged in the assignment is the main point of making them complete one.

If students are engaged in learning more about something they enjoy, the knowledge about the topic will most likely stay in their mind better than something they either dont want to write about or dont know anything about. Furthermore if a student has a question on the assignment or doesnt know how to do something who are they supposed to ask when its summer and they are at home? Another reason why students should be able to pick their project is because, if its something they arent interested in they arent going to want to spend their time off doing it. Teacher designed projects are never going to get done over summer break, but let the student pick the project and you have a better chance to see a completed project.

I feel like students should definitely be able to pick their project based on how students are with assigned work they dont want to do. It gives a great learning experience and teaches independence for students who might need other life skills before they graduate high school. It not only teaches the students responsibility to have the project done but it teaches a lot more because they have to start from scratch and use their own ideas. Its a part of maturity to understand tasks and jobs that have to be complete.               ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
C8C6FF614971,"Teachers usually believe they know whats best for their students, since from a time long past they were students too, but that is not necessarily true. Its been a long time since teachers roamed the halls of high school or middle school, and things have changed. This is why students need to be the ones designing summer projects since students are the ones doing them, the stress of students and the balance between work and fun.

This next bit is simple, since students are the ones doing the projects they should be the ones to design it. Although during the school year teachers design most if not all homework that comes the students way, that homework is not on the same scale as a summer project. With a summer project you are given the whole summer to finish the project and since it is on such a large scale and affecting so much time, students should be the ones designing the projects. Students being the ones to complete the projects is not the only reason.

Stress is a fickle thing; not enough of it and nothing will get done, but if theres to much your whole life can fall apart. Students and teachers experience different kinds of stress. Students stress about turning things in on time or being on their best behavior. While teachers stress about being nice to students, while still giving discipline. When a student is expected to complete such a large project such as a summer one, they get stressed. Yet if the student is able to be the one who designs and creates the project, it can have no stress involved. Stress is an important part of why students should be the ones designing summer projects but expectations put into place by the teacher play a part aswell.

Expectations play quite the role these days, they cause people to flourish or dissapoint. Dissapointment is what will happen to those few students who never go above and beyond, but stay average if teachers design these projects. Students have many things to worry about during the school year, but during the summer theres not as many. Which is why something as small as this project can cause extreme harm to a student with a project designed by a teacher that requires them to go 100% and their only capable of 80%. This is why students need to design projects, so that everyone can get the score their expectations they believe.

Expectations, stress levels and students doing the projects, are all reasons why students should be the ones to design summer projects and not teachers. Summer is a time of clarity for students and teachers alike, they dont have to worr about grades or waking up early to go to school and it should stay that why. All in all students and teachers both have their own strengths and weakness, but one of a students stregths is their ability to design summer projects.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
AB83C89D3124,"As a high school student, school is very stressful to me. A big part of that stress has to do with big projects and tests that we have to do and take during school. The summer is our time to get off of school and take a break from learning but that would make it so much harder to get back to our normal routines when school rolls around again. Summer projects are the answer! The only thing wrong with them is that they don't engage the students because we aren't in the mood to do boring school work during our summer vacation. School projects done in the summer should be student-designed to increase willingness to participate, make students think creativley, and give the teachers a break from doing extra work over the summer.

If summer projects were student-designed, students would be more willing to participate. When a teacher designs a project, students usually become bored and annoyed, while also dreading to do the work. If a student designed their own project, the work would be less boring and more fun. This would increase the students willingness to participate by giving them a project that they designed to fit to their likings.

Student-designed summer projects would not only make the students use their brain when they are doing the project, but also make them use their brain while they are making it. The making of the project is a project in itself. This will force students to think creativley and use their minds. They will also be pushed into creating something they actually think is interesting as they will be the ones participating in it.

Teachers, especially in high school, do so much planning throughout the year. If students took the time to design a project that would not only benefit the students, but it would give the teachers a break over their summer. All teachers would have to do is approve their students project and grade it. This would make add another pro to the column for student-designed projects as it would not only benefit the students, but the teachers as well.

Student-designed summer projects have an overall benefit from teachers to students. They make students want to actually do the work, make the teachers life easier, and make the students use a more creative side of them. Although no student would like to do school work on their summer vacation, this is the best most efficient way to make them want to do it. Students will no longer start to dread projects if this is how they will be assigned. Student-designed summer projects are the best way to make this process easiest for everyone involved!",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
DF071F7D4B04,"The sound of the final bell of the school year ringing, the rushing of students out the front door as they are saying goodbye to their friends, and the delightful, warm summer breeze flowing in the wind excites most students as they approach summer break. While summer may mean that students can have downtime and go on family vacations, they should retain the information that they learned from school by completing summer projects. The purpose of summer projects is to make sure that students will not fall behind over break. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because they know what will be taught in the class, they can strengthen their students' skills that would be needed throughout the year, and they can give kids an experience for what the class will be like.

To begin, summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers know what the curriculum looks like for the class. Teachers that know what the curriculum looks like allows them to know what to include in projects to help students prepare for the fall. For example, a teacher can assign a summer book report that focuses on Greek tragedies to prepare students for literature by Shakespeare. Teachers that know what the curriculum looks like will also know what skills can be used to ease the process of learning new material. For instance, teachers may give out a poetry project that focuses on figurative language to help students improve their writing for the upcoming school year. In addition, teachers that also know what the curriculum looks like can allow students to have a head start into the new year. An example of this is if students know what will be taught the first few weeks of school, there will be more time to work on other skills and more time for review at the end of the year for finals. Overall, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they know how to prepare their new students for the upcoming year.

In addition, summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers can strengthen students' skills. Teachers can strengthen students' skills through summer projects because they can assign work that will focus on important skills. For instance, a teacher can look through their lessons and pick out the skills that will be useful to have students review such as sentence structure and grammar editing. Teachers can also improve skills through summer projects because they can include skills that other students in the past struggled with so that the new students can have a better understanding of those skills. For example, if prior students struggled with persuasion skills such as ethos, pathos, and logos, teachers can help introduce these skills to students in a way that helps them to use persuasion skills in an appropriate manner. In addition, teachers can enhance students' skills because they can improve potential difficulties to achieve student accuracy. An example of this is teachers that know a particular topic such as counterclaims may be slightly tedious to students, so they help students over the summer learn how to plan and organize their counterclaim. Furthermore, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they can sharpen students' skills to keep them focused.

Finally, while teacher-designed summer projects can enhance student learning, one might argue that teacher-designed projects do not give students an opportunity to thrive in creativity however, it is important that students begin to thrive in their academics over the summer. Students can thrive in their academics over the summer through teacher-designed projects because teachers can give students an insight of what the class will be like. Teachers can give an insight on what their class will be like because teachers can create projects that focus on different types of writing styles. For example, teachers can prepare students to write persuasive essays such as why people should go to the beach over the summer or go to a historic place because they will allow students to work on their persuasion skills and how to organize their essay. In addition, teachers can also give students an outlook on what their class will be like because teachers can have students review over math skills that might be used in other lessons. An example of this is a student who is taking Pre-Calculus in the upcoming school year can review over tangent, sine, and cosine from geometry to make sure that they have the basic fundamentals of geometry covered to be successful. Teachers can also help students to gain experience of what the class will be like because teachers can give students a preview of how challenging a course may be. For instance, a student who is preparing to take Advanced Placement English can gain experience of what the homework will be like. To close, even though students will not be able to flourish in their creativity through summer projects, they will save time in the upcoming school year knowing that they have what it takes to excel in their classes.

In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they will know what will be taught in class, they can improve students' skills, and they can give kids an experience of what the class will be like. Even though students will not be able to express their creativity skills, they will excel in the upcoming year by knowing that they will not fall behind during the summer. Overall, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they know what will be expected out of students and they will help to make sure students meet their expectations.     ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
E5ADCFEF9D75,"Summer projects, even though most kids disagree with these being assigned in the summer, are a great way to make sure kids keep being productive and expanding their knowledge throughout the summer. That makes them very important since most kids detach themselves from school related activities in the summer and making students have a project done by the beginning of the school year, will make sure they are ready to come to school, be productive, and learn. Summer projects should be student-designed because it will make the student have more fun and expand their creativity while also assuring the best results.

Summer is about being able to do whatever and have fun. While some students believe that big summer projects could take away from the fun, making them student- designed will ensure that students make them based on things that they enjoy. Also, having students design their projects will make them really think and be creative. When grading these projects, teachers should partially grade them off of creativity. These types of projects can be truly amazing because they can show how creative kids can be when given time and a choice and show what great things they are capable of.

Kids always do better when they are inspired and have the choice to do things their way. People are able to show their best when they are inspired and enjoy what they are doing. A great example of this can be seen in the workplace in the way that people that don't enjoy what they do for a living do not normally give the best results. This always applies to every one.

Even though student-designed projects are great, teacher-designed projects are more predictable and easier to grade. If teachers design the projects, then most students will do similar things unlike with student-designed projects. If every student does something different, then the grading system for them will be a lot more complex making it a lot more difficult on the teachers.

Although student-designed projects are unpredictable and more diverse. They promote all the good things about learning and make sure that they are making the best out of their summers. The positives completely outweigh the negatives since you are able to see the great potential all kids contain if they work on things that they are passionate about.         ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

First, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to do what they want. For example, students will become more interested in the project if it is about what they want. Therefore, they will put more effort and more time into the project because they get to express themselves. If the students came up with the project idea then it is axiomatic they will complete the project. The project ideas the students choose directly reflects upon them, which means there is a higher chance they will be entitled to completing it. Furthermore, a student-designed project creates a sense of freedom in the students mind. To add to, if students get freedom on projects, then their academics will most likely skyrocket. In summary, student-designed summer projects encourage students to complete it with hard work and perseverance.

Second, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the teachers to learn more about the students. These projects give off a sense of how the teachers should treat the students. For example, if the student does poorly on the project and is very weak in presenting, then the teacher should know what to do. The teacher should gather the information and come to a conclusion which states that the student needs help. However, if a student does a really emotional and heart touching project then the teacher should get involved. The teachers should try and communicate with the students and sympathize towards them, and maybe even take it a little easy on them since they are going through a tough time. If a student presents a project which is reflecting on their past and the obstacles they overcame, then the teacher should ask questions. In other words, they should try and learn more about the students past, so the teachers will have an understanding of how they can help the students in the future. To put it all together, student-designed summer projects should be a way for the teachers to truly learn and understand about how the students are where they are.

Third, summer projects should be student-designed because it allows the students to be themselves. For example, students should feel free about doing a project. They should not have to be held to a standard which they might never get to. Teachers should rather help the students get to the standard rather than just telling the students they have to get there. In projects, students should be able to talk about whatever they choose to. They should not have to be limited to one project idea. To add to, limiting what students have to do a project is how their grades start to drop. One of the most important thing a student should be able to do on a student-designed summer project is to express their feelings and talk about what their heart tells them to do. The whole point of a student-designed project should be to help students talk about what is bothering them instead of limiting them to one idea. In one idea, student-designed summer projects should be a way for students to be unique and different in a world where everyone is trying to be like each other.

In conclusion, student-designed summer projects are a way for students to express their deepest feelings and their wildest dreams. If summer projects are student-designed, then teachers will know how each student should be taught. Students should confront their teachers and tell them why their summer projects should be student-designed. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
AD97126ECA8A,"Summer is the students time to do whatever they like or want. When a teacher give the students summer project desingn by them, the students will feel like they still in school and that will effect students. Summer project should be student-designed because it is their time, they know what a better design for them, and some students like to experience the real world instead of doing project.

It is their time. Summer break is the time for student to do something out of school and to do something students would really like to do. Some students like to play sports like soccer, football, and basketball. Other students like to play video games on the summer break. Summer break for some of students is for them to set a goal like reading a 100 books, visiting 10 new counties, and to learn 100 new words. Summer break is special for students.

They can design what they think is right for them. Each students is different from the other, they have different thing to do and no one will really know them like their friends. Instead of the teacher designing the summer project, the student's friend can design the project for them since they know each other better than everyone else. The student's friend will choose a subject that their friend know a lot about it and love it. Teacher can give the students ideas for the summer project but student can choose them or pick what summer they would like to do.

Some students like to experience something to learn. Some of the students like to experience the thing they are learning about it instead of reading or doing 20 pages of writing. Some students do like to read and write instead of experience it and their friend should know that. Many student are looking for jobs in the summer break so they can make some cash and get experience for the future when they get a job. Experience something can be totally different than reading about it like diving, traveling, and playing sport. Some things are better to experience than reading.

Some people may say teacher should design the summer break project, however; summer project should be student-designed because it is their time, they know what a better design for them, and some students like to experience the real world instead of doing project. Some students get depressed because of school and sometimes leaving them to do design their project may help them get better.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
E0A4A5FB3C3D,"Projects over summer break should be teacher-designed instead of student-designed so it provides a challenge, provides a glimpse of how the class will be taught, and if complications were to occur the certain individual can contact the teacher.

If students designed the summer projects they would make it easy for them to complete. The projects should require hard work and effort, as opposed to little effort if designed by a student. The project wouldnt be preposterous, just hard enough so that a challenge is provided.

Students can become accustomed to his or her teaching methods. Also, it helps parents know what to do if later on during the year the student is having complications. Scholars can better prepare themselves ahead of time if they're confused about the methods.

Teachers can easily contact the student. In addition to that, the student can also contact the teacher if they have further questions or problems. If this was student-designed it'll be hard for the professor to reach the particular student or group.

Over the summer, teachers believe that students will forget information that they just learned during the school year. So due to that matter, debates over if projects should be assigned during summer break are still controversial till this day. summer projects will make teens become more responsible and make them manage their time wisely. On the other hand, they'll come into school on top of that particular subject.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
BCBD7D07903C,"I think that the summer project should be student-designed. A big reason as to why it should be student-designed is the students should be able to understand the project without needing help from the students teacher. They won't have their teachers at home. If the project was teacher-designed it most likely would'nt make sense to a majority amount of the students. Regardless either its student-designed or teacher-designed they should be able to learn something from it.

Teachers assign projects for classes that they know they're going to need to remember certain material. My freshman history teacher had assigned a packet for a class I was taking the next year (AP human geography). Not many students had done it due to the fact that it was very complex and very teacher-designed. There was a lack of motivation because, students didnt find much interest. Most teachers dont think that,that effects a students work effort. Having a student-designed project makes students understand it more, have motivation to do it, and also, have it complete on time.

Everything students have done throughout the whole year had been teacher-designed, having one project during their summer student-designed would really motivate them to do their best and take their time onto doing their best. As a student I say this because,to me this is true. I feel most motivated when I can connect to my school work. Its our project we will spend the most time with it, why not make it our own? Most students dont want to do school work during summer break, I mean who would ? but if there is no way of stopping the work from coming why not let it be a time to learn for ourselves and it the project be in our hands fully.

I think summer projects should be student-designed, give us our chance to make school work outside of school our own.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
9FD65F435FD4,"Requiring students a summer project to extend their academic progression is extremely intelligent, however should the summer project be teacher- designed or student- designed. For me this is simple, letting students design their project would give them control of their summer the way they desire, could become an amazing social experience, and give a chance to show their creativity.

To begin with, the summer is basically one of the only times student get a break from school and no student wants to have to work during it, but allowing them to design their own project gives them the opportunity to work out how and what their going to do and can provide them a much more manageable schedule. Allowing them to fit in any other activities they wanted to indulged in that summer. Such as, summer camps, road trips, internships, etc. Then both parties are happy and fulfilled with what happened that summer.

Secondly, depending on how the students go about the design of their project it could become an extremely fun social experience. Especially when interacting with peers on what topic their going to do, coming together to making groups and working on the project over break, showing each other designs, and giving opinions on each others topics. This could become very fun and memorable experience for these young adults and impact them for the rest of their lives.

furthermore, as educational as school is it lacks one major and crucial thing, creativity. schools can be extremely bad when it comes to providing a platform to express yourself on, but giving students the ability to design their own project can incorporate their style in whatever way they choose. Instead of force feeding them a topic they have no interested in, inevitably causing reluctant behavior towards the project. Being in tune with your creative side creates a entrepreneurs mindset, allowing you to think outside box getting you away from common thinking.

In Conclusion, allowing students to design their own project can come with many benefits. Providing them the freedom needed to enjoy the summer, independent thinking, social skill, and most importantly creativity. And all these life skills from giving the task of one simple project.    ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
32926CBD644F,"It is August 5th and my friend Generic_Name can not hang out today, and I am pretty sad about that. If only he had chosen an easier topic for his summer project, and done it earlier. Although some believe otherwise students should be able to design their own project, because they will have the creativity factors that controlled projects would not, they can choose their own subject, and they have an increased growth in responsibility.

Us students love the creativity aspect of getting to choose how we get to work. We hate being bound to guidelines and rules set by other people. Whenever I get to choose how I do my projects I always seem to do better on them when I get to be more creative. A couple of months ago, my AP Environmental sciences teacher let us choose an end of year project. She said ""as long as you get it in on time, I do not care what or how you do it. The project just has to pertain towards some of the topics that we learn during the course."" I loved getting that freedom from her, because I got to do it how I wanted and I got to be more creative with it too. I ended turning in that project within a month, because it was something that I wanted to do. If I was bound to the rules I would have procrastinated until the night before it was due. Some may disagree, saying that they are more likely to do the project when guidelines are given and when students are forced not to be creative. That reasoning is flawed due to the fact that my friend Generic_Name was given a similar project, but with guidelines saying the stuff that she could and could not do. She has always been better than me at turning in assignments. When I found out that I had turned in my project before her ,I was astonished. I asked her why she had not not done yet. She said that she had not even figured out what she was going to do. She was bound to do what she was told to do and she lost the creativity factor that she has always loved. Creativity is vital to a students success when doing projects. It ensured that every project is different and more entertaining than traditional projects.

Getting to choose a subject also makes the project more enjoyable for the students. If students were given a choice to select a subject that they would do a summer project on, they would most likely choose the subject that they feel more confident in. My mother always says that she loved to do projects on history (which was her favorite subject when she was in high school). She said that whenever she would get to do a project on it she would get A's and B's every time, but she would get C's on other projects that was not on her favorite subject. This choice in subjects was a morale booster for her. When she got good grades she got more confident and when she got more confident she got better grades. The choice correlated with her mental health and her school life, because she always felt good about her work.

Some say that if we get assigned a subject then we will be more likely to do what the person who grades is looking for. That is not the case, because of my friend Generic_Name. Generic_Name had to do a summer project last year and he had no idea what to do. He called me an asked what my project was on. I told him that me and just about everyone in our friend group was doing our project on History. When the school year started I asked him what he did it on, and he said his project was on Economics. When we got our grades back he had gotten the highest out of all of our friends. This just shows that it is more likely for someone to get a better grade when they get to choose a project subject or topic that they enjoy to do.

In our youthful society responsibility is a huge part of maturing. Getting to choose a project makes kids more responsible in the long run. This past weekend my parents left me home while they went to go watch my sister play lacrosse at Generic_School in Rhode Island. I stayed home with my dog and had a lot of time to myself and to my studies. I could have pushed it off until Sunday night, but I decided to do the responsible thing and do it during the day on Saturday. The choice I made was the right one, because I had the rest of the weekend to myself and got to relax and not stress about having to do my homework. If I can choose to be responsible now then I can be responsible when it comes to a summer project. I think that growth in responsibility will also have a great effect on everyone that does this project. The responsible person would choose to do the project earlier in the summer, but the kids that procrastinate will stress about this until the day before the project is due. Some think that responsibility has nothing to do with this project, that is not true. We are trusted to be responsible young men, women, or however people identify themselves. This project is not just about learning at school, but learning about life. When given the choice to do the project how we want to do it responsibility plays a huge factor. Factors like: Will we get it done on time, how will we do it, what topic will we do it on, and if the project actually had time spent on it or if it was just sped through. Us students need to be responsible in order to get in to good colleges, get good jobs, and live good lives. It all starts with projects like these. When all of these factors are put together they are more likely to make us more responsible in the long run.

When we get to choose what we do for projects like these it makes everyone feel good about what they are turning in. It could be the coffee in my system talking, but us students have responsibilities and we need to start being trusted and treated like adults. We want to be creative like adults, think like adults, and live like adults. It all starts with letting us choose a subject for our projects. After all we are the future of society.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
1B2BB2B6DE45,"A project over the summer is a great idea for students to continue to learn. On the other hand, allowing teachers to decide on what students should create isn't the best idea. In the summertime, students love to have fun, create new things, and discover. Leaving the project up to them could challenge their creativity and work ethic. It's not only fun for students, but fun for teachers to see what the students bring back.

During my fifth grade science fair, we were allowed to conduct any experiment we wanted. I decided to blow bubbles and see which gum brand made the biggest bubble. This was fun to do because it was what I thought that made it a successful project. In my opinion, I became proud of myself for taking initiative for completing the assignment on my own.

In addition, when it was time to present my own work I didn't have any problems. I knew what I was talking about and it gave me confidence in front of the class. Sharing all the information I was articulate and when answering questions I was assertive. My teacher was surprised with the quality of my lab and she knew I had put lots of time and effort into this.

Nevertheless, In a teachers perspective of giving a controlled project to students is necessary. They don't always see where things could go wrong. A student could be confused about instructions and do the project completely wrong. Some might feel like it's boring and a waste of time. Giving the student the freedom to illustrate and present their own idea is the most creative way to learn.

Therefore, students designing their own project ideas surpass teachers. Making it fun to learn instead of what might feel like a burden. Teachers determine effort and creativity for the most part. It's up to students to demonstrate correctly. Could you do it on your own? ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
E8DB38E62A2A,"Although frowned upon student, summer work, more specifically summer projects are a great way to assure students continue learning during their break and to prevent any halts in their learning process. To maximize the potential gains, these summer projects should be student-designed, as doing so would enable students to be more creative, allow students to focus on what they need to improve, and it would increase student initiative and interest.

Firstly, student-designed summer projects are a great way to enable student creativity. By giving students the option to design and come up with their project (which is, of course, in relation to the class/course), it gives them an opportunity to use their creative minds which they rarely get to use due to the general school structure. In life, it's usually the most creative and unique things that are recognized and viewed highly. For example, in a school science fair, rather than the cliche volcano winning, first place would usually go to something more unique or creative. The same idea can be applied outside of school. For example, Tesla and SpaceX founder Elon Musk is most well known not just for these companies, but for the incredibly unique and more creative way he manages and runs the businesses, and the way he conducts himself as a businessmen. Through his creative personality, Elon Musk has managed to expand his businesses and appeal to the more casual audience as a fun, regular guy.

In addition to allowing creativity, student-designed projects would allow students to focus on their weaknesses, or in areas they have interest in but previously didn't have the opportunity to delve into. By allowing students to have more control over their projects, it can help students focus on their weaknesses, thus allowing for greater improvement and preparedness heading into the school year. In addition to this, such a project could allow a student to kick start or advance a certain interest, which could prove instrumental to their future. Most people somewhat figure out what they want to do in life by the time they finish school anyways, but having a flexible summer project, especially with the amount of time you would have to research and work on it, could really help with that decision. In addition to finding interests, student-designed projects can also help students identify what they aren't interested, or what their strengths are. Through extensive research and work, students can figure out their strengths and work to them, or find what doesn't interest them and make sure to stay away in order to avoid a future situation where they end up in a class or even job that doesn't enable them to try and work hard.

Finally, by allowing students to have more control and design their projects, it would increase student interest and initiative for the topic at hand. As a student, I have personally found, that while student-designed projects may take longer, they have generally allowed me to connect more with the class and find aspects about the course that interest me. These sorts of projects have also allowed me to take more initiative in my class, by making me think more critically and spend more time coming up with what to do. For example, I once had a project where we had to look at a certain global issue, but we could choose to look from whatever perspective we wanted. After hours of thinking and trying to find an interesting perspective, I came upon an article discussing the view of economists, and, obviously, the way they thought that situation would impact the economy. As one thing lead to another, I ended up thoroughly researching a multitude of different resources and I learned a lot about economics. It was from that one project where I realized how interesting economics is to me, as it just seems to make sense and can be easily applied to the world. This project has resulted in me being in an AP economics class today. There are many others that have had their interests derive from one small moment, and a student-designed project provides a great chance for students to take intiative and find an interest that could lead on to be a great part of their lives.

In summary, while teachers are the experts and know how to get students to learn, directing the project to students by making summer projects student-designed would be more beneficial to students individually. By enabling them to be creative, focus on their interests and weaknesses, and by increasing student initiative, student-designed projects are the best way to assure students get the most out of summer projects.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
AD3821286500,"Summer, as known throughout the whole world, is for relaxation. Now when it comes to students, summer is a school free zone, mentally and physically. Though some teachers believe it is a smart idea to give the students projects or summer reading so they wouldn't forget some of the school work and already have a review over the summer when they come back. That is always expected when schools start back, though not all the students that were assigned to do the assignments did them because they either didn't understand the task correctly or they just wanted to enjoy summer and not think about any school work. That causes both the students and the teachers to be irritated and dissapointed. However, that could be changed by just one small upgrade.

For years, school systems and teachers have been assigning students lessons that they will either never use in the real life or lessons the students don't understand or don't want to learn because the topics don't interest them. Many studies have shown the peak of the students grades is when they are being taught about modern day conflicts or societies, or just topics that interest them. That shows the students want to learn about what relates to them or something they actually want to learn about. Also, some students want to actually earn their grade. As surprising as it is, students want to do their work, because they want to be happy when they get the ""A"" and say that they deserved it because they worked hard on the assignment. Though not all of them can do that because not all of them might understand the assignment. Here, is where the upgrading comes in handy.

School systems need to find new ways of education and renew all of the ""traditional"" ways of teaching. The systems need to understand that these generations are becoming more complicated to teach because of all the new modern trends and technologies. It is becoming easier for the students to understand the lessons from their peers and not the teachers, because it is becoming more difficult each day for the teachers to connect with their students. That is usually either because of social distractions or lack of good communication between the teacher and their students. Though if the teachers and the systems started renovating and thinking about new ways such as: letting the students choose their own topics of what they want to do for summer projects. They can just start from the summer projects, start it off small and see how much of an effect that will make and if it comes out with a pretty positive effect then take action during the actual school months.

Every student does not wish or even want to keep having bad grades in school. Especially because of minor things or because they think they are not smart enough to succeed like their peers. Taking effect in letting students choose what they want to do for their summr projects will make a huge imapct on how the students will learn when they go back to school. That will also affect how the school systems view students learning and will see that it's the best choice to start upgrading their teaching system to the more modern ways. Students will want to actually do their assingments because they will know what they are do it and actually understand it. They will even enjoy what they are doing because they know they will do good because they worked hard on what they are doing.                                          ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
A89C7AADA223,"Students may be assigned projects from their instructors over summer break. This task can be rather frustrating, time consuming, and confusing when made by a teacher. Students have different lives with different perspectives from one another and their teacher. Students may even have a better understanding when a fellow student-peer explains rather than a teacher. Summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed.

If students were to design a summer project, they'd think of the best way to relate to others and compromise to obtain the best connection with others. Students know that others think differently and go to various locations over break, however; it wouldn't exclude them from the assignment, but rather work toward their schedule as planned and give them a topic for a project. This would mean students don't have to consume lots of time researching, won't have trouble completing the assignment, and have fun on break with this student made project that reflects back on, ""Your Summer Vacation"", for example.

Each students see things different from each other and teachers as well. Teachers can be one sided and assign things based off what they think is best for their students, furthermore; this may not be true because students don't think or see like teachers. Students have a huge variety of different perspective on things. So, a project created by students would fit better because of all the ideas sparked up would come together and be at everyone's benefit and not just one specific person. Teachers tend to confuse students with the way they word things at times, where as students have a better understanding of one another and all there different ideas they brainstorm as well. Also, students may have more in common rather than with their teachers because they're more likely influenced by the same stuff that's around their age group like things such as: music, television, social media, and/ or video games.

Many different times there has been students who fail to complete projects assigned by their instructors because of how overwhelming the directions were or how hard it was to process. Students will want the best understanding for each other because we know what's difficult and what is moderate work. Teachers sometimes expect students to do things they can't do on a project; if a student were to design a project, it would get straight to the point and tell you exactly what you need to do in order to complete the task correctly and not wrong while being away from school during the summer. Students also understand that they may even would want to work in a group, especially if there away for break so they can help each other out possibly, but teachers only allow it to to be one person where it may be more challenging without the help of them being at school. Students on break don't want to have to spend their time working on stuff for school, that's why if students made a project, it would educate but not interfere with their freedom,so everybody wins, both teachers and students.

Overall, students don't look toward to doing summer projects, they'd rather go places and have fun with friends and family. However; the task might as well be a fun, student-organized project that is planned to help gain knowledge during break. The results of this would be that students are still learning while they enjoy themselves and not stressing over not being able to understanding what there doing. With the addition of the help from their parents too, students would put in a format where anyone who reads the instructions, knows exactly what to do. Student-designed projects would be the best way for students to learn over summer. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
17AA836BF229,"Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?

During summer break some schools require teachers to give out summer projects to assure that students continue to learn while on vacation. Even though students may not enjoy getting it done, it gives the teacher feedback on how well you are learning in the summertime. These projects are either teacher-designed or student designed. While teacher-designed projects may have it's advantages, summer projects need to be student-designed so that it is less challenging, more motivational to do, and allows the student to get their project done faster.

When projects are teacher-designed, teachers will usually design them as more difficult to do so that it can give their students a challenge to do better. This technique is often done by teachers but what they do not realize is that when teachers design projects that are more challenging it is much harder on the student to understand, let alone get the project done. On the other hand, some students may be out of the country the whole summer so giving them teacher-designed projects that are challenging will give them a harder time for them to learn or get the assignment done.

In the past I have had a very hard time getting most of my projects done because of lack of motivation and because of the way teachers design certain projects. If students are the ones to design it, it will increase the amount of students who do the project because they are the ones who are designing it. In addition making it much more easier for them to understand and get the project done. If summer projects are student-designed, students will not have to use the excuse of not getting the project done because they ""didn't understand it"", instead their will be no excuse because they are the ones who to designed it, not the teacher.

Most students work a lot faster than others because of lack of understanding. Although teachers may not even realize it, they design these projects in ways in which students will often have a hard time with having at least some progress done because they simply do not know where to begin. When the student is the one who is able to design it, it allows them to have the opportunity to decide what to include and what not to, so that it makes their learning easier. In addition, having summer projects be student-designed allows them to work twice as faster than using teacher-designed projects because the student is the one that knows what they have to include.

In conclusion teacher-designed projects may have it's advantages but all projects need to be student-designed because at the end of the day the student is the one who is learning. All projects should be student-designed for these reasons: less challenging, more motivational to do, and allows the student to get their project done faster. Summer projects that are student-designed instead of teacher-designed ensures that the student is more likely to succeed.

1C9ADFB81C4D,"Studies have proven that schools that assign projects and assignments for their students to work on over the summer have seen a much higher success rate in the upcoming school year than if they didn't assign anything. To students, summer projects are not their ideal way to spend their summer and they often procrastinate until the end of the school year. Some projects may be really fun and interesting, but others may be thick packets of mindless busy work that can really take the fun out of summer vacation. Although teachers are around students all of the time, they still have some blind spots as to how they learn the best and what will encourage them to get their work done. If the summer projects that the students are assigned were to be student-designed instead of teacher-designed, there would be a much higher completion rate, less blame on the teacher for the project, and the projects would be better suited to match the students knowledge on the subject.

To start, student-designed summer projects would lead to a higher completion rate. The students would feel more compelled to complete their projects knowing that they were the ones to design it. There's something different about doing something someone else made and is forcing you to do rather than something you took the time to make that you know you will understand when you work on it. For example, you work at a business with a group of people and you were all individually assigned to create a plan of how the company would take on a new project. After you all have presented your separate ideas you've worked really hard on, your boss chooses this other guy's plan over yours. For the next few months, you now have to work on his plan with him controlling everything are doing, which is miserable. If your plan was the one to be chosen, you would have a much better attitude towards working on this plan because you were the one to design it. This scenario works the same with students and teachers. Students don't like being given work during the time that they're supposed to not worry about school, especially when they have no control over the matter. This is the first reason why summer projects should be student-designed.

To add, if summer projects were student-designed, students would be a lot less upset at their teachers for giving them work over the summer. When they go to start working on their projects, they will know what to be expecting, so they won't be blindsided with difficult curriculum that they will spend hours trying to figure out while they are resenting their teachers for making them that stressed over the summer. If they are the ones to design it, they cannot blame their teachers for anything, and they most likely won't find a reason to blame anyone. It would definitely be a good idea to have the teachers set a general level of information they have to know for the upcoming school year so that they don't have the students designing their summer projects with information they already learned in previous years. This way, the teachers will be happy because the students are learning the information they want them to learn, and the students will also be happy because they had control over how they got to complete their work.

Lastly, student-designed summer projects would give students the opportunity to design the curriculum given to them in a way that they can understand and complete the assignment to their best ability. Some teachers can tend to over estimate their students ability and knowledge of a subject, so only the students can truly know their own ability and know what will help them be able to understand the material the most. At the end of the day, the goal of the summer assignment is to keep students learning during their break and give them an introduction into what they will be learning about in their next school year. Allowing the students to design the projects will most likely achieve this goal better than if a teacher were to design it. For example, math is one of the subjects that students tend to struggle with the most, and giving them an assignment with material on it that they are unfamiliar with because it's something they will learn next school year is not beneficial, especially if they do not have a teacher with them to ask questions. If the student designs it, they will be able to take the topics given to them by their teachers and include links to websites such as Khan Academy to help themselves with it over the summer. Overall, students know what works best for them and they are the ones completing the work, so the least the school can do for them is allow them to design their own summer projects.

In conclusion, summer projects are beneficial to students in their preparation for the upcoming school year; however, giving the students the opportunity to design their projects will lead to more success over the teacher-designed projects. Students being more likely to complete something they designed, taking away the blame students would normally put on teachers, and students knowing their own ability and knowledge are three out of the many reasons why summer projects should be student-designed. Ultimately, it would be ideal for both students and teachers to work together on designing the projects so that the students know what the teacher is looking for and the teachers can understand what the students are able to do; however, the students should have more control of the projects because they are the ones completing the projects, and it is their future that is being affected. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
C66B1884100A,"A start to a new beginning. Last summer a group of friends and I, started a summer program. A program where kids can learn different things, different ways to do things, and of course have fun. We built things such as, wooden boats, wooden hats, and wooden cars. We showed them different ways to do project. For fun we took the kids swimming, hiking, and fishing. At the end my friends and I got great feedback from the kids and their parents. With my friends and I taking on such as big program like that, showed me that any child could do whatever they wanted to, if they put their mind to it. That is why I think it is a great idea for students to design; because, they could come up with fun things to do, could be able to show others what they are able to do without a teacher's help, and they would already know what people their age like to talk about and work on.

First, most students have great imaginations. That can cause them to come up with great, fun, and different things to do. Such as using 3D objects, using liquids, and maybe even using things from nature. Those different things can really get someone attention.

Second, there may be someone that is trying their best to show everyone what they can do. Designing a project can be great way to prove themselves. That way when they finish designing, they are able to show everyone. That student would be able to call themselves a great independent worker.

Third, when students are let out for the summer; they do not want to do thing involving school work. Having a student design the project can make sure it is on something that would make them want to work on something related to school. It will be something different for the kids. They will be doing something instructive, as their summer goes by.

In conclusion, student designed would be the best choice. Some people might say teacher design would be best but I disagree. I beg you to consider my opinion. ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
584318BAA12F,"School projects are required for students at certain schools to complete over the summer to prove that they are still learning over their break. The summer projects should be student designed, because they are not in school at the time. If the teachers want to assign a project to the students for a period that they are not enrolled in the school system, they can atleast throw the ball into the students court on where to take it from there. As long as the student sticks to the theme of the project. A project to show you're learning something like the one in this case, can be taken through many different routes.

Summer is a school vacation. When most schools let out for the break, they don't hold the students accountable for any school work. Unless say you were participating in home school, which would be a different story. Although this school inparticular has a different prespective by wanting the reassurance that their students are not brain-washed throughout the next couple months off. Assigning a simple tasks to show your teacher that you have really learned something, is not bad when student-designed, as long as kept within appropriate boundaries. When you get assigned something, with the choice to choose where you go from there, you will result in a better outcome. Learning something that you are curious, or excited about will give you a whole different experience. When something intrests you, you gain motivation.

If the teachers had chose to design a project for the students, it would most likley be a clique. Im thinking thick stacks of paper you have to read through, by following up questions and writting. There is already enough of that work in school. If that is what the school would be going for with the summer project, they might as well find a way to cancel summer out completely. Being a pupil myself I know that as soon as I walk out of those school doors, I'm free for the next couple months. If you throw a stack of paper work at me at that time, I'm most likley to hold off, or forget about it copletely. As for i had just got released from that type of routine. Throwing extreme school paperwork at me as soon as I get free from that, doesn't make the most sense. If thats the case, cancel out summer completely, because the tradition of summer is a school vacaction.

Say you simply hand the students a one sheet of paper stating that they need to come back into the next school year, exhibiting that they learned something intresting or new over the summer, you will get better outcome. Once you release the kids from the school, especially for summer you are not going to get the same energy out of most of them. If they are not enrolled at the time, the bottom line is that they really do not owe you anything. Giving pupils that freedom, then throwing what they are getting away from right back at them is not the way to go with this. Doing that, a lot of kids will have no desire nor care at all to complete that task. Summer is about chill and good vibes. Throw something simple but effective at the students, then you tell me if you achieve a good outcome in return .",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
978920CB10C6,"Nowadays, the image of summer vacation is something that is cemented into most children's minds from a fairly young age. It is a paradise of dripping ice cream cones, long nights without a bedtime, and freedom from the rules and regulations the school system imposes on them for nine long months. For students, summer often stands as an opportunity to explore the world on their own terms, rather than on their teachers' terms. In the eyes of many adults, however, this freedom is easily abused, leading to children choosing to sit in front of their televisions for three months. As they see it, children need the guidance and structure of the school system in order to continue learning. This can come in the form of required summer projects made to encourage students to continue learning outside of the classroom. While this can definitely achieve its goal, if the projects were to be determined by teachers, then they could actually discourage the intellectual curiosity of students.

Many students view the requirement to go to school as a prison sentence. Even though education is a tremendous privilege, the fact still remains that, in the eyes of many, school is not fun. For most people, it means being forced to learn about subjects they find boring and useless, while simultaneously following menial classroom rules. However, summer vacation serves as a glorious break from this oppressive rule. In those three months, many students feel an extreme sense of freedom to do as they please, regardless of what teachers have to say. Students spend nine months of each year under classroom rules, so why must it be extended into summer? Students will still be under the supervision of their parents, many of whom don't want their children wasting their summer. Individual parents are just as likely as teachers to take an active interest in the quality of their kids' summer activities, if not more so. If teachers were to design the required summer projects of their students, it would be a senseless extension of their rules into a time frame devoted to giving children a break from school rules.

Many adults assume that, if children are given this freedom, then they will ultimately waste their summers. This valid concern supports the argument to give students a summer project in the first place. However, if teachers genuinely wanted to incite intellectual curiosity in their students, then giving them the freedom to design their own projects would be ideal. Most children are naturally curious and have the innate desire to learn and explore. While the assignment to produce a project may seem like a chore at first, the freedom to design it themselves can motivate children to explore something they are interested in or delve deeper into their passions. Summer break is a time that is meant for students to discover more about themselves and the world around them outside of the classroom, and even if it is assigned by teachers, a project of their own design could encourage them to do just that. Once summer ends, this strengthened passion for learning can also help them in the classroom.

The natural curiosity that students express contradicts assumptions made by adults who, despite their best intentions, sometimes neglect to acknowledge the skills, wisdom, and other exemplary qualities displayed by children. Often, students internalize the assumptions adults make, leading them to believe that their opinions and interests do not matter as much as those of adults. However, giving students the freedom to define their own projects could serve to boost their confidence.

If teachers could trust that their students are intelligent and capable of learning on their own terms, then students would internalize those values and learn to trust themselves. Letting students explore what interests them sends the message that their interests and passions are important and worth sharing. This confidence encourages students to tell themselves that the things they do matter, which would help to encourage them to stick with their passions into adulthood. Even though the adults in a child's life are a vital source of guidance, they also have to push the child to develop the confidence needed to function without their help. Students should be given the freedom to choose what they want to learn and focus on over the summer so that they can develop the confidence to learn outside of the parameters of formal education.

Summer is an important motivator for students, reminding them of the eventual fruits of their academic labor and giving them something to look forward to throughout the year. Even if summer may not always be fun and games, it should still be something kids can look back on and remember fondly. Everyone knows that tasks tend to be more enjoyable and meaningful when a person can perform them on their own terms, and the same goes for summer projects required by teachers.

If students are given a project of their own design, then the project could become another happy memory for children, something they can look back on as adults to remind themselves that learning and exploration should always be approached with a smile. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
511D856B4842,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These summer projects should be student designed. Having students create their own summer project would be a new experience. It would be good opportunity for them to showcase their knowledge. it would demonstrate: cognitive thinking skills, creativity, and the knowledge acquired throughout the school year.

Having students design their own summer project would require cognitive thinking skills. Cognitive thinking skills are essential to designing a summer project because students must put their heads together to create a project they all agree on and enjoy. Students also have to think of what to incorporate into the project. It's important for students to cooperate and pitch in ideas for the project. Creating an assignment requires thinking like a teacher. Designing a project is difficult but can be accomplished if students set their minds to it and focus on the task at hand. All these things require a higher level of thinking.

Creating a summer project would spark student creativity. Most of the time during school, students do not use their creativity but the chance to create their own project would encourage them to be creative. Since the students are the ones creating the project, they most likely want a project that is fun and enticing. Coming up with ways to make school work fun can be difficult but it's possible. In order to design a fun summer project, one must be creative and think outside the box to create a project everyone enjoys.

Allowing students to design their own summer project would their knowledge of everything learned throughout the school year. It would put their knowledge to the test to see how much information was actually retained. It would also give students an idea of how what was learned in class will be used in their daily lives.

In conclusion letting students design their own projects would be a wonderful opportunity for them. It would make them use cognitive thinking, creativity, and showcase their knowledge. It will be a new experience that would teach them valuable lessons. It will also teach them skills needed in everyday life. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
9E226661A907,"School is a place that educates individuals and allows them to grow as a person through knowledge provided by teachers. Teachers are more knowledgeable others who follow a certain rule set to get students to graduate to the next level of knowledge. These teachers mainly know better than students and help students grow as people guiding them to a better life. Teachers know more than the students about life through their experiences, so the students should listen and do what their teachers tell them to do such as a project over summer break. The Summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers can correctly guide their students to be ready for their next level of education through their knowledge and experiences through college training for their own profession.

The Summer projects should be designed by teachers because they are correctly guiding them, so they are ready for the next level of education. Teachers are people who like to help others and put the students on the correct path, so they can lead a good life with knowledge. Teachers genuinely are also nice people who mean no harm to anyone because their career choice deals with helping students everyday, so they will not lead their students on bad paths. Instead, the teachers will make sure the students are prepared for most things that will come at them in life and even if the students don't like the Summer projects in the end the teachers were looking out for them. Due to the teachers kind nature of helping others they will keep their students on the right path through the Summer projects that allow the students to retain the information they learned in the year.

Teachers are trained and educated in college to bestow knowledge on students and normal people who don't have the type of knowledge they do. Throughout the school year the teachers are becoming more familiar with their students adapting to the best type of learning they can to educate their students. By the end of the year the teachers are more familiar with the student's learning style, so they can set them up with a project that will help them retain the knowledge to be prepared for next year. Through their experiences the teachers know what is best for the students they are teaching, so it is more within reason for the teachers to design the projects.

Some may say that the student designed projects would be better, but this is incorrect because students are known to be lazy during the Summer. The students would design a project that does not benefit them in their education because they want to be free and do whatever they want to do during the Summer. The teachers on the other hand would prepare them with good intellectual projects that help the students retain the knowledge. So, it is in everyone's best interest that the teachers design the projects to help the students.

Teachers are kind, valuable, and educated individuals who are here to help their students succeed in life and their school career. Through their knowledge and experiences in college teachers can correctly guide their students to be successful individuals that flourish in the world around them by retaining knowledge throughout their school years. Whether it seems like it or not in the student's eyes the Summer projects designed by teachers are there to help them succeed. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
02FDCCA0C7D2,"Why Students Need to Design Their Own Projects

Projects are a great way to engage students into a topic, if a student picks a topic that they want, then their project will be a reflection of their own excellence. Student-designed projects are more than just projects, they are experiences and lessons that you simply can not obtain in any other way. Schools should allow their students to lead their own summer projects because the students will be more interested in the topics, they will learn more about the topics, and they will produce a better end product.

Schools should allow students to design their own projects, so that the students will take more interest in those topics. Students need to feel like they had some control in choosing their own topic in order to feel more connected to the project. It is important that students feels connected to the project, so that they will dig deeper into them and work harder on them. When students are interested in their topics, they are connected to them; however, when students are not interested, then they fail to engage in their topic. When I was in ninth grade, I was assigned a summer project where I had to research the invasive species of plants that could be found in my neighborhood. I was not given a choice on my project. I had to research invasive plant species, so I struggled to complete my project because it was so uninteresting to me. I resented the research and the fact that I had no freedom about how to create my project. Despite my miserable efforts to finish the project, I did not complete it. I had not engaged myself in the project, which resulted in me getting a low grade. Because I wasn't interested in my topic, I failed to be successful in the creation of my project. In most cases, the quality of work is based on how interested the student is. The student needs to be engaged and interested in a topic in order to perform their highest.

Schools should allow students to design their own projects in order for the students to gain more knowledge about their topic. Students who are given a choice of topic will search further into their topic and develop a larger understanding than students who are forced into a topic. When I was given a choice to research anything about my county, I developed a deeper understanding of my topic along with a truly unique experience. I was given a choice to research anything my county, so I choose the history of my favorite natural park. I did extensive research and I even went to the park's small history museum where I talked to a couple local historians about it. My experience was phenomenal because I was engaged in my topic, and I got to meet with extraordinary people and learn facts that fascinated me. It was an amazing and truly eye-opening experience where I learned things about my county that I would have never imagined. I was given choice and freedom, so I capitalized on them and fully engaged and educated not only myself, but my teachers and peers. Students given freedom and options will expand on their own ideas resulting in better projects. Not will those students educate themselves, but they will educate others as well. Students experience a deeper understanding after they engage themselves in an area that they are interested and excited about and they can also build relationships and bonds when they choose their own direction.

Schools should allow students to lead their own projects so that the students produce better end results. Students who choose their own topic will do an overall more thorough and precise job on their work. When students create their own projects, then they will strive for an excellent end result. Students who are able to choose their own project will strive for a perfect end result because they know that it came fully from themselves, not anyone else's input. The reason behind this notion is the concept that creators need to feel like they created something exceptional. If I am given freedom for a project, then I will try my best to make sure that my project is not less than outstanding. I work my hardest when I get to choose my own topic because it is now more personal and important to me. Students who create their own projects will not be satisfied with just anything, when creating the project, they will try to make their final work flawless.

When given the freedom to design their own summer projects, students will be more interested in the topics, they will gain more knowledge, and they will produce a superb end product. If students are given the freedom of choice, then they will fully engage themselves and gain a deeper knowledge and a more personalized experience then if they were just forced into a specific topic. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
5F02CAE49707,"Some schools require students to complete A summer project to assure they continue learning during their break. Should it be teacher-designed or student designed. I think it should be student-designed. One reason why i think it should be student designed is because more students will do it. Second reason is that a lot more of the students would have more to talk about.

One of my reason why i think it should be student designed is because it would get done by more of the students. when teachers ask you to do school work in the summer some students will forget and some will not even try but If the student could pick what kind of project they wanted to do more students would be interested.

My second reason is that if it was picked by the students they have more to talk about. Like they could pick something that is interesting to them. They wouldnt have to just think about school it could be about a lot more of stuff like sports,games,special events and a lot more stuff. It would be more special and a lot of the students would be creative and they could help each other with it.

6D1FB567121E,"Summer break is meant to give kids a break from school and the constant teacher-chosen workload. Summer projects should be student-designed because they will allow kids to show their creativity. Being forced to create boring and dull projects is very demoralizing and will make a student feel trapped. to contrast, when students can design their own projects it will be more fun and it will let students think for themselves. Additionally, having student-designed projects will boost the amount of kids who complete the projects.

To start, student-designed projects should be given to students because they let students creativity shine. Creativity is an important part of every child's life, not being able to use it will make a child dull. For example, when someone does not practice or use something they often lose their ability to do it. Additionally, student-designed projects would let students show who they really are and what they enjoy. When students can show who they really are they feel happy and good about themselves. Also, when they can express what they enjoy they will attract other classmates that enjoy the same thing. Having friends that enjoy the same thing they do will not only improve their happiness but will also improve their work ethic towards what they enjoy. For example, I am in very demanding and somewhat difficult classes. Having friends in the same classes as me with the same goals makes it a lot easier. Without them I would most likely not work nearly as hard.

To add, student-designed projects should be given to students because they will increase the amount of kids that will complete the project. When students are forced to complete something they do not enjoy some people just will not do it. If students enjoy the project and look forward to it many more will complete it. For example, I have been assigned many projects during my life. When a teacher gives the students more than one way they can do the project it always has more submissions than if it was only an essay. Specifically, after reading a book, my class had to do a final report. When the teacher gave us options such as a: poster, essay, picture, or model it had many submissions.

To contrast, many people would say that having student-designed projects would allow students to not work as hard as they would if they had teacher-designed projects. What they did not consider is that it is summer break and that most students would not be working hard anyways. To add, having student-designed projects would allow the students to be more enthusiastic about the project and work harder. If you expect students to work hard during summer why even have a summer break? It does not make any sense to give students a break that they still need to work during.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because they will allow kids to show their creativity, and they will increase the amount of students who complete them. Giving students something they can choose will ultimately increase students work ethic and view of school.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
082E19093947,"Would you enjoy your summer if you were required to do some project that didn't intrest you? A project based off of something not to your liking or one that is so boring it would put you to sleep? Here's why students should be allowed to come up with their own school project to make sure they continue learning over summer. Students would be more likely to want to continue learning by doing their own designed project because they will do it on a subject they want to know more about and intrested in, the project would be more likely done if choosen by them, and it wont feel as required if its student choosen.

Some people might think it should be teacher based but some students wouldnt like the topic or the teacher would want them to include certain things students might not know how to do or would like to include in their project. This will also give them less freedom of choosing there style of project. Teacher based projects would also be more educational based off of things they teach and wouldnt intrest students and it would be msot likely not turned in by the end of summer.

Students would do a project on a topic they want to know more about and intrested in. If the project were to be teacher based, most students wouldn't be intrested in it, therefore, some students wouldn't want to do the project and will have the lack of wanting to learn about something that doesn't intrest them and make it a chore. Making a student choose a topic for their project would, make them choose something they're intrested in and they will most likely have a project ready to turn in at the end of summer. Student would also complete the project with more detail instead of not having any at all. All the projects would be different subject and more unique letting students choose so teachers can make sure students learned.

Some students have summer jobs or go travel to different location's. When student's are given the choice of choosing their own school project they will have less of a chance of forgetting that they have to do one or forgetting what they have learned about. This will also give them a chance on choosing what style of what of project they want. They could do it on paper or poster or power point and many more. Students coud also base it off of the schedule they have or the days that are free.

In conclusion, Student based projects would be more likely done then teacher based projects. Students would do them off of things they are interested in and subjects that catch their attention. They will do it around there time frame and in any style they want. doing it student based will have students educate them selves about things they enjoy and love to do on daily bases and teachers will have something turned in to them by the end of summer.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
9DF649C711A9,"Imagine you are relaxing on the beach, enjoying a wonderful vacation with your family and friends. When suddenly, your music is interrupted by an email from your Spanish teacher that your summer assignment is due at 12:00 am. You had completely forgotten about your summer assignment and need to quickly hurry to get it done before the deadline. Although some say student-designed summer projects are better and easier, actually teacher-designed summer projects are far more superior.

It can be clearly said that students have full capacity to design their own projects and make sure it does not over-exceed their limits. Students designing their own projects can allow them to make sure it does not affect their daily live and that will entice them to actually do the project. For example, when teachers assign a project, it can feel as though the teacher is being inconsiderate because they might have given them a difficult project. Another example is the fact that the teacher's design might not be comprehensible to the student and could be too vague or too complicated for the student to understand.

The reason I believe summer assignments should be designed by teachers is because of the structure and perfect context. I do believe students are capable of designing projects themselves, however, students sometimes lack the ability to give enough context in anything they design. Teachers always design a project or assignment that can be completed by anyone and that it should not overwork the students. Teachers have the ability to include more context and give an ideal project to any student. For example, teachers give full and proper directions when introducing the project and can always explain the context behind what they are asking the student for. Another example would be the fact that teacher always make it simpler than it really should be for the student to complete the project they are given.

In addition to support my argument, teachers have no control over the students time management skills. As I stated before, teachers make the projects fitted to accommodate every students schedule. Not to mention the fact that they also would like to enjoy their summer and are well aware that their students would rather have nothing interfere with their summer activities. Teachers do not assign projects for fun, but they assign them because of the fact that they want their students to remember at least something they did in a classroom. For example, teachers never assign anything during the summer that can't be done in less than ten minutes . Another example would be that teachers take time out of their day to compose an email or a reminder of some sort to let the student know that their project is due soon.

In conclusion, whether it is the student that cannot manage their time properly or the teachers inability to fully explain in context what students need in their project, I still believe it is best to have teacher-designed summer projects. Although some believe it is best for students to design their projects, actually having teachers design projects is better.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

In life you are pushed to improve from day to day why not work in the summer to help better your learning ability. Summer projects should be made by the teachers. Students know less about assigning projects then teachers. Teachers would make the project more reasonable, it wouldn't be a project that has no meaning, and they would make it fun for the students. Teachers are taught to assign students projects they had to go to school for a long time to be able to teach. The most i've seen a teacher assign for a summer project is just reading a book. Firstly teachers would assign projects with meaning.

Teachers would try their best to make a project meaningful for the summer. They will take time and make sure the projects helps them improve students learning abilities. Students would just assign a project that is like draw a picture or do five math problems for the whole summer. Just so they don't have to do work in the summer because they think have better things to do then learn. Although it will be extra work for the teachers I dont' think they would mind making their school better by improving the abilities of students. Other people may say it's a bad idea. Studies say having year round school or even summer work will improve test scores and makes kids work harder. Summer work is a great idea. Secondly assigning a project with no meaning wouldn't help the students improve.

If all teachers made up projects for students during summer it will help them to improve, but they will have some sort of meaning even if its just reading a book. Studies show that thirty minutes of reading a day will improve your vocabulary and your writing ability. Many students don't like to read because they think it is boring. From personal experiences reading is really fun and has helped me improve in many ways. I've only been reading for about nine weeks five days a week and i can see the improvements already. Reading is the perfect project you can take a book anywhere like: on the beach, in the car, on a plane, and on a boat. Reading will also make you have less screen time during the summer. Last, teachers would make projects enjoyable for kids.

Teaches go to college for many years to be able to teach. Each teacher has a different style from one another. Most teachers has this sort of charm to them that makes them entertaining for students. Thats why Teachers should make the summer projects. Teachers have a way of working with kids to make them happy or to make them have fun. Teachers should make the projects for the summer work.

Many people see summer work as a chore. Summer work can really help you but a teacher should be the one assigning it. Teachers would assign something meaningful, something that had meaning, and teachers go to college for many years. Teachers should be he only one assigning work.

06BC6DAE198F,"Many school require students to attend summer projects to help them continue to grow and learn during the summer. In these summer projects they should be student-designed, so that students can select the ways they learn best. Another reason may include, that many students do not like attending projects that do not seem exciting. Also when students accomplish something its increases the chances of them wanting to learn. In conclusion student-designed projects helps increase students wanting to learn.

Many students have different ways to learn, so when students design the ways they learn it makes learning a lot easier for them. For example if I learn visually I would want to design a class or a project that they are watching how to do something, and them attempting it. Another way to learn is hands on, so I would want to create a projects where I have to use my hands. There are many different ways that students learn, and the only person who knows how they learn is themselves.

Students do not like attending events where they do not have fun. So, when you set students in a classroom all day they tend to get tired and even bored. So, when students design what they want to do, they are choosing a way to learn and have fun. For example games that people can play are math games, for every math worksheet they complete they have a certain amount of time to swim, or some reward to let them know that they are doing well. They can go on hiking trips, and learn types of trees and get the experience of seeing new things.

When someone gets a sense of accomplishment it makes them want to keep pushing, so when students get the sense of accomplishment from designing this summer program it will make them want to attend, learn, and have fun. Just from getting the sense of accomplishment many student can find out what they want to do with the rest of their lives. Many students when they feel that they did not accomplish anything, it will make them not want to do anything. In summary accomplishment for some people can help them know who they are and who they want to become.

When students take on their own tasks it help them want to keep pushing and continue to learn. With all of the experience that they will receive it will help them grow as people not just as a student. From students figuring how they learn to just having fun they will help some student with the rest of their lives, all from what they learned at a required summer project. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
3CA5A09CDC38,"Summer is here! Students and teachers are out of school; they are on vacations, visting family, or being with friends! But what about retaining information from the past year, or learning new information, all while you are doing all of your favorite summer activities? Some schools require summer projects during the summer break so that students have an oppurtunity to continue learning over the summer. The summer projects that are completed by students should be student-designed because, it lallows for the student to be more creative and have fun!

When given the oppurtunity to do a project, students are more likely to complete a project that is based on their creativity. For example, if the student is on an international vacation and left with very little supplies, that student will be forced to be resourceful with his/her resources. With that being said, instead of making the projects teacher-designed, and risking a less creative and boring project, the projects should be student-designed. This will allow the students to come up with their own way of presenting their newly found information through their own creativity with his/her resources.

Student-designed projects give the oppurtunity to make learning fun! A student who is researching information should have a good time while learning the neccessary information to complete to school-required project. For example, if the student is on vacation at a beach, researching information about the ocean, they might go to the beach and explore the natures (all while enjoying their vacation)! The student will not have to stress about finishing their summer project when they get back from their vacation.

Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Some might believe that teachers should design the projects so they are more structured and relevent to what they are trying to teach. But, making these projects student-designed, it would make the project more enjoyable for the student, allowing them to be more creative, and have fun! ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
5C680F1815BD,"It is well known that various classes assign summer homework to students to ensure that learning takes place over the course of their break. However, it has been debated whether it is more beneficial for either students or teachers to design these summer projects. Although students can design these assignments to cater to their differing schedules on a more personal level, teachers are more qualified to design these projects. Students lack the maturity and education level that is needed to create an assignment that brings forth the most successful results, whereas teachers have the capability of designing projects to meet the standards needed to pass that specific class.

To become a teacher, one must pursue a higher education and obtain a valid degree. Teachers are essentially trained to create thought provoking assignments that challenge students just enough to elicit the most successful results. If the assignment is too difficult, then students would not be able to complete it. If the assignment is too easy, then students wouldn't be learning. As a teenager myself, I know that neither I or my peers have received any type of training in how to effectively teach someone. Teachers, on the other hand, are more knowledgeable in what are the most efficient manners in helping someone learn information. Because of this, they are more credible in creating assignments that will be beneficial to students and ensure that learning takes place over summer.

It is a well known fact that teenagers brains are not fully developed yet, which explains why they are known to make impulsive, sometimes detrimental, decisions. Their behavior is unreliable, and as a result, they are prohibited from doing certain activities until they reach a certain age, such as driving or drinking. They simply lack maturity compared to adults.

With this lack of maturity, students are more likely to abuse this opportunity and ""take the easy way out"" when designing their assignments. As a result, they won't design a project that is beneficial to their learning, which in turn defeats the whole purpose of summer assignments. In this sense, teachers are more reliable then students since they are more mature , and are able to design an assignment that makes sure learning takes place over the summer.

Typically, students are not as well informed on these various given subjects compared to teachers. As mentioned earlier, teachers receive a higher education to become more knowledgeable on the material they teach. They can spend years mastering their subject to become qualified enough to help others learn the particular material they studied. Students on the other hand don't have nearly as much experience in these given subjects. With this lack of education, it's difficult for children to create a summer project that covers everything they should review over the summer. How will they be able to design their project when they aren't efficiently informed on what the course is? Teachers provide more knowledge and experience needed to design the most beneficial project that will help their students, and therefore, should be the people in charge of creating these assignments.

All in all, teachers are simply more qualified to design summer homework assignments compared to students. They are more knowledgeable on the subject they are teaching, they are better informed in the best methods to help someone learn, and they know how to create an assignments that elicits successful learning. To have teachers design these assignments is more beneficial to making sure students learn over the summer, which in the end, is the goal of summer homework.  ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
6E59CC205803,"Over the summer, teachers often assign summer projects to ensure that students are still learning during their break. Usually, these projects are challenging and time-consuming, making students dread them. Occasionally, students will get to choose what they want to do for their summer projects, making them seem less like school work. Although some people say that summer projects should be teacher-designed because they would be more challenging, summer projects should be student-designed because they would showcase a student's individual interests, they would be more enjoyable, and they would show an increase in the effort level of students.

To begin with, summer projects should be student-designed because they would showcase a student's individual interests. Student-designed projects would allow students to not only choose the topic of their project, but also their method of presentation. This would mean that each student's project would be entirely different. For example, Generic_Name may choose to do a PowerPoint presentation on lacrosse, while Generic_Name may choose to write a speech on global warming. Students would be able to be more creative and complete projects that truly showcase who they are and what interests them. Each student's interests would be highlighted and the projects would allow teachers to learn more about each student personally before the start of a new school year. Along with allowing students to be more creative and allowing teachers to learn more about their students, student-designed projects would also be more fun for teachers to grade. Rather than having to grade different papers about the same topic over and over again, teachers would get to see a variety of topics and ideas, making grading more enjoyable for them. For example, if a teacher-designed summer project were to ask students to write a paper on whether dogs or cats make better pets, grading would become very boring. However if students were allowed to choose their own topic, showcasing their individual interests, grading would become more exciting for teachers. Student-designed summer projects should be encouraged because they would highlight each student's interests.

Secondly, summer projects should be student-designed because they would be more enjoyable. By allowing students to choose their own project, teachers would be making summer projects seem less like school work. If a students were to choose their own project, they would be able to choose something that interests them rather than something that they do not care about, allowing the project to become more enjoyable. For example, if Generic_Name were to choose her own topic for her summer English project, she would likely choose volleyball. But if her English teacher were to choose the topic for her project, Generic_Name could end up writing about lizards, a topic that she shows no interest in, making the project dreadful. If teachers were to allow students to design their own projects, students could choose a topic that they are truly interested in, making summer projects more fun.

Lastly, summer projects should be student-designed because they would show an increase in the effort level of students. Students would become more motivated to work on their projects if they were able to choose what type of project they got to complete. In addition, students would put more effort into their projects because they may not know how the teacher is going to grade them. For example, if teachers were to design summer projects then students would likely have an understanding of what the teacher expects and how they will be grading the project. In contrast with teacher-designed projects, student-designed projects would allow students to have more uncertainty as to how the teacher will be grading. Worried about their grades, students would try to supply the teacher with their best work and put more time and energy into their project. Teachers should support the idea of student-designed summer projects so that they get the most effort out of their students.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because they would showcase a student's individual interests, they would be more enjoyable, and they would show an increase in the effort level of students. If summer projects were student-designed, then students and teachers would have a stronger relationship throughout the remainder of the school year. School systems and teachers should consider assigning student-designed projects over the summer. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
4BD30FA12457,"Some believe that it should be teacher designed, but others say it should be student designed to benefit them and make the summer project less difficult for the students. Their are many more other opinion since most parents believes that students should not have a summer project since it will stress and pressure them too much over brake. Another reason is to allow the students to take a brake since summer brake is meant fro the students to relax. Some students need to go out of state for family or other reason to enjoy the time they have before starting the learning process again the following year and this will allow students to think of what they will do different in school compared to last year. If the school does decide to remove summer project it will also help the teachers out so they have less work and more time to prepare for next year enrolling students.

Their are many benefits to having the summer project and it being teacher designed since most students do almost all school work teacher designed so the students have some experience. Students also have more time to complete the summer project since they don't have classes or work during their brake. The students environment will be great for the students with the hot weather, great light, and more day time. They could also communicate with one another to talk about the summer project since they are not in a school zone so they are not restricted from using any cellular devices. With the summer project being teacher designed the students could email the teacher if they are having a difficult task finishing the project so the teachers feedback will be a great help to any struggling students that need some assistance.

Some students do benefit from the summer project but others don't even have the time to even complete the project at all. Certain students need to go out of the country to see family. Others start to get a summer job to save up money or for some other personal reason. They could get to lazy since they don't have any classes in the summer than they push it to the side or they do it the last week it is due. Students could also forget about the project over the brake.

Summer project could be a great way for students academically but is it gonna benefit them in the long run as they choose their own path. A majority of schools in the U.S don't even have summer projects for students to do over brake. Most colleges don't even look or seem interested if you done summer projects your entire school year. Even if the project is either teacher or student designed it won't really help the students after school. Future courses may not even need you do have a summer project done as a requirement to enroll into any courses.

In conclusion the summer project should be teacher designed for the students to make it easier to complete. Having it teacher based makes it more familiar to the students and more understanding. The summer project should be something optional not a requirement for any school. If the summer project was student based than some students may not try up to their own potential. Teachers are less stress over the summer with less work with the summer project and they can focus on future enrolling students.        ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
B6D345D45CB9,"During the school year, school work assigned by teachers can be exhausting for the students, and create a weight that can drag a student's well being down like a sinking ship.

Many students around the world simply receive assignments from teachers without having a say in how they learn the information.

Students should at least be able to choose how they learn information over the summer in order to get a break from the stress associated with teacher-assigned work.

This will help students learn at their own pace, Learn more about their interests, and also potentially find a career that they're happy with, along with gaining independence.

Allowing students work at their own pace could not only allow them to learn more, but could also alleviate a good portion of stress associated with teacher-assigned projects.

For example, doing research the student's own way rather than following a specific rubric would make the project less specific, allowing the student to create a product that is more their own.

Doing this could also allow students to be more creative and have fun with what they're learning about.

This will change their attitude towards learning new material, and allow them to approach learning with a positive attitude in future school years.

Many students have specific interests for what they want to do as a profession.

If they can choose a project that they're interested in, it can allow them to further pursue their passion.

This could potentially lead them to a college scholarship, and eventually a successful career.

For example, for Generic_Name who is interested in geology, but doesn't have the resources to explore, giving them the opportunity to create a project could be a huge benefactor for helping them learn more, as well as giving them potential college opportunities.

However, many teachers believe that giving students a topic and guidelines to work with could help their research skills and benefit them for future projects.

This may be true, but having students work on a project about a topic they're not interested in doesn't do them any good in the long run.

You can't force a person to like a certain topic.

Letting them choose their own project creates more motivation to do the research, as well as present a cleaner finish product.

In conclusion, giving students the opportunity to create their own project could lead to an abundance of paths going forwards.

It could allow them to expand their knowledge of a topic of interest, creating an option for a major in college.

It also allows students to learn and conduct research at a comfortable pace, allowing them to enjoy what they're learning about, as well as form a product that resonates their personality and vibe.

Lastly, it gives them an opportunity for independence, which will prepare them for other challenges in the real world.               ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
EBCABB635458,"Many schools in the country today require that their students complete summer projects, they do this under the notion that these ( teacher designed ) projects will enssure that the students' education will be furthered during their designated breaks. Although this is true in the sense that the students will be focused over the break and will be furthering their education, it is false in the sense that a teacher designed project will help students. If the students were able to design their own projects for summer then, they would be less stressed upon their arrival at school the following year, and the students would be able to have a chance to be creative.

The mental health crisis is at the forefront of many schools' agendas, today the mental health of many teens has plummeted to all-time lows. There is one common factor in the mental health crisis, stress. Stress plays a large role in daily life and some people view it as a tool that can be used by people to grow, but for many stress has the adverse affect of overwhelming students and causing them to do things they otherwise would not do; For example this can be seen in the sudden surge of school shootings, bomb threats, and fights. The world notices the effects that such large workloads over prolonged periods can have on teens, that is why now, although there is almost no need for a break as there was in the 1800's, many still advocate for them. Breaks are seen as necessary de-stressers for people, especially teenagers. Teachers, although wanting the best for their students, often misjudge the amount of work and the difficulty levels associated with teacher designed summer assignments. If students were able to create their own assignments then they could spend less time stressing over what ( a teacher they do not know) wants as well as how they can complete the assignment, and they could focus more on a topic that intrests them and that they can complete in their own timely manner. Teacher designed projects often give students much anxiety and cause great stress to the student during their supposed ""break"" from school, a student designed project however, would allow for the students to pick a topic that will not stress them out and that they can complete making the students altoghether less stressed upon their arrival at school after the break. For example, this past summer I had 2 teacher designed projects to complete over the summer and I was taking a class already, this caused me great stress as I was not completely sure of what the two teachers wanted, as well as the fact that I was exhausted upon my arrival at school the following year.

In the real-world creativity is something that is in demand, many adults were not taught to be creative at a young age, which is why a student designed project is so important. A student designed project would give the students an opportunity that many adults never had at exploring their creative side. In many schools today creativity is not often emphasised, although this is true, the real-world strives for creativity, and not allowing the students grow as people by exploring topics that interest them and letting them create things would be a disservice to not only them, but society as a whole. For example, many students nowadays spend more time searching for the answers online to the excessive amount of dreadfully bland work assigned to them, then they do in actually completing the assignment themselves. another example would be that many students have a capacity for creativity and that the world will only progress as long as the future people who will run it are creative, and have the ability to think outside the box, for a few this skill comes naturally, but for many it is learned. Schools need prepare the youth of today for the future that is quickly approaching, there are many problems that must be fixed and can only be fixed by creative thinkers. Everything a person does, their actions, their thoughts, their speech, is all derived from the classroom; With that in mind, the importance of a student designed assignment (although miniscule) is detrimental to the future successes of society.

Some people claim that students will take advantage of a student designed project and use it as an excuse to do little to no work at all. This argument, although enticing, is false, due to the fact that a student will gain more knowledge of a topic if it is of their choosing, instead of doing what many do now, which is simply going online and searching for the answers. A student can learn almost nothing except how to efffectively cheat from a teacher designed project. I know from personal experience that I learned much more from a student designed project then a teacher designed project, mainly because I was more interested in the topic that I had chosen than i was in the topic of the teacher designed project. Also if a teacher does worry about students taking advantage of the student designed project option, then they can create a set of vague (topic wise) yet direct (requirement wise) guidelines for the student to follow, which would also help with grading of said student assignments.

Whereas the topic of student designed projects versus teacher designed projects can be seen as somewhat trivial, it infact is anything but that. There is a clear choice in how schools and teachers should proceed with summer assignments, and that is having them be student designed. Allowing students to design their own projects has many more positive factors than negative. With the assignment of said student designed projects, the students will not only be less stressed (which slows the common trend of violence and poor mental health), but they will have the opportunity to be creative and effectively grow as person, and in doing so, could become the future leaders of tomorrow. Allowing students to complete self designed projects would be extremely benficial to students worldwide. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
E05ACF2DFCB8,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break . Should these summer projects be teacher designed or student designed ? These choices should be up to the students designe . If the student picks they will be more willing to do it . Much rather if the teacher designed the project for the students . They will learn more picking their own designe and enjoy it more if it is their own design . Some kids also may be limited when it comes to acess and supplies and might not be able to get ahold of the supplies they need for the project or things they will need for the project their teacher designed.

With having students designe their own projects instead of the teacher will make the project more enjoyable. Some students will dilike what their teacher has provided them with . This being said it wont be enjoyable and will most likley they wont do it or wont learn anything because they wont be doing it or paying attention to what they are doing. If they dont do it or pay attention to it they wont get the learning experience the teachers want and with it being summer time they will probaly dislike their summer as well. If they dont learn anything there was no point of giving them the project . It should be enjoyable for them so they can have a fun leanring experiance and also have something fun to do over the summer and it being their choice it might make things extra fun for them . If they get to pick it they will proably be happy to be told they have a project to do over the summer and it being vacation they could also come up with something alot more funnier and a better learning experiance then a teacher could.

If the teacher designes the project the students may or may not have supplies for that project . They might not have it because they arent at home or on vacation because its summer time or maybe just might not be able to afford the supplies needed for the project. If the student can designe their project for them selfs they will most likly pick a project they can afford the supplies for or can get . Also saying the fact its summer time you could pick a project to challge yourself because you might be in a diffrent place . Some projects the students could designe could be no money for them at alll and still a good learning experience that was fun for them and not having to pay any money could help out the students who cant afford a project a teacher may have designed .

For example some parents and teachers say alllowing the students to design their own project is care less and they will make horrible choices. However allowing students to design their own projects will allow them to challege themselfes . They will also probley pick a project that is enjoybal to them and will make the learning experiance so much better and the students will most likely complte a project they ejoy doing. Also allowing students to design their own project wont make them be careless it will allow them to make adult choices on their own . This being said will show how much they are growing up and how they can make good choices on their own and how they can do it by themselfs . Allowing them to pick it will mostlikly make them make better choices much rather then carless ones .

The design of what project the students are given in the summer should completly be their own design not the teachers. If the students design their own projects they will mostlikley do something they like . If they do something that they like they will get it done and the learning experiance will be so much better then if the teacher designed what the students where told to do over the summer . It being said if the students where able to design the project they would enjoy it and be able to get all supplies they need for it because the teacher might pick something the student might not like or something they cant get supplies for. They would also probaly love to be told they have a project to do over the summer if it was their design and get it done. So overall students should be allowed to design their own projects so they can learn more in the summer. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
2F95EA7A9F3B,"Throughout the school year, ""You guys should have learned this last year"" is a common phrase heard from all teachers.

Students every year come into the new school year not knowing or remembering any of the prior information they had digested the previous year.

This can be extremely difficult, not just for the students, but for the teachers who have to reteach the information that the students already learned.

In order to prevent this, teachers issue summer projects to keep the students' minds ripe and ready to learn.

The real question is if these projects requirements should be dictated by the teachers or the students.

Teacher-designed projects would work best because they would be more challenging to the students, they would be able to learn something new, and teachers can design the project so that students are starting out with the sufficient amount of information that they need going into the new school year.

The issue with a student designing their own summer project is that it will most likely lack creativity or maximum use of their intelligence to complete.

They might just end up picking an easy topic just so they could get a good grade and move on with their summer.

While students should use the summer as a break from school, if a summer assignment is assigned, than it should be designed with the student's intelligence in mind.

Teacher-designed projects would insure that students use their intelligence to the fullest.

The topic would be more ""brain teasing"" and students would have to use their full effort rather than half doing it.

This would ensure that students don't slack off or attempt to take the easy way out of their assignment.

Students could also learn something that they never knew about before during their summer break.

Rather than doing a project on something that they already have knowledge of, they could learn new information that could prepare them for the next school year.

This would push the student out of their circle of knowledge, forcing them to take in new information.

Or they could learn the same information, just expanded upon.

It's like how in elementary school, students just learned the basics of history and geography, but going into middle school and high school, the information learned is way more in depth and extremely detailed.

Students could be interested by how much more their is to the subject than just the basics.

In theory, it could become more ""fun"" for the student to learn about.

In correlation with students having teacher-designed projects, the requirements to the projects can ensure that students learn the necessary amount of information they need to start off in the new school year.

If a project is designed to cater towards the necessary knowledge needed, they'll know about the subject rather than having to relearn everything from last year in order to catch up.

Doing teacher designed projects during the break ensures that students will go into the new year having some semblance of knowledge on the subject, rather than knowing nothing at all.

Through a teacher-designed project, students will know what they need to know in preparation for the next school year.

It's good for a student to have the baseline of what they need to know so that they won't go into the school year knowing absolutely nothing.

Teacher-designed projects are the best way to go.

While it would be nice to encourage students to use their own creativity in coming up with their own project, most would half do the project just so they could enjoy their breaks.

With a teacher-designed project, the student's focus would be on doing the project well.

Teacher-designed projects are the better option because they would challenge a student's intelligence, they could learn new information that they've never known before, and teachers could design the project so as to better prepare their students for the new school year.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
A588F05DC41F,"Would you want summer to be filled to the brim with boring assigments made by your teacher instead of enjoying some of your only time off school? If teachers were to construct summer projects they wouldn't be fun at all. Summer vacation is something to get excited for, not to dread. The teachers' projects would create anxiety for many but letting the students take the wheel could be interesting. The students could think of projects to not only work their minds while on break, but also to enjoy and appreciate what they've done.

Teachers have a hard time giving work that is both challenging and rewarding. If they make a fun assignment, it must be easy. This is true for the opposite: If the make a challenging assignment it's garenteed to be boring. If they let the students make the summer projects they might find a perfect blend of the two. They would make something that requires skill and also happens to be exciting to do.

The taachers' projects would for a fact bring anxiety and depression for a magority of people becasue summer is a time for them to relax and regroup. Some teachers may not understand this concept or try to pass it off as no big deal. Students know what it's like so they could create projects that don't feel overwelming or unfair. It could be a compremise between the students and the teachers to get done the things they need to.

Over the course of summer, the projects might be forgotten if the teachers were to make them because no one enjoys them. To ensure that the projects don't get lost, students would have to think of ideas that would make the projects a blast to get though. Ideas like travelling the world and recording the experience could be trilling and get the gears turning in the students brains.

In the end, leaving it to the student population of the school to make the projects would keep these projects enjoyable, challenging, and overall painless. This project would be like ripping off a bandage really quick to get it done without pain and have fun the rest of break. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
862995E50ECE,"Summer, a time of joy, warmth, traveling, and making memories. Students and teachers count down the days til the end of the school year, and the start of their favorite time of year. There is a mutual appreciation from the students and teachers, they can have a break from their everyday jobs! Students are burned out from school during the summer time, they live freely without their normal load of stress carried on their shoulders. Although this is a wonderful time, responsibilities are still present. Education still needs to progress, even through the fun. Summer projects should be student-designed, so the creativity, and excitement of completing the project is still present.

Students want freedom, they want to be able to get cut loose from a teacher's tight grip on a curriculum, and a summer project is the perfect way to give the students what they want. This can create an adventure for the student, and give an opportunity for the student to learn something on their own. As a student myself, my least favorite projects are ones where everybody is doing the same thing, there is a strict rubric, and there is a sense of the teachers way, or NO way. In high school, students feel like they are less respected and seen as elementary students if they are put under such strict guidelines. Students do not get excited for a project they do not care about it, or have any personal connection to it. By giving a loose project topic, the students have the ability to take what you provided for them, and run with the idea independently. This creates a bigger sense of ownership of the project, and something they can be proud of.

The last thing a teenager would want to do during the summer time is school work! If it is a project on a subject they enjoy, it can potentially have a better turnout, with a better grade, then a project where the teacher provides the design guidelines. I have a friend that once needed to complete a summer assignment, it was for science. It required her to analyze different leafs with a magnifying glass, and right a report on her observations. She did not care to do this, and had no motivation to spend her freetime completing a project she did not take interest in. End of summer comes around, and it never got done, she ended up with a D- on this project. She recieved this grade because of the lack of interest, and how boring the assignment was to her. It was not a great start to her school year. In contrast to my friend, my science teacher gave us a project prompt with freedom; create a project relating to science! My friends and I had a blast making this project, keeping it educational, but it still allowed us to do fun activities! The project received an A+. These different project designs put two students in very different positions; a bad grade with a boring, and no effort outcome, then a student filled with excitement, and a good grade. The impact a project can do on a student is important, especially during their time of year where they want to have fun.

Some may argue that summer projects would not have as much of an educational connection if it is student designed. A teacher assigning a research essay will have a more educatonal relation then doing a student chosen topic and activity. This opinion could be shown by the older generation of teachers, where traditional learning styles are better. This is not necessarily true, as creativity combined with education can be more beneficial to students. A survey showed that student chosen projects recieved better grades and more participation. 93% of the surveyed students said they put more effort into their chosen topics, and form of presentation, because it was not chosen by the teacher. There would not be a lack of educational content, if the loose rubric outlined the mandatory educational part of the project. This keeps the projects having a wide variety, while they must stay educational to recieve a good grade.

Students need a break from the strict, instructional environment, the one they are in all year. Summer is their time to have that break. These few months can still provide the educational progression they need, but with a free of choice. Creativity is what shapes this world, and provides advancement in our society. If students are not creative through their schooling now, how will they be creativity in the future?         ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
AB403848DA21,"Every summer, students nationwide are bombarded with projects that are supposed to help them retain information or get a head start on the upcoming year. These projects can range from a series of math problems to studying entire chapters of text for a quiz on the first day of school. Teachers intend to help their students retain knowledge from previous years, but most students consider the projects busy work. Students want to use the summer to recharge themselves and forget about required projects. Students want to do well in school, but most of them have their eyes on the future, rather than reviewing work from the past. Although some may believe otherwise, summer projects should be student-designed because students know what information they struggle with the most, and students are more motivated to work on projects that they select.

First off, students know what information they struggle with the most, so they can create projects that are relevant to those topics. For example, during this past summer, I recalled that my weakest point in Algebra 2 was graphing rational functions, so I decided to make a picture out of rational functions. I made a picture of a snowman and used the holes, the most confusing part of rational functions, as eyes for the snowman. While my artwork was nothing special, the purpose of the project helped me master a tough part of Algebra 2, while preparing me for calculus. Similarly, my parents, who took psychology courses at Generic_School, said that their professor recommended that they review any quiz or test that they felt was the most difficult over spring break to prepare for the final. After reviewing every term that initially confused them, every student in the class increased their grade on the final by at least five percent. The professor did not require them to do anything, but the students knew what they needed to review and succeeded in the end. Students learn best when they are set free to review material using their own strategies, instead of getting a cookie cutter approach from a teacher.

Secondly, students are more motivated to learn when they have no guidelines and can be more innovative, which makes student-designed summer projects the best option. For instance, I only took Digital Art in my Sophomore year because everyone is required to take an art class in high school, but as the year went on I realized that I enjoyed the freedom of the class. After learning basic tools, I made creative posters, characters, and videos, which eventually led to my teacher selecting me as an award winner. Every day, I looked forward to Digital Art because it was the least structured class where everyone could express themselves through their work. From a historic perspective, Albert Einstein was never described by his teachers as a good student. He would never pay attention in class because his mind was always set on bigger, more innovative things. He is widely regarded as the smartest person to ever live which highlights his intuition that was being halted by structured learning. If we were all confined to complete teacher-designed projects everyday, we would not have any of the technological inventions that have drastically changed the world.

Some teachers may say that they are best fit to make summer projects because they know the material that will be taught in the upcoming year. When teachers assign projects, they always have their eyes set on the end goal of having ample time to review at the end of the year for big exams. To accomplish this, teachers always stay inside the curriculum of the course during their summer projects to give their students extra time to learn less material. While it is understandable that students need a head start on the curriculum for the year, that reasoning is flawed because students are already restricted in their education for nine months out of the year, and they do not need to be restricted for another three months. The summer is a perfect time for students to get internships at places that will improve their knowledge and strengthen their passions. Often times, the work that students find at internships is not similar to the the structured work they complete in school. We should allow students to make projects about what they have learned outside of school, so they can educate other students who have similar interests. Teachers already have enough control over how students learn, and it is important that we do not give them even more.

Overall, student-designed summer projects would give more variety to the school and improve the versatility of students. Students are able to find passions through their own work and can inspire others to do the same. Teacher-designed summer projects have restricted students and prevented them from reaching their maximum potential. Students are more powerful than people give them credit for, and they deserve a chance to showcase what they can do through their own ideas. If we allow students to make their own summer projects, we will immediately see an impact on communities through volunteer projects and environmental projects. We need to encourage our principals to just try it out. Give our students a chance to make a difference in the world, and they will never regret giving the students a chance.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
08FBED9A66DA,"There is a plethora of school's around the world that requires students to do a summer project over the course of their summer break. Most of the time, the project is designed by the following teacher. Many would agree with the decision of making the project based off of what the teacher prefers rather than the students because it'll give the student a quick blueprint on what to look for and also what to research for the following project but I believe that the summer projects should be student-designed because it makes the student confident in their work , it'll be personal, and it'll also keep the student interested in the project.

Confidence is very important when it comes to a project. According to statistics, 85 percent of students projects are terrible and bland when it's teacher-designed. With that being said, student-designed projects boosts the students confidence and make the student also put effort into the project. Most of the time, when I'm given a teacher-designed project, I don't put enough thought into it because I think i'll already get a bad grade . Even when i do put my all into a teacher-designed project, I still get second thoughts on if i should turn it in. Many students around my school have been complaining that the teacher-designed projects leads them into a deep depression because their aren't sure if the following project would make their grade drop drastically. Most of the time when teachers give out a project they expect the student have prior knowledge on the topic but most of the time, that doesn't be the case.

Over the summer, students experience multiple encounters. During that time, students are out enjoying the summer breeze with friends and family. Even if the student didn't do anything during their break, being that the students have a project based on their own opinion, makes the project more personal in a sense. Its gives them many topics to look forward to putting in their project.

Lastly, a student-designed project makes the student very interested in their assigned project. Having interest in what you do is also very important because you take your time and put more effort in to your work. Most of the time, when a student is given a teacher-designed project it lacks interest. Which makes the project become very weak and not meet the standards. When I was given a project on my favorite things to do, I aced it because it was about me and because it was about something that interested me. Giving students a project on what their are interested in gives the teacher a understanding on their point of views on situations and also helps them understand their students more.

Giving students-designed projects rather than teacher-designed projects gives the student reassurance that they will get a good great on the project. Especially over the summer break, most students dont have any interest at all about teacher-designed projects. If the students can put their own twist and flavor into the project; the outcome would be very much better!                  ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
B11A853443A1,"Teachers should not be allowed to give their students a summer project at all.

The summer is supposed to be the student's break.

If the teachers do give them a project over the summer it should at least be the student's choice.

The student can make the project revolve around their vacation that way it will not take as much time from what is supposed to be a break from school work.

When a kid chooses to do something they will have a lot more interest in what they are doing which will result in better work ethic.

If the student gets told what to do then they will want to rebel and make a bad project with little effort; they might not even do the project.

Since the reason they are doing a summer project in the first place is so that they continue to learn over the summer, then it is in the teachers best interest to let the students decide what it is on.

For example; In eighth grade I wanted to be in the science fair and I got to choose what the project was on.

The project was my choice and I ended up getting second place in the competition.

This year for chemistry all the students had to do a project that was related to chemistry.

The project was a large portion of our grade so we had to do it.

Everyone did their own project and presented it in front of class.

The projects were not very good and only a few people got above a 90 percent.

If it had not been mandatory and was for extra credit project, than the students probably would have put forth more effort and gotten a better grade.

This shows that they should get to choose their summer projects that way they actually try to make a good project instead of being lazy like they did on the chemistry project.

In some cases it could be better to let the teachers decide on the projects, because then they will be easier to grade, since they will all be similar.

The students could benefit from this too because then they can help each other or even make a group project.

It would also be beneficial to the kids who struggle to make decisions because then they won't have to waste time thinking about what to do the project on.

Although, I do not think these benefits outweigh the benefits of the students getting to decide on their own project.

Over the summer students should get to rest their minds and relax.

In order to do this the work that they are given over the summer should be easy.

If a teacher gives a summer project then they should let them decide what it is on that way it will be as easy as it gets to do the project.

The main purpose of the summer is for students to get a break from school work and the teachers should not ruin it with a boring project they decided we would have to do.            ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
D9AFEF8F5C41,"Summer is the time for most students to take a well-deserved break, and to relax until the next school year arrives. However, the question of whether or not students should have homework during this time is very relevant, and many can't seem to find a consensus on the multiple aspects of that question. One part of said question is whether or not projects should be teacher-designed or student designed. There are many advantages and disadvantages in both viewpoints; however, one is more logical than the other. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they would be more challenging and relevant than student-designed projects, effectively keeping students brains active over such a long break. Being teacher-designed also enables students to have a glimpse of what their future classes for that school year looks like, and enforces a more equal and realistic standard on the actual work itself.

One advantage of having teacher-designed projects would be the aspect of challenge and relevance that it would bring in opposition to a student-designed project. The teachers certainly have the credibility to assign work specific to their class, while many students (if given freedom to design their own project) may not have an idea of what to do or how to start. The challenge of potentially new material also helps keep their brains fresh, and sparks a sense of interest towards the class. Having teacher-designed projects is also useful in reviewing material for classes that may have more levels. For example, many students forget basic algebra that they learned a couple years before taking Algebra II. Being given a project or homework from the teacher to guide them through re-learning some of that material would be beneficial not only for keeping their brains sharp, but for the helpful review for the class that comes with it.

Although one might say that it's unfair to do work over break and that the students should have the ability to choose the work they must do, it is less practical to operate in such a way. It is much more beneficial for the students in the long run to be able to keep their minds sharp over break, because it is easier to ease back into school and is helpful in becoming more intelligent overall. As a student myself, I have experienced summers where I have had summer homework, along with others where I have not. It was much easier to get back into school when I had summer homework to keep me occupied during the summer, and there was also a sense of accomplishment that came along with finishing it. Having the tangible assignment and deadline was also something that forced me to work on it and not procrastinate. On the flip side, if I hadn't had those certain restrictions it would have been much more difficult to me to work on and complete the project. Realistically, if projects were student-designed, it would also be much more difficult for teachers to accommodate every student individually and keep the criteria equal if they were to give them too much freedom. Therefore, it is just simply easier and more practical to have one guideline provided from the teacher.

Another advantage for the students is the fact that they would be able to have a glimpse of what the work for their future class entails, allowing them to have more flexibility in determining whether they would want to continue taking the class before the school year begins. It is generally easy to pick up on a teacher's way of teaching/the difficulty of the class when assigned summer projects directly from the teachers themselves. This allows students to have the option to switch to a higher or lower level if they find that the work doesn't match what they were expecting. If students were to design the project themselves, it would be much harder to pick up on how difficult the course actually was, which could be an unpleasant surprise at the beginning of the year.

Overall, the mere practicality of having teacher-designed projects outweighs the advantages of having student-designed projects. It is more beneficial for both the students and teachers as they come into the year feeling a little more prepared for the class. Looking forward, we should strive to implement (or re-implement) summer homework in schools because of the advantages of keeping a sharp mind and having more flexibility with the classes. However, we also must keep in mind that there should be certain restrictions on what the teachers can assign so that students can enjoy their break and not be overwhelmed or stressed by a sheer mass of work to complete. Generally, it is important to keep the minds of the students active in order to help them ease back into the school year easily. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
4FAC3B29417F,"The final bell on the last day of school is a sound that is rejoiced by students and teachers alike. This bell is the signal to the beginning of summer break. While this break is usually filled with vacations, sporting events, and sleeping late, there is another key element that represents summer break for many students: the project. This project is incorporated into the summer break to assure that students continue learning. In many schools, this project is teacher-designed, resulting in uninterested and procrastinating students. In addition, many teacher-designed projects do not foster creativity. These negative results of teacher-designed summer projects can be reversed by allowing student-designed projects. Student-designed summer projects allow students to choose a topic that they are interested in, be creative, and enjoy learning.

By allowing students to choose a topic that is compelling to them, they will be driven to complete the project with their best effort. Students will also have the option to choose a possible career path and research it throughout the summer. With their research and project, students can essentially ""test drive"" their intended career, instead of waiting until college to discover that they are completely uninterested in their major. For example, one student may desire to become an elementary school teacher. In her project, she decides to research how to become a teacher and the skills that the profession requires. After completing her research, she creates a binder of lesson plans that correspond with her state's standards of learning for her grade of choice. Consequently, she discovers that she truly has a passion for teaching and is reassured on her career choice through this student-designed summer project. The skills that she learned, including her lesson plans, can be used if/when she decides to become an elementary school teacher. While students are allowed to explore professional realms through student-designed summer projects, the possibilities are endless.

When students have the option to be creative with their project, this captures the interest of many artistic students. Teacher-designed projects are mostly straightforward, and have clear right and wrong answers. As a result, there is minimal room for creativity and originality. However, student-designed projects give students the ability to create an interesting and creative project, that captivates not only their attention, but the teachers that will evaluate it the next school year. For example, a student who is very creative may choose to design a project that showcases ways to use recycled materials in art. This project not only uses their artistic and creative abilities, but it also incorporates scientific and environmental strategies.

Student-designed projects allow students to enjoy learning. Some students who may dislike school, may discover a new found love of learning when they are given the opportunity to create the framework of their project. Students are more likely to enjoy a project on a topic that they have a passion for rather than a topic that is simply assigned to them by a teacher. Responsibility skills are also developed as a result of student-designed projects, since they not only are required to complete the project, but they also must develop the project. However, some teachers dislike student-designed projects since there is no clearly set standards or grading rubric, which results in a lengthy grading period. While this can be true, teachers can create an overall rubric that addresses the key elements that each project must include, no matter the topic.

As a result, summer projects should be student-designed. This project style not only results in increased student involvement, but it also allows them to explore subjects that they may not have been able to otherwise. Student-designed projects also assist in the development of higher-level thinking, organizational skills, and responsibility skills; all of which are necessary in the professional world. Students are not only enjoying their topic, but they are also continuing to learn, which is the overall concept of summer projects. With student-designed projects, the possibilities are truly endless.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
90E5BB6CBE11,"I personally think that student should chose there on summer projects because is not going to be as much fun if a teacher choose it. I dont think students are going to do there summer project if is something boring. If student do something there interesting on they are going to do research and finish there project on time because went summer hits not many student are interesting on doing work. I think that is going to be fun doing something i like and not something the teacher wants us to do.

If student do a summer project about just studient animals look for there behavior, some student mite think is fun. They would be some student that is going to be boring or they won't go out as much and not see animals at all. I think student should just pick the topic they think is going to be fun for them and they are going to enjoy reaching about whatever they want to learn. Teacher can grade something interesting not some boring work they tell us to do. i think even the teacher can have fun reading all the thing we come up with in the summer is just going to be fun for student and teachers.

I think teacher would be even happier if student do something they are going to get the benefits of it maybe a student wants to learn about how to treat a open cut or how to save the world from pollution. That would be something interesting that a student can learn about and who knows it mite come in handy and same the world from pollution and treat open cuts because your mom or friends got a dip cut in the house or in school. I just think is a way to learn about something you want not what the school wants us to learn.

I think this is a good way to make all the students to learn something they enjoy doing. You are going to do a interesting project the you are going to like and is just fun to learn new things. you are going to learn even more by doing something fun.",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
C5113BD6EDBF,"Most schools will assign summer assignments that give students a preview of what their upcoming year will be like in certain classes. This also helps teachers because they won't be teaching a new topic to a bunch of students who have no previous knowledge on the subject. Having summer assignments allows students to have a foot in the door for a new class. These projects would be considered, ""teacher-designed"". An example of a teacher-based assignment would be assigning students to look into a concept they will be learning that year in the class; if you are going into Chemistry, you might be assigned to memorize the periodic table over the summer. I believe that summer projects should be student-designed in a way that students have the opportunity to refresh themselves on things they've learned in the past or just a few simple problems or equations a day to keep the brain active. Student-designed projects would be more beneficial to students for many reasons; they won't be as stressed out to learn a new topic by themselves, they will have the opportunity to refine past skills, and it won't ruin their summer break.

Most students in high school have a lot of pressure on them to get good grades, be involved, and stay out of trouble. Whether it be parents, friends, or teachers, every high school student feels stress. Summer break allows students to relax, hang out with friends, and give their brains a break. By assigning summer projects that involve learning a completely foreign topic, the stress of school is reignited and takes that break away from the students. Although assigning these types of projects would be beneficial to the teacher,

I believe it is wrong to make students feel more stressed than they already are just so the teacher can catch a break. For example, when I was in 7th grade I took Pre-Algebra. I remember it was a pretty hard year for me and I was so happy when it was over so I could relax over the summer. On the last day of school my teacher handed my a book titled, ""Algebra 1, the basics"". We had to complete an entire booklet on a math class that we had almost no knowledge about. I spent hours and hours over that summer trying to teach myself Algebra 1 just so my teacher wouldn't have to. This is just more work that causes unneccessry stress in students already busy lives.

Assigning student-based summer assignments would actually be more beneficial to both teachers and students than you'd think. Most classes build on classes that you've had in the past, for example Spanish 2 builds off of the things you learned in Spanish 1. Students are constantly learning new things and gaining new experiences. When you're constantly learning and growing, it can be easy to forget what youve done in the past. Due to this, classes usually begin the year by re-teaching things from previous years. For example, if you took Algebra 1 as a freshman and Algebra 2 as a junior, you would need to review some of those concepts you learned in Algebra 1 to be successful in Algebra 2. If this review work is assigned over summer, students will be able to go into Algebra 2 more prepared and it would save the class a lot of time. The time that would normally be spent on review from previous years could be spread out throughout the year and allow the teacher to spend more time on different units. This would allow the students to feel less stressed about learning a topic in a short amount of time.

Speaking of short amount of time, the summer is the 2 months a year that students can wake up every morning and not have to worry about pressing due dates, homework, studying for tests, or anything school related. I wish I could say that there shouldn't be summer assignments at all. However, I recognize they're important for success and are beneficial to us as students. Assigning student-based assignments are short and easy refreshers for students. I would have no problem waking up every day and doing a couple math problems from a concept I previously learned. Once you get going on a topic you once knew, it all comes back to you and the work should be easy. This is much less stressful than trying to teach yourself for a class you have in the upcoming year. This past summer I was given a summer assignment for my AP Lang class. We were tasked with writing 15 papers about different topics that we chose (with one topic per paper). Each page had to written in a specific format called, ""precis"". We were never taught about this format of writing so it made completing the summer assignment extremely difficult. After about 20 hours of work I was finished with the project. As a freshman I was given a summer assignment for my English class that simply tasked us with reading a book. Every day I would go outside, lay down, and read 30 pages of the book. It was a completely stress free experience that kept my mind active over the summer. I find that these summer assignments are far more helpful for students and their mental health.

Most students will say that summer assignments are useless and aren't beneficial to anyone. I disagree and can argue that anyone who completes the assignment is benefiting from it. By doing nothing over the summer, you are setting yourself up for a rude awakening come August 24. Summer assignments should simply be used to keep our minds in a ""school mode"" without us really knowing. There should no serious work or stress involved. That is why I believe that student-based summer assignments are more beneficial than teacher-base assignments. After all, the teachers are the ones being paid to teach, not the students.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
5C9E35099AEF,"Just imagine, the cool summer air, blowing on your face as you and your friends play outside getting the vitamin D you need. Oh,now imagine seeing all of this from the inside of your house because your history teacher made you read a whole textbook so you could write a 6000 word essay and presentation by the end of summer. Now imagine you writing an essay for that same history teacher, but about a World War 2 museum that you went to with you family and friends,that could be a possibility. The students learn and the teacher gets a project, a win win. That is why students should be the ones who design the summer projects to provide student with a fun summer break, but have the teachers feel confident that their students still know the knowledge they left with or even learn something new.

When a student gets a project that has a set of guidelines and no room for creativity, the student can feel bored and not want to do the project to their best ability. This is because all they would have to do is just answer a question, write a couple paragraphs and then they are done. This can't prove what a person has learned because they could easily copy and friend, find the answers online, or have someone who may know what the teachers wants then they can just use that person to make the project an A+. If a student designed the project, then the student can show what they know and what they learned over the school year, but also see how that topic can be introduced in the real world.

Projects are teachers ways of getting a easy grade from the kids and to really tell if a student knows the subject. Lets say that there is a student who wasn't in class a lot for different reasons,but caught up throughout the year because they did the easiest way to get by. The project for the summer was a topic that he got a good grade on only because he learned the whole thing before he test. Then fails the project because it was on something that was out of their control, but if they could have made the project themselves, he could get a much better grade and still show the teacher that they are not confident on that topic,but knows the other needed topics. This is a win win to the student and teacher, so that both can have a good, stress less summer.

Teachers always say that ""knowledge is forever if you really know it"", but what do you say for a topic you learned all year, worked so hard to get, took notes every class, and some how when the teacher wants you to show what you know in a project that they made, it comes up a little short. All student learn different, some are really good at remembering dates,people, or events, and some know the topic, but don't know how to explain it in the teachers words. The projects that teachers give to see if you remember anything from class cater to the 1% of kids who can give the teacher everything that they want on that project just as the teacher wants. Yet the rest of the student who know the topic, but can not explain it the way the teacher wants get left behind. Some student can write a whole essay about why the French Revolution happened, some can make a cartoon about the same thing, but the student with the cartoon can't turn their project in because the teacher wanted an essay. Its things like that for projects over the summer to be designed by the student and not the teacher.

Overall, students should be allowed to make the summer projects because it is for them too. It also shows what they don't know out of a subject or topic and it can help them get better too. It also makes the projects fun because then again, it is a summer project, kids want to enjoy there summer and not have to think of all the time they spent on a project that they don't care about and have no say in. If the student can have fun with the project then they will remember the topic even more because they can remember how much fun they had doing it and will remember the important parts on when they know and the teacher can have fun seeing what the student has accomplished. Both want to enjoy their summers, right?

Some schools are requiring student to complete summer projects to make sure they continue learning during break. Teachers are creating this projects for the students and sending them on their way. Students are wasting the little time they have to just relax and be a kid on projects that could make no sense to them. This is why students should be the ones who design the summer projects to provide student with a fun summer break, but have the teachers feel confident that their students still know the knowledge they left with or even learn something new.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
CFCB45ABFDA6,"Summer break is that time of the year where students are fresh out of school. They immediately start what has been planned prior to their break starting, but always forget one thing which is the information that they have been taught. Summer projects happen in some schools, but these projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects allow for students to work in many ways to gain information and students can limit themselves as to how much they want to learn.

There are many ways a student can learn information. An example of this is a site called KhanAcademy which can be used to learn any subject. This site has a lot of information that can be learned, especially when it comes to the people who struggle in math and they can visualize what is being shown through an instructional video on how to do things. Another way to learn during the summer is by reading books and articles online or at a local library. Elementary schoolers to this day still read over the summer and keep track with their reading log in order to improve their reading skills, but some schools offer rewards for learning over summer break. Having a student design their own project can allow them to use as many resouces as they want like each other. A family member, friend, or associate can teach them something they don't know or have struggled on.

Students should be able to limit themselves when trying to learn something new or old, if they do not understand it. Allowing students to do this can help them out on knowing how to prioritze and can help them to become a self starter without needing guidance from a teacher. Some people feel the need to learn more than they do in school because what has been learned can be useful in their daily lives. For example, using the skills learned in a family and consumer science class can be used out in the real world such as how to shop for groceries, take care of clothing, etc. Learning more can essientially make things in life easier while being in and out of school. Information like this can be shared with one another in order for their lives to be easier as well.

Although, student-designed summer projects can show how creative and organized a student can be, not all students are capable of wanting to learn over the summer because they are not motivated enough to do so. They would rather focus on what fun they will be doing during the summer because they feel like enough has been learned throughout the school year. Some students will continue to procrastinate on designing their own project that would be given before the break even starts.

Being able to come back to school next year will be less stressful without trying to remember things that have been forgotten about over a certain period of time. It is always best to stay up-to-date with all the things that are taught. It also feels nice to carry around knowledge known to themselves, but not to others. Students may be updated with their knowledge to the point where they might show their teachers a few things. This is why summer projects should be student-designed.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
F0246A38BA8C,"Some schools require students to make summer projects to assure they continue learning during break, it might be a good idea for schools to do this, that way students will have a lot time to complete the work, and at the same time the students would not forget what was learned during all school year, the best way to do this, is that the teachers make the designed for the project and not the students, to make it more challenging and hard to do.

The teacher-designed idea can be the best way to let the student get a summer-project that is difficult,challenging, and that contain all the things learned in the whole year of class, this way students will use their notes and thing that were made in the on the school year, for example the teacher can make a project with questions that need information from the past notes,that way students will need to find and read again all their notes in order to make this project, if the student make her own project, it can be easy for them and not that hard to complete, because the student will try to make a project that can be complete fast and that don't take a lot time.

Students during summer break have a lot time to do many things, sometimes during summer, students don't find something to do and most of them waste a lot time, a better way to not waste that time during vacations, is to make a project, that's why is better for the school to make the project by the teacher-designed, this way it can be longer and challenging for the student to complete, the more time that is led to complete this project can led students to be more creative and to try to make a really good project to get a good grade on it and this will let to think more about the things learned on school too.

When schools made this summer project a requirement for all students to complete, it was to make sure that the students will continue learning during their break and that way students don't lose what was learned, another thing is that can make student to be more creative, for example is a teacher-designed project was about, things that students do during theirs summer vacations, this can make the student to not stay in home all day, because it will not be a good project to do, or to stay playing videogames, the student will prefer to go out and talk about that things.

The main ideas for the schools by doing this is to make the students more responsible, and to make sure that they continue learning, it will be almost the same as summer school but the project canbe finished at home,another thing is that the summer projects that are made by teacher-designed is the best choice for all school, it make the student to be more creative, and the project will be more challenging and hard, and it will take a several time to completed.             ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
11040FD6C88D,"Grades are the most important thing to a student, whether they know it or not. The future of a student strongly depends on their ambition and effort in school. Without these traits they will perform poorly throughout the school year. Towards the end of the year, many students are eager to get into their swimsuits and relax under the heat of the sun, causing them to slack off in school. Some schools now require students to complete a summer project to assure that they continue to learn during their summer break. Even though this idea may fix their students lack of education over the summer, this still brings upon an argument. These schools are now debating on making these summer projects teacher-designed or student-designed. Schools should only allow summer projects to be teacher-designed, reminding society that teachers know best when it comes to their students' education.

Teachers know how to help their students understand the curriculum the most. These teachers have gone to college to learn how to teach their students. They know how to challenge their students and give them the best education. A student's education is very important when it comes to getting into college and finding the job that they want. Without the help of a well-educated teacher, the student will not be able to learn and have a well-rounded education.

Teachers are role models to their students. A student needs a role model or someone to look up to when growing up. This helps them know what they should strive to be. Teachers can be a good role model because they have traits that will help you outside of school. A few of those include being responsible, able to work with new people, and understanding to those around them. All of these will help you in later in life, which is why when the student sees their teacher as a role model their work ethic will improve. This work ethic will cause students not to slack off on the summer project.

Some people might say that summer projects should be student-designed. If summer projects were student-designed, students could make the project too easy. This means that the students won't learn anything and they will forget what they learned before. On the other hand, the teacher will make the project challenging, but not too difficult, in order for the student to learn the topic. When the student is questioned on these projects it will be easier to keep what they learned in their head, instead of them not learning anything because the project is too easy.

When the student is able to understand a topic, not just memorize it and forget it later, they will have better grades. Grades will heavily impact their future due to a probable need for a college education. Meaning that, whatever the student may want to do outside of high school, it most likely needs a higher education than high school. In the mean time, students can rely on their teachers to help them become what they want to be. Which is why when schools choose teacher-designed summer projects, society will understand that the teacher can have a positive impact on their students outside of school and inside of school by helping them get the most out of their education.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
18322782389D,"""I've waited a long time for this!"" exclaimed Generic_Name. It was the first day of summer break and he was so excited to have fun with his friends. After a long day of playing outside with his friends, he walked in the house and his mother handed him a paper that she had printed out. ""What is this for mom?"" Generic_Name asked as he twisted his face up. His giggling mother answered, ""Well, this is your summer project that your seventh grade English teacher Generic_Name assigned to you and it is due the first day you go back to school."" Generic_Name scanned the paper in disbelief as he read,

""Research about one of the gods in Greek mythology. Create your project explaining your god in detail all about them.""

Generic_Name felt as if a person that heavier than the world itself was sitting on his shoulders. He exhaled and shook his head as went up stairs realizing he couldn't have the whole summer free with his friends anymore. he thought if so, ""Why couldn't she have gave us more instruction on what to do?!"" While many students believe that teachers should give them more detail on what to do on their projects, it is in the students best interest to create their own design because it will keep them active in learning throughout the summer, students will gain confidence and be more comfortable with creating something, and they will get a higher grade on their project.

Students tend to forget the things the learned over the summer. They would have to think more if they were to design their own project. Which keeps their brain flowing and help them remember the things they learned that school year. In my opinion, I believe that them remembering things they've learned will help them in the future.

This is why it's good for students to design their own projects.

When creating something, there is no right wrong too it because you made it up. Students will fill more comfortable with their work. By them becoming comfortable, it will make the project easier and more enjoyable for them. For example, many people in my class and I enjoy it when we are allowed to expand our creativity and the pleasure in doing so make our project look like masterpieces. Another reason why students benefit for creating their own project from scratch.

By students having to start their projects from scratch, they will have to research thoroughly. The extreme research they will be doing will help them get and good grade on their project. The more information obtained the better outcome of the project. Even though students find research excruciating, it is a big contribution to projects. Research will be more of help with students designing their own projects.

In conclusion, projects that are designed by students keeps them on their toes in learning, are more comfortable to create, and students will get A's on their project. It will help them succeed in life and make them proud of their selves. In comparison to teacher-designed projects, student-designed projects helps in the long run and gives benefits that is unremarkable.                       ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
3510B0339301,"I believe that student designed summer projects would be more beneficial for the students, teachers, and parents than teacher designed projects. If students designed the projects they would be more likely to do the project and finish it in a timely fashion. Although teacher designed projects would be easier for the teachers because they know what they want and it allows for more structure, student designed projects would be something the students enjoy doing and would allow the students to get their work done at their own pace.

To start, student designed projects are more likely to be worked on throughout the summer and completed by the time school starts again. If the students are doing something that they enjoy they are more likely to finish it; therefore, the project being based off something they like would allow a higher chance of it getting done. For example, an elementary school had students pick an outdoor animal/insect they found in their backyard to research about and find some fun facts on. These students enjoyed and completed their projects because although they were assigned a teacher designed project they got to pick out what creature they did the project on which was more fun for them. Students are motivated by rewards so rewarding themselves at milestones of the project would increase the likeliness of students getting their work done as well. To reward oneself for completion of an important section of the project, the student could go out for ice cream or even get a new toy depending on their motivations. These objectives of student designed projects all show a higher chance of completion which is ultimately what the schools desire.

Additionally, parents can become involved with the projects and engage with their students. Interaction between parents and their children is crucial to build a healthy relationship and parents assisting their children with a project can help build their relationships. Parents can also learn new things while helping their student which can make the student more interested in the project because the student and parent are both learning new things, not just the student, so it will cause the student want to learn more. Younger children are more reliant on their parents than older children are so they need more help with their schoolwork than older students typically do. An elementary school student would need more assistance from their parents gathering all the information necessary for them to complete their project; however, a middle school or high school student will require little, if any, assistance from their parents because they become more independent as they get older. As an elementary student reading projects can be harder because they do not have experience with these types of assignments causing them to need more help from parents or older siblings; however, a high school who has completed several reading projects and has much more experience is not gonna need as much help or any help at all from parents. Projects can be extremely easy or super complex depending on the materials needed and amount of work that is needed to be put in, but either way help from a parent can be very helpful for students of any age.

Student designed projects provide the opportunity for students to work at their own pace and get the work done around their own schedule. During the summer many students go on vacation which can last a couple days or several weeks, so having students design their own project would allow them to complete the project when they can around their busy schedules. Some students also go to camps, such as 4H or YMCA summer camps, which can take up a lot of their time and if these students had to complete a teacher designed project that had to be worked on for a certain amount of time and they did not have that much time then they would not be able to complete it. Time management is super important especially for people with very busy schedules and if their time is not managed correctly they will not be able to finish their projects as they wish to. These projects being student designed would be more beneficial for students who have very busy summers and for parents as well making them not have to worry about their child getting their work done on time.

To conclude, student designed projects can be much more helpful for not only students but teachers and parents as well. Because the projects would be created by the students they would be more likely to be completed because it is something they would enjoy doing, the parents can become more involved and engaged with their students, and the projects would allow the students to work at their own pace to complete their projects. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
084BB657A9C4,"Summer projects are what most students dread during their break, but they are necessary for students to keep expanding their minds during the summer. Most of the time these projects are designed by the teachers, but normally those projects are not as fun to do. While student-designed projects would be more interesting for a student to learn from and they would enjoy it more. Summer projects should be student-designed because it would be easier for the students to understand, it would give more reason for students to do it and put effort in to the project over their summer vacation, and it would be an appealing and fun method of learning for the students.

These student-designed summer projects are normally easier to understand for students. Generic_Name is a student at a middle school and he has to do a summer project, which was a project about what is the hardest part of school and creating a PowerPoint on it which was created by a student in his grade. When his summer started,Generic_Name could clearly read what he is supposed to do for his project and he could get to it right away. He created one of his most enjoyable PowerPoints because it was easier for him to talk and write about, when it was teacher designed, the project was about explaining into depth why ones years in middle school are the hardest years of schooling, he took a lot of time trying to understand what the project really was and how it worked. Generic_Name could understand the project more since it was made by a student and it would be easier for a student to understand a student than a student trying to understand a teacher. Generic_Name is a 5th grade student who has a summer project. Going into 6th grade next school year, Generic_Name has to do a project on what middle school is going to be like for him as a student, which is what he has to think about anyways since he is going into middle school. Students in his grade would know what kids their age would understand and what they are normally thinking of which was in his case going into middle school. In student-designed projects for the summer, students would understand these projects more because students understand what other students are thinking of and are going through.

These type of summer projects would give students more of a reason to put effort and actually do the project. Generic_Name, a student who wants to become a website designer, is asked to do a summer project in his IT class. The project was creating a poster of something one would like to do for their profession in IT, this project was created by a student in his IT class whom which knew that students would not like a project about one topic. When it got to the summer Generic_Name was more motivated to get his project done because he could talk about his passion which was website design. Generic_Name put more effort into his project because it was created by a student who understood other students would not like to talk about a single topic. Generic_Name, a photography student, has a summer project on what their summer vacation is like in pictures for his photography class, this project was made by a student in his photography class. Generic_Name put more effort into it because it is something he found interesting and he had more of a reason to take pictures of even though years prior his teacher made projects about taking a photograph of an exotic animal and write a paper about it, he liked this idea for a project because he could just enjoy his summer vacation while also doing his summer project at the same time. Students find these summer projects more interesting and put more effort into it because they are made by other students in their classes.

Summer projects that are student-designed would likely appeal to students making them more fun for the students learn during the project. A high school engineering class is given a summer project, they are asked to build a model rocket, which was a project idea created by a student. The class when they went on summer vacation, had more fun because they got to build something that was more interesting, appealing, and fun for them as students and as young engineers. These students also learned a lot about how rockets work and how the engineering process goes into them. An AP history class is given a summer project, which they are asked to create an alternate historical scenario in which something that happened in history, just did not occur or was altered a little bit, this project idea was created but a student in this AP history class. The students in this class during their summer spent time researching a specific event that they found interesting and tweaked it to their liking, this gave them the power to do whatever they want with history and they found it fun because they learned more about specific events in history and got to change them to completely different scenarios. Summer projects that are student-designed are more fun to the students in these classes because students in those specific class would know what other students would find fun and appeal toward them.

Student-designed summer projects are better for students than teacher-designed ones because they are more for fun for the student to make, they are easier to understand for the students because students learn more from other students, and they would put more effort into those projects because students know what other students in their grade like. Summer projects are a lot of work for students, but if students were allowed to design these projects so that they would appeal to other kids in their classes or their grade more students would do those summer projects and expand their knowledge on topics they should learn or want to learn more about. Overall, summer projects would have more students working on them with strong effort if they were made by students. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
F3F134FA362D,"Schools often assign summer projects to prepare students for the upcoming school year and to ensure learning is continued throughout summer break. Summer assignment are very beneficial to students in many ways. But, at times students fail to complete these assignments. Summer projects should be student-designed because it makes the work more interesting for the student, it helps with motivation, and it can work better with students' busy summer schedules.

Students are often given summer projects from teachers that include countless hours of reading a book or filling out worksheets. These mindless tasks are often overlooked by students and are done in a rush in order to get them over with. Student-designed summer projects are more interesting to students because of how personalized the project could be. Students can research the history of the Caribbean country they are visiting, or write a research paper about summer jobs. The possibilities are endless and the personalization will spark more interest in many students. The project will also be more interesting because it will require the students to use creativity. Schools tend to neglect the importance in creativity and uniqueness in students, and a student-designed project will help with that. Students can use their own creativity to create a unique project that will work for them and their summer. Having an interesting project is important for summer assignments.

Motivation is an important factor in summer projects. Students lack the motivation to do projects deigned by teachers because they seem boring and students would rather spend time doing other summer activities during their break. A student-designed project is less like homework and will give students more motivation to do it.

A personalized project will make students want to work on it. Summer is the time when students want to forget about school and homework and a student-designed project will distract students from the fact that it is a school project. The project will also be more exciting and unique for the students. The assignment will not be the same for each student, this will give students motivation to finish their unique project. Most students have little motivation to do teacher-designed summer projects. But if it is student-designed, that problem will be solved.

Summer projects designed by students leave room for more flexibility. Teacher-designed projects tend to be forgotten about and ignored over the summer break. Students travel and have many things going on in their lives during the summer. A project designed by each student will be unique to their summer schedules. Summer plans will not be disturbed. With a student-designed project, it is almost guaranteed that the students will do it. The project will fit in with each students' individual lives better. This insures that more students will finish a quality project.

Summer projects are good for students and maintaining a learning attitude during the break. These projects should be student-designed. A student-designed project helps to keep students interested and motivated to complete their project. The flexibility of a student-designed project is significantly better for the overall learning of the student.                                                                ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
923043ECE82F,"These summer projects that some schools require students to do should be teacher-designed. If the project is teacher-designed it will challenge the students on what they know and what they might need to learn. Since the projects are teacher-designed you can always ask a teacher for help if needed. Because the projects are designed by teachers, they could also be preparing you for the subject for the next school year. These three points help prove why a teacher-designed project is better than a student-designed one.

The teacher-designed project will challenge the students on topics they would have already learned during the school year. It's a good way of challenging them on what they already know so that they can see what they remember and what they might need to relearn. Some may argue that the students would be too stressed during the summer from the project that they won't really enjoy their summer. However, if they take time and pace themselves the project shouldn't take that much time; since it's based on what they previously learned.

If the projects are teacher-designed you could ask a teacher for help if need, for they would already know the topic of the project. If students have problems or ever get confused they could ask a teacher for assistance. Some may argue that during the summer; teachers won't be willing to help or they might be to busy to be able to do anything. However, most teachers are still reachable through their school email or any other way that you would use to contact them to ask questions.

Because these projects would be teacher-designed, they could also be mentally preparing the students for that subject for the next school year. These projects would be testing the students on new information that they would need to know for the start of the new school year. Some may argue that the teacher-designed projects would be more stressful than it would be useful. However, it would be more helpful to challenge the students on new topics to see where they are at, at comprehending the new topic.

These three points help provide examples on the claim. In conclusion a teacher-designed project would be more resourceful and helpful than a student-designed project.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
8896495B3A61,"Summer projects. Although many students despise summer projects, there are schools that require students to complete summer projects for the purpose of continuing education during the break to keep the student mind active. Some schools have to decide between student-designed projects or teacher-designed projects to assign to students over break. The schools that require summer projects to assure that students continue to learn during summer break should assign student-designed projects because students are more likely to complete them and they have a better final product than if the project was to be designed by a teacher.

If the summer projects were to be student-designed, students would be much more likely to fully complete the project over the course of the whole break rather than last minute. In the last school year, right as summer break was ending, my companions and I discussed summer projects that we had for various classes. What I came to learn was that many had not gotten started and simply did not intend on completing them until the very last week before they were due;the projects had been made by teachers. The objective of a summer assignment is to do it in incriments throughout the break to ensure that the mind is still learning and still active throughout the break. The problem with many summer projects that are teacher-designed is that many students just simply don't complete them or only partially complete them because they do not veiw the project as engagin or interesting. Speaking to Ted, one of my close friends, he explained to me that he did not care about the summer project and just did it to get the grade. When the projects are teacher-designed, students mostly view them as a boring and unengaging. A student is better able to engage other students because they understand what it means to be a student. This is because students have a empathetic knowledge towards other students that teachers don't posess. When students design those summer projects they are able to use that knowledge to design more engaging and interesting projects than teachers.

Another reason that summer projects should be student-designed is that there would be more detailed and more comprehensive final projects than if they were teacher-designed. There have been a few times that I have been able to complete student-designed projects in school. As a result, my finished product was far better planned and much more elaborate than a similar completed project that was designed by a teacher. When a student gets to design a project, the students who work on that project are actually interested in what they are doing since the project has been designed by someone who understands thier interests. When a student is completing a project that they are interested in, they use a completly different work ethic and put passion into the project rather than doing a project which bores them. A similar thing happens in the workplace when individuals complete a task they are not interested in; they get a diminished output and the same principle applies here. Therefore student-designed projects have a better output than a teacher-designed project.

Some may argue the summer project should be teacher-designed because teachers are able to design better projects than students. Any project no matter who it is designed by has to follow a rubric making that argument irrelevant since both of the projects end up following the same guidlines.

Even in the case of the project being better designed by a teacher, the counter-arguement is still incorrect because the teacher-designed project does not end up actually acomplishing the goal of having the students keep learning throughout summer break; the student-designed project does accomplish that goal, by students completing them over the whole break. The counter-argument can even be harmful to the students because they are much more likely to do teacher-designed projects last minute due to lack of interest; when they do that, students end up being really stressed right before they enter school. That can defeat the whole purpose of a break because even having relaxed for all of break, they enter school with a stressful attitude. It is better to have student-designed projects where students are interested in the project and continue to learn throughout summer break then the antithesis of it, where they do it in the end and enter school stressed, not having accomplished the purpose of the project.

All things considered, summer projects that are assigned by certain schools should be student-designed instead of teacher-designed because having them be student-designed ensures that the project will be completed througout the entirety of the break fufilling its purpose and students will have a better final output due to increased interest in the subject matter. When the project is designed by a student, the people completing the project are far more likley to pace themselves and complete it in incriments due to interest in the project. This also ensures that the student will put a greater effort into the project; as a result, the final project they submit will be a more comprehensive product due to project having its own personality and having more individualism than if every student was assigned the same-old project that was designed by a teacher. A counter-argument may be presented that a teacher-designed project will surpass a student-designed project because teachers design better projects. That argument fails when it is considered that a teacher based project defeats the pupose of having a summer project in the first place because students tend to complete those types of project last minute having a diminished output. Then, coming into the new school year stressed and not coming in refreshed, which is the purpose of summer break. In the end, why design a project in the first place, when the way that project is designed defeats the purpose of that project?",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
B0D9116BE51A,"Schools want students to continue their education over summer break with projects the student body want to the design. Should they be allowed to? Although teachers would make the project more educational ad school related, the students should be allowed to make the projects. The teachers would make the project more educational, but it's the students summer break. Summer is a time of fun in the sun and for the students to express creativity, and teachers shouldn't take that away.

First, it's summer break, three months away from school and teachers. The students should be allowed to come up with a way to combine summer and school. All year the teachers drone on and give homework and projects the student had no say in, so its the student's turn to show their creativity and make a project all their own. Giving students this freedom would make the project less boring and painful. It would also inspire them to actually do it instead or them just not caring about it. They get to make something their own. They can do whatever they please with the project. They can make those three months of freedom worth while with a fun project.

Additionally, the teachers would make the project more school related and for a class they will never take again. The student could make the project about the next class they are taking based on research they found from the local library or online. They could visit their dream college and do a report on that. Something the student genuinely cares about. Students don't want to do projects or care about school over summer. They can compromise with the teacher about the project and make it. It can be a big responsibility test, but a fun one. The teacher should trust the students to make fresh and fun ideas on their own instead of forcing another boring school project.

Finally, the projects from teachers requires a single trip to a store and staying inside all summer. They did that enough in school, now is the time for the students to show the teachers what they can do and what they can come up with on their own. The students should be able to go outside and see what they can do with the things they find in nature. They could make a fun, outdoor adventure instead of a boring essay or poster board with little to no creativity or color. Teachers would get more out of the teacher for creativity and personality than something they threw together last minute. As students get older, they want more freedom and rights. They want to be equals with their teachers. Teachers always say they want students to show creativity, so let them.

In conclusion, the students need to pick their projects. For creativity, freedom, and responsibility. Teachers should let their students have creative control over the project. The students should be allowed to do whatever they please over break. It's summer, they should have some fun with it. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
A4B90560C17F,"Over summer break, some schools have their students do projects so then they can keep their brains trained over the period of time they are away from school. These projects are beneficial for students to keep learning throughout their summer break. The question here lies in whether these projects should be designed by the teachers or by the students. Some people think that if it is teacher designed, then it will give students more incentive to get the projects done. That is not the case for most students in this day and age. Summer projects should be designed by students because it will allow students to do the projects they are actually interested in, motivate these students to do their projects, and allow students to move at their own pace.

Whenever students are given the chance to be creative with what they are doing in school, they get really excited about it. If we start doing that with these summer projects, they will want to do them and have fun with it instead of it being forced onto them. It will give them something to look forward to working on, not something they are just drudging through in order to get an A on it. When students are forced to do something they do not want to do, it will give them even more of a reason to not do it. If they got to choose what subject they want to do for these summer projects, it will make them more interested in doing it.

Students these days see summer break as a cool off period to start a new year. Some spend their time just sitting around and using this time to relax or spend time with friends and have fun. Then they get hit with these gigantic projects that they do not want to spend their summer doing. If these projects were student led then it will make students more motivated to actually finish them. If they were led by teachers, then students would just procrastinate until the last minute and go into the school year stressed about the grade they got for it. Then it would make their mentality starting the new year lowered.

Most students learn at a different pace compared to others. So if you make each student do the same exact projects as each other, then it won't be tailored to one individual student. Then they would lose interest in it and not do the project. If you want students to succeed, then you should make a system where they have more freedom to do things that intrigue them instead of making them have to fit a certain mold. If they are allowed to make their own decisions with what they are learning, then they will start being motivated to do their work.

While some schools allow their students to decide what summer project they do, there are other schools that are more strict about it and have the teachers making all the decisions on someones education. This is an unhealthy way to educate children by not letting them express their creativity and not letting them think outside of the box. If we don't let students use their imagination, they would become carbon copies of one another and that is not how education should be. While some argue that teachers should control projects, the healthier alternative is to give students that option instead so they could be more motivated.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
DECFDACB0143,"It's the last day of school and students are excited for their summer break to finally start. They're daydreaming about making memorable memories with their friends and going on relaxing vacations. However, minutes before the last bell, they're handed packets of work and projects that need to be completed for the next school year. There goes their happiness and all of their summer plans. Not only are these assignments pointless, but they also take up way too much time in the summer, which is supposed to be a break. But, what if they were able to choose their own projects to do over the summer? Summer projects should be student designed as it allows students to employ their creativity and develop new ideas.

Summer assignments should be outlets for students to display their creativity. This creativity allows students to apply these projects to their own lives, which in turn allows them to learn effectively. Take for example, a science project I had to do my freshman year of high school. My teacher had given us a criteria for what the basis of the project should be about, but the experiment itself was up to us to decide. I decided my topic would be testing different acidic liquids on the moldiness of strawberries because strawberries were my favorite fruit. Not only was I able to learn about science, such as determining pH levels and how acids work to combat mold, but I was also able to learn something I could apply to my own life. I still use the results of this experiment to this day; squeezing lemon juice on strawberries to reduce any possibility of mold. I was more engaged in the experiment and excited to actually do the procedure solely because of the freedom I had to choose what I wanted to do. This allowed the experiment to feel not like a summer assignment, but something I was doing for fun instead. Additionally, this creativity enables students to become more interested in their projects. Without interest, students are doing assignments just to complete them instead of learning from them. Essentially, this is necessary to keep students engaged and actively learning during the summer, which is the whole purpose of these summer projects.

Furthermore, student designed projects would enable children to establish new ideas and skills. For instance, when students are assigned to write essays on a book over the summer, they essentially just read a summary and think of basic ideas to answer the prompt. Instead, if they were given the freedom to choose their own books to write essays on, they would be more engaged in the project. This would make them think outside of the box which in turn would help them develop new ideas. Last, summer I was given the freedom to read any 20th century book I wanted, and write an essay on an essential question that I created myself. I had chosen the book

Pudding Head Wilson by Mark Twain and my essential question was ""Are our characteristics based more on nature or nurture?"". Not only, did I enjoy reading the book I had chosen but I was also able to learn so many new things about the whole nature vs nurture debate that I hadn't known. I had previously thought our characteristics were a mixture of both, but after researching and writing this paper, I changed my view. My research also led me to learning about psychology and because of this I decided I wanted to major in this topic in college. I would not have been able to come to this decision if I had not been able to choose this book. Additionally, I was able to reinforce critical thinking skills while writing my paper. If students were given this freedom to choose their projects, they would be able to expand their knowledge rather than just utilizing basic information to just complete the task.

While many argue that teacher sets are more structured and standardized so students could be better prepared for the upcoming school year, this is very false. When teachers assign projects to do over the summer, students usually wait until the day before school starts to even look at these assignments. They then decide to just search up the project online hoping to find answers and ideas that they could use as their own. Primarily this disregards the whole purpose of the summer projects:kids continuing to learn during their break. Students aren't actively learning anything throughout their break as they are just doing the project the day before school starts. Also, the projects assigned by teachers are usually on topics that are very boring and students don't want to put any effort into them. These projects are on topics that students can't even apply to their everyday lives so they see no purpose in doing them. For instance when students are assigned to read Romeo and Juliet over the summer, they don't see the purpose as they can't connect to it. How does two lovers on opposite sides fighting for their love, apply to anything students today could relate to? As a matter of fact, it truly doesn't. Due to this, teacher designed projects are overall ineffective and have no true purpose that affects students.

The school system in America has always been about giving students the best education they can receive and utilize in their future. But, how is this possible when teachers are assigning all students material that they can't truly ever use in their everyday lives? Especially when this material is being forced onto students during the summer, the only long break they have to relax and rest their mind. Not only is this material ineffective, but it also doesn't allow students to demonstrate their true knowledge. Students should be able to design their own projects as it allows creativity and enables them to administer new ideas. Students are the future leaders of tomorrow, so their education should allow them to prosper and be the people who help make the world a better place.         ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
843F8AFA3905,"Some schools are requiring students to complete summer assignments to assure that they learn over their break. A majority of the students like the idea but just can't get it done. Teachers often offer ideas as some sort of help. On the other hand, a good amount of students would rather do it themselves to make it more achievable. Students should do their projects without assistance so they can get it done on their own and feel more accomplished.

Students would mostly get an assignment done by themselves. They'd get it done their own way without someone telling them it would look better with this. Having someone telling how to get it done would just make it frustrating. They'd get it done better by themselves because they wouldn't have to listen to anybody else and it'd make them have to focus to get it done. Furthermore, it'd be in the summer.

Having assignments during the summer is also a good way to keep our brain focused about school. It'd remind us on what we had learned all school year. Furthermore, you could research all you'd need without being in a hurry. Designing the projects on your own would make also make it worth doing. It could even make you want to change your summer plans.

It'd be easier for a student to complete a summer project on their own. They'd be able to finish and design it however they'd desire. It might even turn out to be outstanding with all the time they had on their own. The completion of the project could make the student proud of what they've accomplished without assistance. It'd make them always have focus on what they've done. Doing something when you shouldn't have to keeps you busy and benefits you.                           ",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
BC3ABF1DE758,"During school many students find the school work to be hard and lengthy. Projects with certain points that need to be made and completed by certain times frames. A lot of projects are simple and straight to the point, making them all the same old boring presentations. Every student has something unique about them, this is known. They like so show how they are in thoughtful projects and writings. Schools requiring summer projects isn't a bad thing, some students need this to keep their mind flowing with creativity and objectives. But they should be able to design it however they want so it's their own mind work and material. it's easier for some to do projects when it's something they came up with. There is a higher sense of accomplishment when everything you envisioned comes together perfectly. More pride to say, ""yeah, I came up with all of this and did a great job."" Having students come up with their own design is a good way to get them ready for more projects like this during the actual school year.

There is no lie in the fact that during the summer everybody is laid back and relaxing, school not a thought in mind. But, it is also not a lie to say that nobody remembers a single thing from the year before, most of us at least. It's easy to forget something when it hasn't been scanned through your mind for three months. A project designed by a teacher could be a more efficient way for the student to get all their juices flowing again. But what is the fun in that? A project designed by students could be a better way for the student to get their mind working again simply because they are doing it on their own. Finding information, collecting data, reading up on certain topics. All of that being done by a students makes it harder, yes, but also gets them ready for other projects that could end up like that. School has never been a walk in the park for some, and do having to come up with an idea on their own could be a little frustrating and over the top. But school isn't always going to have an easy route so doing hard work by yourself is a good way to get you ready for the hard college years.

A student designed project is a way for the student to get their own ideas out and about. To show that they could still pull off an amazing project even after being out of school for so long. There isn't anything wrong with a teacher coming up with everything, besides the fact that it halts any kind of creativity the students could produce on their own. Common projects are simple, and most teachers want simple, clean cut projects. Ones that get straight to the point. But that has always been boring to naturally artistic students who love to show who they are in projects. You wouldn't give an artist a coloring book and tell them to paint carefully inside the lines, that way doesn't show who they are or what they can do. Giving students a empty slate to do whatever they want is a natural way for them to express themselves. Having fun so it doesn't seem like they are doing that much work.

As stated, their is really nothing wrong with teacher designed projects. But there is a feeling of that it won't mean much since it's has no other kind of creativity in it. Only what the teacher asked for, no extra power behind it to really show off. Students need an extra boost to show who they are and a project that was made with everything by a student is a very good way to start off any school year.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
0872DEBC7F18,"Before the last day of school, teachers should let their students pick their own project to do over the summer. Most likely if the student creates the project on there own it would be more fun an easily for them to handle. With that being said if a teacher was to give students their on project to do during the summer it probably wouldn't get done. Students attend to do better on things that they designed using there thoughts and also creativity.

Creating a project on your own during the summer before going back to school. Would definitely be awesome for them to create and do it on there own. They get to do design the project in any type of way or style that they want to and it would be less stressful for them. Especially if your some one that did a lot of fun things & also went places during the break u should be able have to talk about what u learned over the summer. It be less work when u create a project on your own because in your head u already know what your project is going to be about, and u will already know what u will have to do to complete the project.

A student would most likely stress over doing a project over the summer designed from a teacher. Most students freeze up when they don't understand what the teacher is asking to them to do or how to start off. Then when u do the project most of the time people stress about how to start it off or they start over thinking there self that stresses a lot of students when it comes to projects especially designed from the teacher. Then on top of that teachers expect everything to be done in the right way to earn full points on the project.

I personally think that students should be able to create there own project instead of the teachers. It would defiantly be less work for the teacher. Teachers attends to ask for to much when they give u a project to complete. Working and creating a project on your own help u understand things more it also make u think more in a good way. Things become much better and if u design your own project it can be about something simple and easy that u learned over the summer.                ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
6F4CAC98A2D6,"Schools want students to learn during their break. Assigning summer projects is the best way to ensure that. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students can learn more and so students know what they have to do.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students can learn more. Teacher projects will require students to gain knowledge. Students will gain knowledge about the topic of their project. Students will be learning and then be able to complete the project.

Another reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is so students know what they have to do. Teachers designing the project will explain the project to the students. They will tell the students what they need to do and what the teacher is looking for. Teachers explaining the project will help the students so they won't get lost.

Some people may think that student-designed projects are better. They may think this because students will be able to be more creative. However, student-designed projects aren't the best way for students to learn. Teacher designed projects will ensure that the student is learning and while being creative.

Summer projects help students learn while they are on break. Teachers should design the summer projects so students can learn more and so students know what they have to do.

DC3B3B45F177,"Do you think summer projects should be required? Do you think summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed ? Some schools are now requiring students to complete summer projects to make sure they continue learning during their summer break. Many are arguing whether the projects should be created by teachers or students. Students are convinced they have what takes to create their own project while others are concerned and would rather teachers do it. Some teachers feel the same way they don't think it's fair to put their students education on the line just because they don't have the resources they need in order to be successful. In my opinion teachers should be creating the projects because they have more knowledge/experience,they'll make sure students have the resources they need,and it's easier on them as well as the students. These are some of my reasons as to why I think teachers should design summer projects.

Having a teacher create a project instead of a student is helpful because they have knowledge as well as experience. They know what students struggle with as well as ways to help them. This can be very helpful to students because they're forced to work on their weaknesses and improve them. If they're confused about something on the project they could ask their teacher for help as well as their classmates. Because teachers have experience they know how to prepare their students for the upcoming year which makes it easier on students. If you don't prepare for the next step it can be really difficult to understand later on. It has been said students who don't read or do anything school related over the summer have a hard time understanding when school comes around. I once did this to myself I didn't complete my English summer reading project I thought I was going to be fine but I was wrong school started and I was lost and confused it took me a week to get on track with everyone else. A well constructed project really prepares you and nobody can construct a better one than your teacher.

Another reason as to why teachers should design the project is they know what resources students need in order to succeed. They know what students struggle in so they know activities to help them improve. Because they have resources they can give it makes students lives easier as appose to if a student has to find these resources on their own. Even if students do come up with a project it won't be as good as their teachers therefore it's not helping them out . It would just stress students out and not help them out whatsoever. Students would be more focused on just getting something done than actually looking for resources that could help them. An example of this would be a presentation for school if the teacher told students to do a project on a book without saying anything else students would be confused because they wouldn't have the resources necessary to do this presentation. Resources always help students but it's hard if you're a student trying to look for them on your own. Teachers know of the best resources to help their students succeed.

My last reason as to why I think teachers should create summer projects over students is it make it easier on both sides.

Students will know exactly what they're looking for as well as be tested on their weaknesses. It's easier on teachers because when grading the projects they'll know what their expectations are. While yes having a teacher design a project might be more work for the student it helps them prepare for the future. It also makes it easier on the teacher in the way that they know what they asked for instead of trying to figure out what it was suppose to be. It makes their grading easier and it also shows them what needs improvement and what you're good at. It won't stress students out more than what they are already going to be. It also makes it fair to everyone because they are all going to complete the same project . Nobody is doing more or less than someone else. The work given to the students is equal and fair for all of them to do. This is another reason to why teachers should be the ones creating the projects instead of students.

While students are given many opportunities to show their creativity I still think designing a project shouldn't be one of them. The purpose of a project is to learn and improve important things that could potentially help you in the future not something where you're trying to figure out what might or might not be important. A project should be designed by teachers because they know what's best for their students,they know how to help their students and overall it's easier for everyone. In my opinion teachers should be designing projects for their students. I'ts always been teachers that create the projects therefore it should stay that way.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
2818231D67EE,"Along with other students, Summer has always been one of my favorite seasons; the reason for this is because there's no school. Since there's no school for students during summer, we tend to forget everything that was taught to us throughout the school year. Schools believe students should not forget all of the valuable things we learned throughout the school year when we go into summer break, for this reason many schools require students to complete a summer project. The issue with having a summer project is many people can't decide if the project should be teacher-designed or student-designed. I believe the project should be teacher-designed because they know what knowledge the project should have for the students to learn, and they would know what projects would interest the students.

Some may argue and claim: the students would know better than the teachers on what interest them. Though, as everyone may probably know, some students don't always have the same interest as each other; for example, the athletic kids may not be into what the tech kids are into. So this task to pick a project for everyone may be be difficult for the students to figure out. On the other hand, teachers may have it easier figuring out what interest all or almost all of the students. Teachers could conduct surveys and have students fill out their interest, and the teachers can design the project based on the answers provided by the survey. Although, this method may not be entirely great for each individual student, it would be great for the majority of them.

Teachers would also know what specific knowledge they would include in the projects for their students. For example, they would know what is important for the student to learn from the project and what to remember from their previous school year, so they can take that information onto the next school year. While if the summer project was designed by students; they wouldn't know what's is important for them to learn or what previous knowledge to include. The knowledge that this project would contain is crucial to the learning and understanding of the students. This is something that possibly only teachers would be able to prepare correctly: for students this would be too much responsibility.

Though, seeing the side of the students wanting to design the project is very understandable. I understand that they feel as if they know themselves and their peers better than the teachers, so they would know what type of project would attract the other students. Students could also ask their teacher from the previous and the following year: what is beneficial and important for them to learn from the project. Although, it's better if the teachers were to design the project, that doesn't mean the students don't have the ability to do it.

Therefore, students can design the summer project if given the chance, but given the circumstances, it's better if the teachers would have the responsibility of designing it. Teachers just know what knowledge the project should contain for the students to learn, and they would know what type of project would interest the students. I've thoroughly explained why teachers would be the better candidate for this job, rather than the students.

Overall, what's important here is not who designs the project, but instead the project itself. This project determines what is valuable for the students to know before going into the following school year.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
A205C9872020,"Teachers should design the summer projects for a mulitude of reasons one being they know what was taught this year so they know what level the students are at, they know what the students will need to know for next year, and students tend to slack off during the summer and that would negatively affect the project.

The teachers know what level the students are at and they taught them what they already know. So the project would be specifically designed for them and what they already know. It would be a helpful review for those who tend to forget what they learned last year over the summer. Some of the classes that students take the next year are a build upon on what they learned the last year. For example, Algebra one is the basis for Algebra 2 so that information can not be forgotten. Having the teachers design not only will be a good review for the students. But it will also help prepare them for the following classes.

Whether it is because they also teach that class, or the class is a continuation of what was learned the following year, or they know about the subject of their own volition, or the next year teacher talked to them about it. Teachers know what students are going to be learning next year. So they would know best about what students should be learning about in the summer to get prepared. It is always nice to get a head start on what is going to be learned next year. The students can figure out what they are struggling with now and start researching it and practicing it now so that they don't struggle with it throughout the school year. They can start developing questions now for their teachers and start developing an interest in the subject. It not only helps the students but also the teachers. During the school year the teachers will be able to move more quickly through their curriculum because the students already have a understanding of it.

During the summer students sleep, eat, watch tv, and play outside in the heat. They don't come up with project designs. If they do it's losely put together and later in the summer. There should be a pre-designed project during the summer by the teachers. Not something students freely choose when they think of it. Plus it would take a chunk out of their working time to have to come up with a idea for a project, not everyone is creative enough to come up with a project, and procrastination will most likely occur espicially if students don't have a basis for the project. If they don't know the beginning they can't come up with the ending referring to the project.

The projects should be designed by teachers because they know the previous information learned by students, what the students will be learning next year, and students slack off in the summer because they want to relax. It has been proven that it not only would help students by decreasig their struggle with the information and so on. That it will also help the teachers next year by increasing the rate at which the information is blown through. Having the teachers design it will prepare students for the next year and give them a nice review from the last year. That is why teachers should design it because the have the tools to provide the following for students.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
960E34CEA228,"It is not uncommon for students to choose to enjoy their summer free of learning and homework. Be that as it may, it is also not uncommon for students to go into the beginning of each school year confused and somewhat out of touch from all the knowledge they absorbed the prior year. To prevent this shedding of information, schools will assign summer projects to keep students cognitively engaged and stimulated. Although having teachers design the specifics of the summer projects could be beneficial for overall learning and adherence to required curriculum, having students design their own projects with a general guideline from the teachers could help stimulate creativity and result in more engaged students outside of school.

Having teachers design a rigid summer project would, admittedly, be beneficial in the sense that students would be learning, and hopefully retaining, essential information which would aid them going into the next school year. Teachers can view the curriculum designated by the state, which has been deemed important for students to learn, and could therefore create something for students to do over break which adheres to those specific guidelines. However, the problem which arises with this type of memorization based learning is that students will be more likely to do the bare minimum required in order to receive a decent grade, rather than being genuinely engaged in the content which they are given. In the fast paced school environment, it is evident that the greater majority of students habitually choose to do what is required in order to receive a grade, and genuine learning is becoming increasingly rare. Therefore, for a summer project which has the goal of getting students to be stimulated outside of a school environment, having a rigid teacher designed project is not the most beneficial route for student engagement.

If students were to design their own projects based off of personal interests, tied into information which would be beneficial for them to retain over the summer, it would subsequently increase student participation and passion in learning the given content. It is interesting to note that the education system routinely enforces fact-based learning without real world application and context. While students are already outside of a regular school environment, encouraging creative learning and sparking interest in the world around them, and giving context to facts, would be overall beneficial for cognitive development and stimulus, and would in turn be better understood and retained in students' minds for the coming school year. It is true that students would likely still be competing for a decent grade; however, having students design their own means of acheiving that grade based off of a general guideline would promote more interest and effort in how they spend their break from school. Students must be given the opportunity to engage their interests in the real world while remaining mentally stimulated.

Allowing students to design personalized projects would help reduce cheating and sharing of answers, with each person working towards their own interest and ideas of how to combine learning with passion. All too often, students resort to sharing answers with others and utilizing Google to complete basic tasks assigned by teachers, stunting genuine thought and creative ideas. Students quickly become memorizing machines, absorbing facts without context, than attempting to understand a lesson which teachers try to convey. However, if students were given the opportunity to complete a summer project which did not require mindless repetition of information, and rather the creative implications of something which interests them tied into what they must retain over the summer, it would greatly reduce cheating and sharing of answers. While being mentally stimulated, each project would be unique to the individual completing it, making the mere idea of cheating become obsolete.

The current system of education often stamps down creativity and passion for learning, and students become more absorbed in the concept of receiving a grade than they are in retaining crucial information being taught. Over the summer, students will shed the information learned in the prior school year, once it is deemed as being useless or obsolete. Creative, student-led summer projects would aid in changing this narrative of memorization, and promote genuine mental stimulus which individuals can become passionate about, merely based off of the direction teachers want students to go in. Rigid, dictated summer projects would not be beneficial for overall growth and passion for learning, and would only continue to drive the education system to creating mindless students, rather than learners. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
08530C01BCFB,"Projects are another way to have fun while learning something new. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These summer projects should be student-designed, for they will help students gain creative skills and stay educated while being outside of school.

Firstly, students will gain creative skills. Working on a project will allow them to explore and use abilities they normally dont use. For example, a student can design a project and use different skills he or she didn't know they had. My sister had a big science project she had to create on her own. She came up with her own ideas and plans, such as, drawing pictures, creating an experiment, calculating the results, and putting together a chart about the experiment. Students can enjoy summer break while designing a project with many skills.

Secondly, students will stay educated while being out of school. One can learn new things on their own without being in a classroom. For example, he or she won't forget everything they've learned after school ends for summer break. Every summer I forget what I've learned and what I've been taught due to how much time I've spent out of school. It would be a pleasure to design a project and use many of my abilities I've gained while I was in school. Designing a projects has many benefits including gaining and using many skills.

However, some projects are as simple as folding a a paper air plane; one won't need a lot of skills. In addition to, some students want a break from education and have fun on summer break. Consequently, not everyone knows how to fold a paper airplane, but after one has learned how to fold a paper airplane, he or she has gained a new skill. Furthermore, students can still have fun while designing their own projects because it will be student-designed instead of teacher-designed.

In conclusion, these summer projects should be student-designed, for they will help students gain creative skills and stay educated while being outside of school. The way this issue could be impacted by my view is by, creating a project so that my creative abilities are not wasted and in a way, I can still learn something new. One can learn and still have during summer break just by designing a project.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
C06AB6F566C8,"During the school year, students are continually asked to complete assignments designed and evaluated by their teachers. Schools that assign their students projects during summer break do much the same. It is always teachers who choose course materials, set guidelines, and decide which subjects are worth learning. At the end of the summer, students return with half-hearted attempts at fulfilling their teachers' expectations. Since it is students who do the projects, why not let them decide what those projects should be?

Some might say that if students could design their own summer projects, they would do shoddy work or no work at all. However, if students are allowed to pursue their interests, they will be motivated to do their projects. For example, summer assignments in English often involve reading a book and doing a project designed by a teacher. Instead, many students read the Sparknotes page on the selected book and fumble through the project, having learned nothing at all. Letting students have choice would create an environment more conducive to real learning.

Giving students the opportunity for self-guided learning allows them to exercise their creativity in ways they typically can't during the school year and learn new skills. Students typically have more spare time during the summer, so a student willing to take on a large-scale project would have the time and energy to do so. For example, many students who compete in science fairs at the high school level often begin experimentation before the start of the school year. Working on a science fair project as a summer project could produce extraordinary results. A student with less academic interests could spend their summer learning a new skill, like how to cook. Either way, students would return to school having had valuable experiences.

The absence of strict guidelines would reduce stress. During the school year, students have many obligations, such as homework, sports, and jobs. For students who have fewer obligations during the summer, summer break is a welcome relief. For students who have to work or take care of family members during summer break, summer projects are an extra source of stress. For both, more flexibility with summer coursework would reduce overall stress and help them balance their responsibilities.

Letting students have more say in their summer coursework would be better for both students and teachers. Students would rather spend their time doing things that they care about, and teachers would rather not grade dozens of copperplate book reports.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
7F3E86846794,"A student's education is an ongoing process that is easily disrupted by long periods of intellectual idleness. So summer break, while revered by the student majority, ultimately has a detrimental effect on students' learning. To combat this, summer projects are commonly assigned to help students maintain their academic acuity and prepare them for the demands of their upcoming courses. Teachers know exactly which challenges their curriculums entail, so naturally, they're the safest option when it comes to designing these assignments. Their careers are centered around their ability to transmit knowledge to their students, making teachers the ideal (and obvious) candidates for summer project designing.

Summer work is seen by most students as the bane of their summer festivities, a teacher-spawned force that seeks to spoil all that their very necessary summer break stands for. This attitude, as with many opinions championed by the youth, is immature and not representative of the bigger picture. Teachers find the use of summer assignments an essential part of their scholarly arsenal because, by many accounts, summer break is simply too long. While the implementation of the year-round school year is a distant leap for American public education, summer assignments can provide relief for our current situation. Through summer work, a teacher of AP Calculus is able to ensure that their future students don't shed their mathematical foundations that other teachers worked so hard to build. Once classes reach a certain vigor, summer assignments simply must be used, similar to how architects insist on steel reinforcement once their designs are sufficiently structurally demanding.

Whereas teacher-designed summer projects are the reasonable norm, student-designed projects have been suggested as an alternative. This idea appeals to the short-term desires of most students; student-designed assignments will almost inevitably be less rigorous and lengthy than those manufactured by their teaching counterparts. Plus, having fellow students constructing summer work adds a less quantifiable layer of relatability. Yet, these benefits are proven to be only superficial upon closer inspection. Summer work made by students forces teachers to deal with the possibility that their new students will be utterly unprepared for their teaching. When the objective of summer assignments is to prepare students for their more rigorous and tedious classes, it's subtractive to think that lessening their work's intensity is fitting.

The one substantial benefit in student-designed summer assignments goes to the student designers, not to their student recipients. The designers receive their own assignment that requires them to think from the perspective of a teacher, a perspective that undeniably confirms students' understanding to a great degree. While a seemingly great concept for classwork, this benefit doesn't transfer well to those assigned the finished product over the summer. Students preparing for a course are subject to the volatility that comes with student design, and these assignments very well might not fit the planned curriculum.

Having students design summer work is quite comparable to having students teach a class itself. A teacher's purpose is to contribute the the shaping of a student's knowledge base, enabling them to be a productive member of society. Delegating this important job to other students, even if only periodically, is an ineffective and unprofessional way to get the job done. The designing of summer assignments, for the sake of students, should be reserved for those who get paid for doing so.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
D3BD101E28A4,"One topic that is frequently debated today is, if schools summer projects to assure their continue learning should be desingned by teachers or by students. Some people believe that for this type of projects students should choose on what they want. They feel that if students are going to do school work during their vacations they should at least let them pick on what they want to work on. I believe that teachers do a great job designing what is the best for students because teachers know what students need to practise more, if teachers make the projects for students they can be more motivated, and this can open more opportunities for students to learn more new things.

One reason why i think teacher should desinged summer projects for students is because teachers know on what students need more practice. The main thing for students during school is to keep learning new things. Teachers know students well enought to see what students need to get better at and on what they might need more practice. If teacher designed the projects could be more helpful for student and easy for them. In fact if teachers organized the project for students it could be more helpful for students to show their pesonal ideas.

Another reason why i think teacher should desinged summer projects for students is because that can motivate students. Students can also be motivated if teachers bring help to them in something that they will need in school and the future. Teachers also let students express their differents ideas and to become creative. If students desing their own project they will not focus on what they need to get better at. This can also help students to open their minds to learn more and to be confident.

My third and last reason why i think teachers should designed summer projects for students is because it can open more opportunities for students to learn more new things. Students will be able to manage more things that were complicated for them. This can oppen more opportunities for them and to become better in the future. Teachers will also bring help on what they need and to be prepare on what is coming after summer break. This will also keep their minds in the right path.

As you read, I believe that, teacher should designed summer projects for students because they know what students need to practise more, if teachers make the projects students can be more motivated and creative, and this can open more opportunities for students to learn more new things. From that day students will see that they were able to acomplish what they thought were not capable of doing.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
AC7E6B598391,"Summer projects given to students should be teacher designed.

Depending on the class that the project is for the student could have no idea what to make the project about.

It makes it easier to grade if every student has the same criteria and rubric.

The teacher would also have a good understanding of what the project is about.

Teachers designing the project would make more sense.

If a student is taking a class they have no idea about then they would not know what to base the project on.

Take chemistry for example.

The students taking the class could have no idea what chemistry is about.

If the teacher designed the project it would make it easier on the student to complete the project.

That student would know what to research and how to construct the project.

It makes it much easier on the students if they were given guidelines on what to do.

Having a teacher designed project would make it much more simple to grade.

If every student has the same project then the teacher could just use the same rubric every year.

For student designed projects there would have to be a new rubric created for each project.

When every student has the same criteria it makes it that much easier to grade all of the projects.

It makes it a lot easier on the students also to be able to look at the rubric.

That way they can base their projects off of the criteria on the rubric.

The teacher knows what the topic is about.

It does not matter if they're a math, history, science, English, or even a gym teacher.

They are the ones that knows most about their subject.

With them being the ones that know about the subject it would make it easier to create the project.

It makes it easier to get the ball rolling when they can tell the students what to base their projects on.

The teachers are the ones that went to college to get their degrees so they are the ones qualified to create the projects foundations.

It just makes the project easier because the teachers have a good understanding of the subject.

Ultimately teacher should design summer projects for students.

Students are not aware of what the class is about so they could not be able to construct an experiment.

Grading papers is a lot less complicated when there is a set rubric for the teacher to look off of.

The teacher is the one that knows what the subject is about so they should be the ones creating the project guidelines.

Teachers are the ones that have the qualifications to create summer projects.  ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
90C942265780,"When school is let out for the year students are free from learning, and other stressful projects. While this seems perfect for the students there are some repressions. When students get back into school from their freedom filled break they often are thrown right back into class with little left from the previous year. Seeing as this was an obvious problem schools came up with a solution to hopefully prevent students from being completely lost. Each student is required to complete a project over break, but the question is should the teachers be responsible of what the projects on, or should students be allowed to have a say in what they have to work on.

There are many benefits to allowing students to pick their own projects to do. Each make giving the students the power to chose very beneficial. For starters If students get to chose their topic then they will be more likely to do that project, because nothings worse than having to do a project over break without the freedom of doing it on something you like, or something your good at. Another benefit is that if students get to chose a topic they like than the overall quality of their work is bound to increase.

The second big benefit of letting students chose is that they may be inspired to seek out other forms of education. The ability to chose a topic may make students enjoy the project more. This could make the student eager to search for a group or organization that does classes and projects over the summer. in doing so the student may stumble across a topic or field that interests them. This could cause them to be eager to sign up for future classes when school starts back up again.

The final advantage to letting students pick their project is. The project the are made to do over summer will help them retain some knowledge that would most likely be lost during this vacation. While it may only be one subject from one class the chance of them forgetting that little bit of knowledge is very small. However, the biggest advantage this would give a student is that they would go into school with the skill and practice of working instead of starting off with a blank slate again.

As you can see it is important to let students pick their own topics. This will help with many useful skills while not really in school. As well as help inspire the students to began seeking out higher forms of additional education. That is why students should be given creative freedom when tasked with a over summer project.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
6173BAAAA7FD,"It's a hot summer day, ninety degree's outside to be exact, and you're swimming at the pool with your friends, enjoying your summer. When, all of a sudden, you realize you haven't started or even looked at your summer project. Luckily, you don't have to stress because your teacher already designed your summer project for you. Although some critics may believe that summer projects should be student-designed, I believe the contrary. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because student's don't have to stress about designing their projects, each student would have a unique project, and project ideas are already approved by the teacher.

First off, summer projects should be teacher-designed because it will alleviate students stress during their student holiday. Students are already stressed out during the school year and don't need to be stressed on their break from school. Designing a project can be very complex and coming up with an idea for a project is even harder. During my sophomore year of high school, my science fair group was required to design a project for the science fair. My group consisted of three girls and we couldn't think of any ideas on how to design our project. As the deadline for our project design approached, the more stressed we became. Eventually, we succeeded but I wouldn't dare to imagine designing the project over the summer. Teacher-designed summer projects are the superior option because it save students from stressing and worrying over their break.

Secondly, summer projects should be teacher-designed because no two students would have the same project. Summer projects should be one of a kind so students can learn while completing the project themselves. With adequate internet access today, students could easily go online and search up easy student-designed summer projects. By doing so, students could design the same project and not learn anything. In the fifth grade, my teacher instructed my class to design our own projects. My partner and I chose to design a solar system because we were learning about the solar system in class. When it came time to present our projects, we noticed that a few other students did the same project. Thus, summer projects should be teacher-designed because each student would have their own unique project.

Lastly, summer projects should be teacher-designed because project ideas would already be teacher approved. Summer projects should be age appropriate for the students because the main idea behind summer projects is for students to learn from them. If students designed their own summer projects, they could easily choose a simple idea to be free from the last burden of school so they can enjoy their summer. During my sophomore year of high school, my science teacher made sure that every topic was teacher approved to ensure that our science fair designs fit the criteria of a high school sophomore. By doing so, she guaranteed that everyone will learn from their project. Furthermore, summer projects should be teacher-designed because project ideas would be approved by the teacher, thus, ensuring that the project designs are not too easy and are equally challenging.

In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by the teacher because it would alleviate student stress, ensure that each student has their own specific project, and makes sure that each topic is appropriate. Summer projects should be fun and encourage students to learn over their break. They should not be a burden on every students shoulders and cause them to worry over their break from school. Summer projects should be teacher-designed to encourage students to continue their education even when they are not in school. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
52579F4BBE4E,"Most schools require students to complete a variety of projects during their summer break like reading books or completing a math packet. These projects help students continue their learning away from school, except the only difference is that they have all of summer to do it compared to having a due date within a week. Some projects prepare students for the upcoming school year while others act like reminders so that students won't forget what they learned in the past year. Though some believe that summer projects should be student-designed, others will argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed in order to get the best learning experience while away from school.

Summer projects should be designed by teachers because it will help students prepare for the upcoming school year. Some students may panic because they won't understand the new material or that they will fall behind in the class because they don't remember how solve a simple question, but if teachers design a project based on their class, it gives students an idea of what to expect. For example, a student will be taking Algebra 2 in the upcoming school year, but doesn't know anything about the class. A simple teacher-designed project that could help a student is a packet with math problems from every unit with examples that explains how to do it, so when students go back to school, they aren't completely blindsided by the new concept. Most schools, mainly high school and middle school, have reading assignments that students must complete before the school year. Reading projects could range from reading a certain book and writing an essay about it to completing a reading bingo where students have to complete a series of reading tasks of their choosing. Yes, the word project seem bland and a complete waste of time while students are on their break, but it doesn't have to be boring as long as it serves the purpose of helping students learn.

I can personally say that teacher-designed summer projects help prepare students for the upcoming school year. Once in middle school, there was a reading project assigned during the summer where students had to pick a book of their choosing that they can connect to and make notes on the side. I decided to choose a book about sports because as an athlete, I could relate to bits of the story. There were a few new things from the book that I learned about, so I wrote little notes on the pages and highlighted the text. After completing the project and returning to school, the teacher then told the class that the purpose of the project was to prepare for annotations, a concept new to students, and to help understand how to compare books that would be read throughout the school year.

Over the summer, students would forget the material they learned from the past school year, which makes it hard for them to pick up once back at school. Students also learn at different rates meaning that some are more advanced than others. These are another few reasons as to why summer projects should be teacher-designed. Teachers can design a project that helps them see where students are in their learning process and what they remember from past classes. For example, if a student takes a language, like Spanish, teachers can design a project where students must write a story in Spanish based on a given prompt. The project could include requirements that were taught from previous classes with some new concepts added in to see if an individual knows new concepts that will be taught in their future class. This will help teachers understand how they can help a student and where they stand in their learning process.

Although these are valid reasons as to why summer projects should be teacher-designed, others will disagree and believe that summer projects should be student-designed. The purpose of summer is so that students can take a break from all the stress that they have experienced during the school year, so a great way to learn and be stress free while doing so is a student-designed project. Students could be assigned a project for a class, but it could be of their choosing. For example, students could be assigned a project with no requirements where they have to make a presentation on anything that interests them, as long as there was a learning process. This will spark different ideas because all students have different backgrounds and their own interests like sports, cooking, or a job that they have. Though these topics are far from being similar, they all have a learning process. Since the project would be based on an individual's choice, it would be less stressful because it is something they are familiar with and know how to work around.

Yes, these are two very different sides with different opinions, but they both have a learning experience. Students still get the continuous learning process throughout their break while teachers can see where a student's learning capability is. Teacher-designed projects are stricter meaning that students would probably benefit from it more, while student-designed projects are less stressful based on a students choice. Even though most individuals would disagree saying that summer projects should be student-designed, teacher-designed projects are still the best option to get the best experience for learning new things and reviewing old material.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
A121A6B379B2,"Summer assignments are dreaded by students from any school almost anywhere. These long-paged, seemingly endless, and difficult assignments are planned and made by teachers and are given to students to complete and as a form of review for the students for the upcoming course. This review, for the students, is of utmost importance as it ensures the readiness level of the students for the course that they have enrolled themselves in. Teachers should plan and design the summer assignments because a teacher-designed assignment ensures the working standard and a level of difficulty that parallels the course-work, it also ensures that the material concurs with the curriculum of the class, and it is pushes students to have a motivation to do the work as repercussions of not doing it is very much possible.

Summer assignments need to have a standard of difficulty as the assignment is meant to build the student up for the difficulty of the course that they are enrolled in. By making these assignments teacher-designed they are more likely to be similar in difficulty to the course and the work given in that specific class. For example, a summer assignment designed by teachers for AP Biology may be more related to the difficulty of the course work. Whereas, one that is student designed may be easier and may take less effort to complete as students wish to not do certain assignments and make school easier whenever they can. This is however hurting them since the neglect in doing extra work can prohibit the student from being ready for the course.

Summer assignments are often designed by teachers to ensure that the material concurs with the course and the topics discussed throughout the year. This is very important as having a summer assignment that deals with nothing related to or discussed in the course can be of no use to anyone. By having it teacher-designed, the topics discussed throughout the year in class can be prepared for by completing the summer assignment. For example, if the summer project for AP Biology was student-designed it may include a review on neurons and brain structure, but the course or teacher may never touch on that topic at all, therefore, making the entire summer assignment a waste of time and energy.

Another benefit to having teachers design and make summer assignments is to have a certain motivation to complete the project/assignment. If the project was student made, students would not care enough to complete it as they don't see the long-term benefits to doing the assignment. However, if the assignment was teacher-made, the students have a responsibility of completing the assignment to ensuring a good grade in the class. This overlying fear of the teacher getting mad over uncompleted assignments pushes students to complete the assignment even though there is no one actively reminding them over the course of 2-3 months. This powerful fear of repercussions of not completing something is the same as in a job. If an employee was to ignore what the manager had set and stated, they may get fired. But if the employee is self-employed, productivity is low as they get easily distracted and there is no overlying factor to push them to complete certain things.

Some may say that having student-designed responses are important in fostering student growth and creativity. Yet this point is viewed incorrectly as having a student design the assignment may boost creativity in the short-term. But in the long-run it may hurt grades or lead to dropouts. This is the same principle of practice makes perfect. Without any review or practice of the material, the standard of the student is brought down. Creativity can be grown in many other forms such as art, game-design, and other forms. Having students design a summer project is more hurtful than beneficial to the student.

These feared, dreaded, neglected, and unwanted assignments are seen, universally, as the pain of summer. However when these assignments are given, they are intended to foster growth and ensure the retaining of useful information. While many may see them as the bane of their existence, these assignments are very beneficial for the student in the long run. These assignments are often teacher designed to ensure a working standard of difficulty, parallel the curriculum of the course, and to have an overlying motivation to complete the assignment. While some argue that these assignments should be student-designed, we should remind ourselves, young adult minds are very bad at looking at the long-term benefits of things and only see the short-term goods that are gifted. Is a failing grade in a college class worth the negligence that is given towards summer projects/assignment?",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
539B8000A428,"Many people believe that students should be given summer projects that are issued by their teachers. But others believe that students should be the ones to choose what they want to do for their summer projects, many reasons for this are because they will know what subjects they would need to work on over their summer brake.

Having the assignment designed and given to them by their teacher would give the student a chance improve in subject areas that they are struggling in. Studies show that many students have a subject area or class where they are struggling to do the assignments and worksheets given to them. The suumer project assigned to them by their teacher would help with fixing this issue and may even cause the student to become better at the same subject the followin school year.

This would also help prepare students for the next school year by giving students the opportunity to refresh their minds on the classes they took over the previous school year. Many times students come from summer break they completely forget what they have learnt the previos school year. This affects many teacher who have refresh their students memory on cetain topics they have been taught the previos school year. the time spent on refreshing students minds could be used to do smoething else like learning about a new topic in math, biologoy,health or chemistry class and giving more time to prepare for tests and SOLs. This would benifit both teachers and students in that more students would be understanding the topics they are being taught.

Giving students a summer assignment will also show the teacher what the student can accomplish on his/her's own. This how much progress the student has made on their own since the first moment they stepped in the teacher's class.

Teachers should be the ones whom design the summer projects to give students a chance to improve on certain subjects areas where they are struggling. Also giving them a refresher on the classes they took so that they can be ready for the next school year. Inturn this will also show what students can accomplish on their own.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
045020BFAD75,"Teacher-Designed or Student-Designed Summer Projects

Summer is a time for students to take a break and relax from school, but many classes are making students preform a summer project. Summer projects are given to students to allow them to continue learning even when not in school. The projects push students to work hard all year long. Summer projects are also easy ways for students to work hard and achieve a great score for classes. If a student does well on their summer project, then the teacher will recognize the student is committed and focused on school even when not in the classroom. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they will keep the students on task, push the students to learn, and will prepare students for future year long jobs.

A reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they will keep the students on task. On the other hand if the project was to be student-designed then students could easily be sent off track. There are a lot of summer activities that students would like to do, and if a student is only focused on fun activities then the student will not focus on the assigned project. The teacher-designed projects will keep the student on task and give them a way to work on the project but still be able to have fun during their summer break. Keeping the students on task is important and not allowing them to push the project off is a great reason why the teacher-designed project is a better idea.

Another reason explaining why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because it will push the student to learn. If the students are not learning anything from the project then there would be not reason why to have the project assigned to begin with. The students would learn a lot more if the project was made at a teacher standard because it would be just like a test or classwork, but made into a large project for the student. Learning from the project would be very beneficial for the student because they are given a whole summer to work on the project which allows them to learn the material at a slow and steady pace. This is a great reason why the summer project should be teacher-designed and not student-designed.

The last reason why the summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they will prepare the students for future year long jobs. Most jobs are year long and by giving the students the summer projects they are learning what it is it like to work year long. The students are basically going to be working all year long once they are given their summer projects. This is going to prepare them for what it is like to work all year long once they have a job. Even though the students are given a long time to work on the project, and will still have more of a break than a real job would allow, it is still a very good experience for the students. Many teens are hit hard when they leave school and enter into the workforce because school is much easier than a job. The reason just stated is a great example of why the teacher-designed project would be more beneficial to the students.

There are many of people that would agree with these statements above, but there would be opposers that would disagree. It is true that if the projects were student-designed then the students could work around their schedules to work on the project. That does seem very nice for the students, but there are many more advantages to the teacher-designed projects. Keeping the students on task, pushing the students to learn, and preparing students for future year long jobs are all reasons why summer projects should be teacher-designed. The projects that students receive now should be teacher-designed. This would make them much better for the students in so many great ways. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
403DC7E71F42,"Imagine the last few days of school when you're just about ready to enter summer break, but you remember that you have summer projects to do over the break. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they will continue learning during the break. Knowing they are school related projects, most are teacher-designed but since they're given to students over their summer break, they should be student-designed. Students could include their interests, in relation to some educational topics, and they would be most likely to do it. Projects over the summer seem like a waste of time and effort, but would that thought change if students created and designed them?

Summer projects could still be educational with involving the students likes and interests. Kids and teens around the same age have common interests, they know what they enjoy and what they don't. Since they have friends they were planning to spend time with, they could create group projects to complete them with and it would start to feel less like school work. Some students were probably looking forward to break and no school, but didn't have any big plans for the summer. The assignments could be a big help to those to enjoy and better their summer by having some sort of fun and enjoyment. With their interests and likes in mind, student-designed summer projects would encourage students to actually complete them. They could see something in the directions of the assignments that can potentially catch their attention. Most projects are a learning experience and there are some students who aren't good at paying attention or listening at school. While they're completing their projects, they could come to the realization that they enjoy learning new material and other school related things.

Although student-designed summer projects sounds like a good idea, teacher-designed projects could be a lot more beneficial. They could help us prepare for the next school year or grade level and give us a head start. Teachers include more useful information and content in their assignments and of course they know what is best for their students learning wise.

Closing my take on this position, I greatly believe that summer assignments should be student-designed. Teachers are the ones creating the projects now, but students are not enjoying or completing them. Teens and children could still be receiving their learning experience while involving their interests. It could also increase the amount of students completing their assignments. Teacher-designed summer projects could be a little more helpful; however, students deserve to enjoy and have fun on their break. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
204D7AB9CE39,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. Although having students design summer projects sounds like a good idea, teachers should design them because of their great knowledge and experience.

Teachers will always have more experience than students due to schooling, teaching, and past experiences as well. Experience is key to have while making the project because it will make the project more understandable for the student, rather than making it more difficult. If a student is given a project, and he or she doesn't comprehend what it is about, there is a very high chance that the student might not do it all, especially in the summer. Experience can also be helpful in this situation to set the expectation of how good the teachers want the project to be overall. Teachers also have to know what the student is capable and what the student is not capable of doing to make it possible for them. If a teacher was to give a normal tenth grade english student a twelfth grade AP course project that is college level, the probability of that student understanding it will be very slim.

The knowledge a teacher must have has to be enormous. The reason I say this is because students will always have questions about certain things, and teachers have to be able to answer them in an intelligent manner and put it in terms that the student will understand. Another reason why knowledge is important is it to create the project itself. Teachers must have the knowledge to create an assignment that is set to the standard of the class, has the sufficient workload and criteria for the student to comprehend, and the sufficient time for the assignment to be completed.

In conclusion, a student should be able to do an assignment with no problems whatsoever. A teacher would surpass the student in making an assignment for students. A student would make a decent assignment due to the lack of knowledge and experience, and teachers have a tremendous amount of those two qualities that makes them who they are.               ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
021B2E55384C,"Students should be able to design their own summer projects. I believe that summer projects assigned should be student designed because it would be more freeing to the students if they got to design their own project for the summer instead of a project designed by a teacher. This is a good thing because it's their summer vacation and that should give them the right to decide what project they want to do so they don't feel like the school is control of them even during their summer vacation which often represents the idea of freedom until the next school year begins.

My reasoning on this is because it's the students vacation; it would be more fair to the student that they get to design what their project should be so they don't feel like the school is still in charge of them and what they do even while they're on break. I also don't think it would be fair to the teachers either if they were the ones who had to design a project for their students and eventually get bored of grading them because things could get repetitive depending on what the project would be. Some evidence I have for this reasoning is that I know some students that would be stressed out greatly from teachers designing what the students are going to work on over the summer during their vacation; it doesn't matter if the project is difficult or not because they would purely be stressed about the fact that they have a teacher designed project to do over the summer which feels more like schoolwork to do over the summer and that isn't a fun thing to be thinking about over your vacation.

I also feel that parents would have complaints to make if their child was being assigned to a summer vacation project that was designed by teachers because that would give them the idea that teachers aren't giving enough freedom to their child over the summer. Though if it was their child designing their project I feel like parents would be more supportive of that because not only is their child still learning during break; but with the student being the one to design the project; that means that it gets the students' creativity flowing which I believe parents would be more supportive of then if teachers were the ones to design the project.

While I do know that there would be students and parents who would prefer that teachers would design the projects so the students wouldn't have to think so much about it and just do the project like a lifeless mind slave; I would have to argue back that not only would that cause a block on the students creativity, which is very important, but it would also mean that teachers would have to design a project for all of their students, which is a lot mind you, while trying to make sure that the project would be fitting for each one of their students and I think that's a problem that comes back to the fact that it just wouldn't be fair for teachers to have to do that; especially because they would already be having to grade them; so with the teachers also designing the projects, like I said before, that has a risk of things getting repeated and that could cause the teacher annoyance, a headache, sleep deprivation, etc.

I think that if summer projects were to be assigned then students should be the ones designing them. It would boost their creativity as well as their learning because they would be designing the project and doing research for it, It would make the majority of parents happier if they knew that their child wasn't using their summer vacation for completing a project that was designed by a teacher and not their child, and the teachers would be less stressed as well knowing that the outcome of letting students design their summer project would result in more diversity between what the projects were about and would more than likely contain less repetition than they would if the teachers were to design the summer project. It makes more sense to me that the student would be the one designing what project they're going to do during their summer vacation.     ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
AC5F232F9F99,"Some schools require summer projects to keep students learning over there summer break. Students should be allowed to design the project so they enjoy it more since the project takes place during summer break. These summer projects should be student designed because students will be more interested in the project, the grades will be higher, and it will make life easier on teachers.

If students are designing the project they must do over summer break then it will be on something interesting so they have more fun with it over summer. Student designed projects will be on a topic that interests them. Since the students have designed the project then they will enjoy more because they whatever topic it is on interesting. The interest on the project will also result in students handing in better work by the time summer comes to an end. Students will also enjoy working on this project a lot more if it is on something that interests them. Let's say student is working on the project and it is on a topic that is not interesting to them. That lack of interest on doing the project will result in worse grades and some students just not doing it. That is why students should get to design there own project over the summer, so the interest levels will be higher.

Another great reason the students should get to design is that the overall grades on this project will be higher.

It is very unlikely that students get a high grade on something that they didn't enjoy doing, which is why if students designed their own project then they will likely get a higher grade on it. For students working on something that is not enjoyable will result in a lack of effort and a worse grade. If the students got to pick there own project then they will enjoy working on it and will then get a better grade because they gave more effort. Coming up with their own project will also serve as extra motivation to get a good grade on the project. If students created there own project then they won't want to fail something that they made. That extra motivation to not fail something that they created will result in higher overall grades on the project. This another good reason as to why students should be allowed to create their own projects over the summer.

A third good reason as to why summer projects should be student made is that it will make life easier for the teachers. It is good for teachers if students make their own project because then teachers don't have to work late coming up with a project. If teachers are forced to work longer to come up with a project then it might not be that good. It won't be a good project because teachers will start to get tired which will result in errors on the project, which is why students should make their own project. students designing their own project will also give teachers extra time to do other things. while the students are coming up with ideas on what the project should be about teachers will have time to grade all the other work the students have. This will also remove the pressure off the teacher because instead of worrying about making a project they will be able to com up with better lesson plans and more fun stuff to do while school is still going on.

This is why students should get to make their own projects instead of teachers making it for them. These summer projects should be student designed because students will be more interested in the project, the grades will be higher, and it will make life easier on teachers.

ECD640058D57,"During Summer Break, Should they let students do their own kind of projects or teachers?

Students should do their own kind of projects because they can show they've learned over time and make it into a project where they show what they've learned. If it was teacher- designed, it wouldn't allow kids to express what they've been learning when the teacher is giving them instruction on what do. When kids show what they can do and put into a project, it shows that they've really payed attention and understood the lessons over the years. Also, the projects can allow students to reflect on what they learned and make something creative out of it.

My Friend Generic_Name, had to do a project over summer during middle school. Her teacher allowed them to do it on their own and see what they can do. At first, she was startled because she didn't know what to do. She asked me for help but i couldn't cause i was struggling as well on what to do. We started planning one day, and remembering what we've learned over the past year. The thing she remembered most was in her history class, her teacher taught her something valuable and it was "" You work hard enough, you can achieve anything in the world."" That stuck with her for 5 years and she still remembered it. So for her project she did something based on that quote. She designed a poster where it shows the quote and little pictures of each class and showing what she liked about it. In the end, She liked doing her own project without any instructions from her teacher. It made her think what she mostly remember from that year, and reflect on it. If she didn't have the confidence to do that, then who knows if she could've done it without her teacher's help.

My brother Generic_Name, when it was his last year of high school, his teacher made him do a project on what they have learned and remembered most out of their 4 years of high school. The thing he remembers most was his mechanical teacher having faith in him and telling him he could do it when no one believed in him. In his project, he made a poster based on his teacher and something he said "" You believe in yourself, you can accomplish anything what the world gives you."" During those 4 years, he struggled with school. He though he couldn't do it and he didn't even know what he was going to do after high school. But when he joined this mechanics class, he fell in loved with everything. All his time was invested into mechanics. His teacher saw potential in him when he first walked into class. Then one day, his teacher called him up and asked what he wants to do after high school, He had no answer because he didnt know what to do. So his gave him a opportunity to get an interview with this company he know and worked their before. And at first he was speechless, because no one in that school believed in him and thinks that he wouldn't do nothing with his life. So in the poster, he wrote a passage on why he fell in love with that class and he added pictures of him and his teacher working together. It showed that, with someones faith you can and you will achieve something great out of life. If no believed in him, then he wouldn't be working in that company that his teacher told him to join and he wouldnt be doing nothing in his life that he would've liked.

My Best Friend Generic_Name, had a teacher that liked her personality and the way she made people feel loved and included when no one wanted to. At the end of middle school, her teacher asked everyone to do a project. So for her project, she did it on one person which it was about her teacher. Her Spanish teacher, was strict on students but never lost faith in each student she had. But something about her made my friend and her have a connection. My friend has a mom that supports her in everything, but her Spanish teacher never had a kid. So my friend Generic_Name was like a daughter to her. She felt like she had a bond like her mom. Then one day for parent's night, Generic_Name's mom went to her Spanish class, and her teacher and her mom clicked away. They've became best friends out of no where. She was surprised because she didnt know if they would like each other or something she thought wouldn't work out. They've been friend's for 8 years already, and have so much in common. Her teacher was a person she can go for anything and without one question be afraid to tell her anything. So for her project, she did a poster of her mom and Spanish teacher. The connection they have, no one in the world could have that. Her Spanish teacher was important to her because she felt alone sometimes and had no one to talk to and she felt like she can go to her and talk about her problems with her. They have a bond she won't forget ever. She added pictures and saying thank you for everything for and nothing less. And for helping her in her rough days and making them somewhat better. If no one helped her in her bad times or no asked whats wrong, then who knows if she still be in school.

Although some might think, my friend Generic_Name, my brother Generic_Name, and my best friend Generic_Name. If they each didn't have a teacher who had faith in them who knows what they would be doing right now. They each had someone that cared and loved them when one wanna to. I think having that special someone can do wonders in life and help out a lot. So teachers should let their students do their own project without no instructions and let them rethink what they they have learned and make it into a project where they could lay out their ideas and make it into something wonderful.    ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
A885B3EA9C99,"When students are out of school for summer break, teachers have already created their curriculum to teach for the next school year. To prepare the students for next year, they could issue out a project over the summer for the student to complete; but over the summer, students could easily forget what they have to do and that could result in a failing project grade to start the school year. Now there is many factors into the student not completing the project, such as, not understanding the material, being occupied in other activities, and simply just forgetting what to do. how could a student solve that issue though? The teacher knows what could help the student next year, but this could possibly not even be on the students mind. This could be a new course that the student has not dealt with so how would you possibly go about it? Perhaps a different path could be taken and students could choose or design their own summer project for the summer. it could unlock the student's creativity if they choose how to work on it, also teachers can simply use this method to evaluate what the student is capable of so they know specifically what to target in the upcoming school year, making the teacher's workload easier. An additional benefit if the student is designing the project is that it could be more time friendly to them in their busy summer. Not every kid is genuinely busy and they have three months to complete one task, but in a student's young mind, it is unlikely that school is on it. there is an abundance of things that could happen to a kid in three months that is unbeknownst to the teacher, therefore, an ""one size fits all"" project may not be the correct approach.

Before summer starts, the school gives students opportunities to choose what courses to take for the next school year, and typically the classes the kids choose all have new material; So when the teachers give out these projects the student will most likely have no idea what they are going to be taught. that being said, a student designed project could help the teacher evaluate what the student is capable of so they can target strengths and struggles and build up off of them once school starts back up. For example, if a rising sophomore elects to take a course such as Pre-AP US History, and for the project the class has to write a five page essay on a current public figure, how would the class go about this? What if some students dont have a strong suit in writing? That would be very difficult for the student to finish. So what if instead the student has created the idea to make a twenty-five page booklet on an recent event in history? that could display the students creativity in illustrating rather than writing, and that way, struggle is eliminated and they earn a well grade showcasing the creativity they have. Now this is the best-case scenario, what could also happen is the student would not know how to make their project; If that is the case, then the teacher could maybe inspire the student by giving ideas and that way it is still the students choice on what to do.

Over the summer, kids have plenty of time and to do almost everything; which means they have plenty more opportunities for activities than when they were in school. Some kids get a job all summer, participate in travel sports, or could be making memories with family and friends. All of these could cause students to lose track of time and even forget about the task they are given. Some may complete it first thing summer starts, but realistically, not everyone would do that. A way that a student-designed project would help out with that is if it is their idea and they know how they would go about it, it could be a stress reliever and would be easily completed on their own time. That way, this will not be an obstacle to the student's plans or goals for the summer break.

For teachers, they are obviously more fond of the material than the students, But in the school year it may be difficult to help all students understand the material; So, if teachers can see what the student has trouble with in their project, they can pinpoint exactly how to help them. This is a great benefit for the whole class as this can solve all the struggles but more importantly this is easy for the teacher to help everyone succeed.

When projects are given out over the summer, there are plenty of factors that play into whether the student can finish or not. A student is dealing with other activities, or,there could be trouble understanding the new curriculum or the task. Whatever the case is, finishing a project is very difficult. But if the teacher enables the kids to create their own project, they could thrive by choosing their own method. The student could still face struggle creating their own assignment, but the teacher will find the best way to help them. If schools tested to see if student-based projects work over the summer, They could potentially see some positive effects.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
E3AE96BD6370,"Would you rather learn something your interested and passionate about, or be forced to learn by a set state, city, or county curriculum standard? Although the answer seems obvious, many school systems still debate over the topic of the summer project being in the student's hands or the teacher's every year. Having a student assigned summer project would be more beneficial to the student because it may lead to new discoveries, work would be done more efficiently, and could lead to new interest or career path.

Many might say that giving the choice of the projects to the students is a poor idea because they will choose the easiest, non-relevant, topics to work on, but that thought is incorrect. Giving the student the choice will cause them to choose a topic they are interested in and willing to work on, that even may not have been looked into before. For example-- The environmental study that found bird populations in the United States desert were decreasing jurassicly due to heat exhaustion was conducted as a summer college project. Without this amazing topic choice by the student, the study may not have ever been done. Environmentalist may have completely skipped over the fact that the bird population in the desert had almost decreased by 33% without this student chosen topic.

Most teachers believe that work only gets done if there is a grade to a project; that students will get off track if there is not set due dates. In most cases this is true, students will procrastinate their school work schedules because they are not interested in the study or topic that the teacher has chosen for them. This problem could be solved if the student was working on something he or she has chosen and is interested in. If the topic is something they are truly passionate about, the project no longer is done based on what's due and becomes focused on what the student has learned. He or she will probably do more work than expected before due dates because they will continue to research the topic and study due to their interest in it.

Giving the student the choice of the project may even spark new opportunities and choices for their future career path. The typical, boring, due date to due date summer project might be able to become useful in helping the student find what they like to study. If a student has never looked into the medical field before, and chooses a subject based on the human body. It may spark interest in the field of health services, physical therapy or nursing. This can not only be helpful for that one project but can inspire an entire career. With a teacher assigned project the student might never be able to experience this field and or find interest in it.

Having the student choose their summer project could make it more than just a project, it could be an opportunity to learn about themselves, what they want to do in the future and explore new territories in what they can study. The choice can change the mood of the project from ""Oh no"" to ""Oh yes"" and make that uninteresting summer project, a big step in life. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
824DAEDF9E75,"Summer projects should be student-designed, and heres why. Summer break is a students way of relaxing and getting away from all the stress of school. Without summer break, it would be a nightmare for them. Although summer is a getaway from work and school, the kids should still have somewhat of an educational recap to prepare them for their next challenging year. As student progress throughout the years, school gets harder and harder. Without summer assignments, students would struggle trying to remember where they left off. This is why it is important to give them something during summer break to make their next school year a bit easier on them.

Children aren't so fond of the idea of summer assignments, but they don't understand the benefits. If summer assignments are student-designed, it will create a fun but educational way of learning. If a child is given the opportunity to do whatever they want for a school project, then they won't just enjoy it, but it will make their project just that much better. If someone is excited and dedicated towards something, it will make all the difference.

Student-designed assignments give the kids an opportunity to showcase their interests. For example, a student might be really interested in science and want to do an experiment on plant growth throughout the summer. Another studnet might love history and want to do research on a certain subject that they are interested in. Maybe a student is fantastic at writing essays. The kids get a chance to work on something they love and still have a fun summer break. It rids students of all the stress of having to finish a difficult and boring assigment during their summer.

Families love to travel and get away from their home during the months their kids have off of school. Some families even leave the country. Teachers have no control over what their students do during break, but they do have control over what kind of summer projects to assign their students. Student-designed projects don't take away the enjoyment of summer break. The kids can travel, have fun, and still get a wonderful project done. Difficult and stressful summer assigments are unnecessary.

Summer break is a way for kids to get out of that stressful environment called school. Even though they have to be given summer assignments, doesn't mean that their summer should be taken away from them. There are ways to lets students relax and still get an education during summer. That is why teachers should give out student-designed projects during the summer. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
D9969B1F3A15,"In reality a student-designed summer project could never work. It would lead to the teacher grading several vastly different assignments about the same subject, and this is assuming all the students would even do their own project. A teacher-designed project is better because it is guaranteed to include all the material the students have learned and provide a properly structured assignment that reinforces what is learned in the classroom, while lowering a teacher's workload.

Teacher-Designed projects is a better idea, because they are guaranteed to include all material that has been taught during class. This is due to the fact that most teachers have a plan for what is taught each day and keep a record on a computer or physical calendar. Meanwhile, at the end of one unit most students will forget what is taught at the beginning of that same unit. At the same time the majority of students aren't organized, so any previous notes or assignments that could help a student create their own project have been lost.

Another reason is teacher-designed projects provide a properly structured assignment that reinforces what is taught in the classroom. It is only natural that the person who has extensive knowledge on the material and leads the class be the one to create the assignment. If a student were to make the assignment it would consist of simple questions with answers that can be looked up on Google. However, a teacher has the knowledge and experience to make the student use critical thinking skills and devise their own answers

The most important point is that it would be less work for a teacher to grade an assignment made by him/her.

Considering that most teachers have over two-hundred different students is baffling in of itself. Imagine taking an hour of your day to grade two-hundred of the same assignment with an answer key almost everyday. Now imagine grading two-hundred vastly different assignments with no answer key. Then add that to fact that school has started again which means even more assignments. This is just to much for one person to handle and could lead to mounds of stress.

Overall, a teacher-designed summer project would result in a better understanding of the subject and a teacher that isn't overwhelmed by the amount of assignments. Meanwhile, a student-designed project would leave everyone misinformed or with a zero on the project. Whoever came up with this idea needs to reevaluate how responsible they think teenagers are.                       ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
9556E99B95DE,"Summer break is a time where all students of all ages long to enjoy the warm weather and the absence of school work.

Although for some schools the absence of work during the summer is not the case. An essential part of the education process is to broaden horizons on topics that we aren't familiar with.

Which is why requiring students to participate in summer projects is an excellent objective to strengthen young minds for the upcoming year's curriculum. Ultimately, a teacher-designed summer project would be the best initiative to strengthen knowledge on a particular subject and overall grant a higher success rate.

A teacher-designed summer project would go as smooth as the driven snow.

A highly educated teacher with either a Bachelor's or Master's degree in education would fully know the required curriculum despite, which grade level is in question.

A teacher-designed project would also take out any stress and anxiety that a student-designed project could have; however, with stress and anxiety present a student-designed project could potentially lead to mental health issues.

Children in today's society deal with enough heartache and pain that most of us couldn't even bare to imagine.

Therefore, a teacher-designed student project would be the best decision to positively impact learning and preserve our children as long as we can.

Opponents may argue that a student-designed project would give students a way to be more independent, as well as, responsible.

They feel that a student-designed project is the best alternative and rebuff the consequences that might follow.

However, a teacher-designed project removes all burden that a student-designed project could offer.

It gives students the opportunity to still be kids and to enjoy their summer break without the hassle of trying to ponder on any such topic.

Therefore, the argument is perishable due to the amount of heartache and potential stress that a student-designed project could adhere to; which, is not the objective.

A teacher-designed project is a way to increase student learning and to keep young minds alive during the summer months.

Thankfully, a teacher-designed student project would take out any detrimental mental health issues that could lead to disastrous affects. Our children today are faced with more trials and tribulations rather than triumphs.

Could we at least take one less burden away?

Opponents argue that student-designed projects lead to increased responsibility and maturity, which gives children a sense of independence.

However, children typically do not have the drive to complete school work during the off months.

Overall, a teacher-designed summer project is the best alternative because our children are only young once and one day their summer breaks will cease to an end.

Therefore, the lack of stress and anxiety can impact many but it may be one student's safe haven.       ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
8D8BF05B7936,"The break between school years is a time for students to prepare themselves for the year to come. It can be inferred that children tend to put school in the back of their mind during this period. This is understandable but middle and high school students continue to learn: this is with the help of various projects and work given to students to work on during their break. The summer reading projects that are given to most grades keep the mind in a working state allowing for the transition between school years to be easier for students and teachers. Student-designed projects are more favorable to teacher-designed projects because it allows for the student to be creative as well as coming across as mature and responsible.

Creativity is a characteristic, which is more often then now, seen to be taught and picked up on at young ages. Of course, there is high school art classes or projects in general given to children during the year to get their creative minds working. Most of the time though, the projects given are somewhat limited in how they can appear or the topic of what the project is based on because they are most likely teacher designed. As a matter of fact, certain school classes have more projects than others, but there is not a lot of student-designed work. As for summer reading projects, the Ã¡Âºâo-dÃÂ¶ list is often restricted to a handful of books then the students have to look a little past the words to get a deeper meaning behind the lines for a finished project. Giving school attendees a project that gives them full control over the design, the final product, and how the project is presented can really boost the studentÃâº summer. The creativity that would be provided can really improve a studentÃâº summer as a whole.

Maturity and responsibility come with age. This is often tested a lot during apersonÃâº life, and it can be tested during school as well to see how far a child is progressing. Summer projects are given to keep the children working during the summer. There are many reasons why this is true, but some students do not want to think during summer. Giving this type of student a teacher-designed project can allow them to breeze past the summer project. Therefore, not benefiting them in any way, shape or form. Giving out a student-designed project needs more brain power to actually become a finished product. The responsibility given to students with a project ran by them can separate the more mature children of the bunch and the lesser half. Being able to finish a school project during the summer takes dedication, but involves a lot more accountability and maturity to complete a project created, thought out, and produced by them.

The creativity and responsibility needed to finish a project designed by the student given the project, by far, surpasses the benefits of a teacher-designed summer project. Both of these projects are given over the summer to keep students learning during summer break, but teacher-designed projects are often favored. This is because the work given usually pertains to the curriculum to get the studentÃâº prepared for the year to come. However, it is much superior to give a student the opportunity to show how mature they can be, how responsible they are, and also show how well their mind works by itself: creativity. It is clear which choice is better for the student to keep their mind up: having them design their own project, but it will only take time to see when student-designed summer projects will be implemented into various school systems around the globe. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
B5A5CFDCE29E,"Some schools require students to complete projects to assure they continue learning during break. Should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?. I think these projects should be teacher-designed because in my opinion it would be better and it would actually help them more. By the teacher designing it, it means she/he is giving them the information on what they should be working on. By them giving the information students can or will find it easy to do and finish them fast so they can have the rest of the summer for them.

Summer projects designed by teachers in my opinion it would help students to learn more and not forget what they have learned about. Teachers who designed these projects should give each student to work on a target they have struggle with or did not understand. Teachers should designed summer projects that could be work with other people, they should make it fun. Summer projects should be fun but yet the students can still be learning. Projects do not have to be boring all the time. They should make it about getting up,doing some movements. When students are doing these projects they should be walking, running, laughing, talking, and working with one another. If teachers make these summer projects boring students may want to do them. Is also their summer where they have fun, where they go to vacations with their families, where they go to the pool, the beach. Summer is basically their free time, their free month, no school.

By assigning these projects to students is going to help them to not forget the information they learned about and also to learn new information. For example, when I go to summer break or any other break and come back to school after that break or whatever break it would be I would and still not remember a thing, all the information I learned about would be gone yeah there used to be some stuff that I still will remember but most of it will be gone. In math class we would start a target; when the teacher would be teaching us a target she will be like ""You guys should know this information already from last year"". In my head I would be like ""uhhhh.. no,no,no ma'am I do not remember this; how was I going to remember this!"". I would honestly not like having work over the summer because for me summer should be school free and homework free, eventhough; I think is really helpful but I do not think is for me. If I ever get to do something like that I think I would do it but if it brings something fun for example, the ones that do most projects could win something, they should make it exciting.

Summer projects, yes absolutely they can be really helpful. These projects can help students a lot. These projects can help students by remembering things they have learned about, also by learning and gathering new information in their heads. By making these projects fun of course students would love to do them. Teachers do not give students something boring to learn about because they are not going to do it. By making it boring students would get bored fast. So teachers make these summer projects fun. I really think these projects would be more helpful being teacher-designed.                           ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
CC059B14457A,"When summer break starts most students only think about the fun they are going to have over those 3 months. They don't think about learning or gaining knowledge over this period of time. In addition, students forget what they have learned over the course of the long school year. A great way for students to learn while on summer break is to be assigned summer projects. These projects should be teacher designed because teachers can challenge their students and ensure that they are retaining the information for the next school year.

Although, students can be creative in making summer projects for themselves, teachers are better equipped for this task. A teacher makes lesson plans all year so students can learn and pass semester exams. Summer projects can be a cool and fun way to learn. For example, students can create a big poster or PowerPoint displaying all of the things they have learned in school that year. If a student were to create a summer project then they might take it easy on themselves instead of doing something challenging. However, a teacher will give their students a challenge so they can think and problem solve.

Each year students learn the same thing that they learned the previous year, however, they build on what they have learned. This is why it's important for students to stimulate their brains over the summer so the information is not lost or forgotten. If teachers assigned projects to students over the summer then they would have information fresh on their brains ready to use next year.

Consequently, summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers can challenge their students and ensure that they are retaining the information for the next school year. These projects are a great way for students to learn and grow over the summer instead of playing video games.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
9A0FC2A17891,"Summer assignments have been used by teachers and most educators to keep the students mind flowing through the summer. Students creating the projects for themselves is not a good thing, they can make it as easy as they want,therefore, students do not get the proper knowledge. The system of summer projects is the best it can be when the teachers choose the project for the students.

Teachers jobs are to work with every student and give them assignments to help them grow and prosper, what is the point of paying a teacher if they are not going to give the projects. Students may think they know what they should do, the teachers are with them and watching them almost every day trying to taylor the material to every student. Summer projects are meant for the students to stay sharp and ready for the school year to come,consequently, students making there own projects would not be in the best interest of themselves because they do not know what kind sort of work there will ne next school year. The teacher can prepare you with a project of there choice, teachers know what is best for their students. Teachers also have to make sure the project isnt too big or too small for the amount of time the students are on summer break.

Most students would think the project is important because they pick it themselves. No one wants to be doing school work during there break, if the student chooses the project there is more incentive to not do it. Summer vacation is about 3 months long, a teenagers brain will forget many things over the span of 3 months,therefore, teachers watch carefully and pick a project that will help everyone remember something important for next year. Teachers can also make more elaborate and fun projects, instead of doing a simple poster board or power point that the student would likely choose and do something in the community. For example,a teacher wants her class to stay up to date on there economics during the summer, but she knows she must design them because her class would just make essays and slideshows, she wanted more for her students not just writing and researching.

Students designing summer projects could help students express creativity and make them feel free to make there own decisions with their project. Students could pick a project that would help them individually, instead of pick one project for everyone, that might help some kids but some others may want to do there own thing. The student can make the project fit into there schedule, summer is a busy time for everyone and some people will no have time to do a huge project over there break. Students creating there projects would lower stress because they would be doing a project on somthing they like and that could get more people to get it done over the summer.

In conclusion, students should not be designing there own summer projects because they could choose a really easy project just so they can get it over with and that ruins the purpose of the summer project. Also, teachers know what there students should remember for the next year and what will keep there brains thinking through the summer, students should trust their teacher and expect a challenge to keep the brain active.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
D2F5E24CEEAA,"Summer break is typically a period of time where you can take a break from school and work and be relieved from all sorts of stress. But some schools assign students to complete summer projects to provide them continuous learning over the three month period time of being absent from school. The projects can either be teacher-designed or student-designed, which one should be assigned to the students? although both sides can be debatable student-designed projects might be less difficult I believe that it should be student based because the project would still complete its targeted goal and still help students have continuous learning over break.

Summer time is the time when most of us are outside making plans, meeting family, going around the world, and even just relaxing without any problems from the world. Summer break was made to help our brains take a time off of work, school, and stress. But even when we are on a break there is always something we need to do or can do that will help us have that continuous brain activity so when we are back from break we did not lose all of our knowledge and working habits and can hop right back into learning and working. But the work can be kept to a minimum and still have us have that constant brain flow and typically teachers dont understand that for students.

When assigning work to students over break, teachers normally would base the work and projects on how much time we have. If all the work would all be teacher-designed, they would see it like; the longer the break would be the more difficult and longer the assignments or projects should be. That would not be too fair for the students that deserve the break after having 9 months of constant learning and hard work in school. Also If the projects were to be teacher-designed it would not be fair to even the parents that are on break too because they have to stay at home and wait for their child to finish the work before starting their summer vacation or their family activities.

The purpose of the work over breaks is understandable, to ensure that we do not lose our knowledge and keep our brain working so when we go back to work it would be easier to get into learning and working as soon as possible. But the work can also be easier but can target he same objectives, this can be obtained if it were a student-designed project. Students know their limits and the targets for the projects so students can personally complete their own tasks and get the work done at their own pace. It would be way less stressful if students didnt have to base how much work they get done how they do the work by another persons standards that does not know what other things the student has to do in his or her life.

All in all summer is a period of time to be stress free but it can also affect our learning and working habits. But we still do need something to challenge our brain to keep those habits and students should be able to control how they do that. The work and their projects over break should be student-designed and not teacher-designed because we can keep the work to a minimum based on our schedule while still targeting the same objectives the teachers would want us to accomplish and both the students and teachers would both get what they want. The students get their break with minimum work and the teachers still get to know our brains are getting challenged.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

Are summer projects better design by students or teachers. Summer projects should be design by teachers because they know the content they will give us, the right exercises to work on and will help us with next year school material.

The content of every subject is important to understand, it also depends on which material they are working on. Lets say; for example, in English class the section design by the teacher will be easier to understand because the teacher will put all the information, the students need to remember for next school year or later on in their future. A teacher will always want to make sure of the students learning, besides all the material they need to know will be better organized and clearer. Scientifically they say the more you read, the human brain gains more knowledge and it will help the students grow on their vocabularies. The information is believable if the teacher gives students notes for their test if its searched online it would probably other type of writing.

When it comes to homework a teacher will look for better exercises for her students to work on and for them to accomplish them. In math the more exercises the teacher will give, the better chance the students have at learning and figuring out the problems, students that work on their summer projects and listen to what the teachers say have batter chance on have a better chance to have better grades in next school year. There is famous quote saying ""practice makes perfect"". For example one good example would be Helen Keller she was deaf and mute but later on her life she learned an practiced every day to read and write. she became a phenomenal person and writer.

Since technology has grown over the past few years teachers can now recommend students to watch videos like Khan academy for math to learn how to solve problems for next year, although for some classes they give light projects for students to do in groups, instructions are very needed and that is why its better for teachers to design summer projects. In Generic_School students an also try to practice in school or out of school. Direction are very important for teacher in school year when taking test, students dont see the directions and tend to ask teachers. The teachers will then give them examples to work on home and also how to read test questions.

However, some students may not agree with this position because either school projects take all their time and later on they would be bragging about how they didnt have a fun summer or some simply cant understand what the teacher is trying to express in a word problem or cant figure out what the question is saying. some kids in this world have different ways of learning and a teacher should figure that out some learn visually others by just hearing etc. other students are just to tired.

This is why Summer projects should be design by teachers because they will give the necessary information for a student to learn and to practice from it from home. Also these students should have summer projects to refresh their memories.

Summer projects are good for students an they should work on them and not be lazy, if they do their project the can have a better summer and finish with their task and be relived also summer projects are far better design by their teachers because kids have more advantage to learn from and to keep practicing     ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
91A7412303BD,"85 percent of students who have created their own projects have better grades! Yet, Getting students to complete an summer assignment can be nearly impossible so, allowing students to design their own summer project would be more ideal. Now, allowing students to design summer projects is so great because students will have a better understanding which will increase the outcome of student completion while also giving students the opportunity to be self-paced in their work ethic.

When students are given any project their is a deadline that they must have the project done before which can be overwhelming and stressful which is a take-away from enjoying a project not being based on any subject of learning. In addition to that when you are in control of your work you feel more relaxed because you know everything that is needed to be done without stress of someone just giving you a project, instructing you, and announcing a deadline.

However you can argue that not everyone agrees although it is a study proven students and children work better to get tasks done while being self-paced. For example, imagine going to work being told you have to do an presentation on the process of water filtration beginning with research you start but then you are told the project is due Friday and the day you were told is Wednesday, Now you have little time and no comprehension on the process of water filtration.

Leading to my next point comprehension of information you know little to nothing about is often But, in my experience and understanding projects are a fun more exciting way to learn a subject and should be. Although it is not because being taught is one thing but not being able to say for a fact you understand thoroughly is another. When having a class it is known students will ask for help but still not get the help they need because of lack of comprehension due to the explanation.

As being a student myself I will ask an peer to explain in a different way so I am able to know and thoroughly understand, being students there are a lot that we may not understand all because of how it was presented and the teachings of a teacher. Reading and knowing that comprehension and pressure are what teacher add to students when assigning projects is more of a reason to allow students the access of designing their own project on their own term and conditions including time. Students just as teachers have lives that we can't control when things happen we just have to get things done and self-paced work ethic allows student a high chance to being focused and confident in being able to do work no matter the subject.

In conclusion, students should be able and allowed to design thei own projects and work no matter the time of being in school or out of school it gives a greater chance at completion without a demand and confusion stuck on each students mind. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
18AA02D4AF36,"Summer break is the time for students to relax and enjoy themselves without the stress to complete work and assignments, but the time might also lead them to forget what was taught to them. During summer break, students will forget what was taught to them in the the school year with no assignments, homework, and projects; and students will rarely ever care to do work themselves. Teachers should design summer projects to students. Projects should be designed by teachers because they know what students struggle on and what appeals to them, they know what students will face in their next year of school, and if students were given the choice to create their own project they will be lazy and sloppy with it.

However, a common argument against this idea is that students will make a project that interests them and will benefit them more. A teacher might not know what the student likes and needs to focus on whereas the student will know exactly what they want. To chalenge this idea, students likely not care due to it being summer break, and teachers who have worked with students can know their flaws and weaknesses that a student might not know about themselves. Due to this reason, students should not be the ones who determine how they design their summer project.

Teachers should design the projects because the teachers will know what can appeal and help a student. A student may not know where they struggle and will have a hard time to create a project that they need to complete. Teachers would have worked with students and know where they should focus on and what that student might like. Therefor, Teachers should design a summer project that can help students.

Teachers will know what things rising students will work and struggle on where students cannot. When students go to the next grade, they might not know what they will be working with and how to do it. Teachers will know what classes a student will take and can create a project that will chalenge and help prepare the student to what they might face in school. Teachers have also worked with the students and know where their weakpoints are and can design the project that can strengthen them in that area. That is why having teachers design the work will help the student in the future.

Teachers should design the tasks and projects for students because students can be lazy and sloppy with their project. If a student were to create their own project, they might not care much for it and not do it well or not even do it at all. In the summer, students will most likely be ""too"" preocupied with friends, fun, and maybe a job if they work; when a student feels that they are ""too"" busy they might put off the work, complete it very sloppily, or complete it too fast. Consequently, teachers should the the designers of the summer projects to students due to some students lazy or careless habits.

Teachers should be the determining factor for creating students' summer projects because teachers know what appeals to a student's interests and struggles, teachers can design the projects to prepare students for their next year of school, and teachers will not be lazy or sloppy when it comes to designing summer projects unlike some students. Therefor, teachers should be the ones to design a project for students to complete over the summer.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
303FCCA4B05F,"Every summer students are assigned projects that can be boring and hard to complete. A large number of the schools that require students to complete these projects have teachers design them. Some believe teachers designing summer projects is the best option for students; however, this is not true. Although some may disagree, summer projects should be student-designed.

There are multiple reasons summer projects should be student-designed. Every student has a different way they spend their summer break. An option that could benefit students would be one catering towards their events throughout their summer vacation. Students having a project about what they specifically participated in over the break could make the project more authentic. Many students have different summer vacation schedules. Some students may relax in their bedroom and play video games all summer; on the other hand, there are students who live for the summer. Students who live for the summer could perhaps visit: beaches, amusement parks, music festivals, perhaps even other countries. Along with what students do in their free time many teens start summer jobs which can also take up a good amount of time. A student-designed project would be easier on students because it'd work in their favor as well as be completed on their schedule. Each individual student has a different way of completing work. Certain teacher-designed projects may not be catered towards a students preferred method of working. Some students may like to write essays or create posters, while some may like to make video montages or create other types of projects. Student-designed projects would give students the best opportunity to create something showing off how they like to work.

There are additional reasons why summer projects should be designed by students. If students designed their own projects they'd be more motivated to finish them. Since students would make their own project's the work would be more engaging and exciting. A goal one makes for themselves is wanted to be achieved more than a goal set by others. A student-designed summer project would be easier to complete. Teacher-designed assignments can often be confusing or difficult, driving students away from completing these assignments. However, if a student designs their project they'll know how and what to include making it easier to complete. Students have young, developing, as well as creative brains. Their minds would allow them to design their own projects, leaving the door open for unique work to be done. Creative projects being done in the summer turn on both sides of a students mind having logical and artistic work be done. If students engage both sides of their brain throughout summer break it puts them in a good spot to return to their school in the fall.

Although some may disagree, summer break projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects allow students to show:creativity, time management and the ability to work with busy schedules, self-motivation to complete their assignments, along with other benefits. Still some believe summer projects should be teacher-designed; however, this is not true. Summer projects being student-designed would be beneficial to students and open up many possibilities for their work to be its best over the break.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
61055119521E,"Learning is a skill that takes practice and experience to become better at. Allowing students to control their learning could encourage them to want to work harder and make their work better. Students do not often have creative capacity in the school system and are often fed information and asked to repeat it during an exam. Connecting this information with real world projects and concepts will benefit students beyond their years in the school system. Summer projects should be student designed because it allows for intrinsic learning as well as independent thinking which results in internal motivation to complete and excel in summer projects.

Allowing students to design their own summer projects allows children to be proactive in their learning because they are doing a project they feel passionate about. When children design their own work they feel pride in the outcome which would cause the child to spend more time and effort completing the assignment. Children are very passionate and when they have teacher assigning homework all year that they are required to complete, a self designed summer project would give them a sense of freedom and independence they have not experienced. This intrinsic learning is based on their internal desire to the project they designed; if they created it, they are more likely to complete it. They are given a choice, which is not a common thing in the school system. Giving these children a choice makes them feel like they are doing something different and more important which will result in a better product at the end of the summer.

Independent thinking is a skill development when giving a student creative freedom during a summer project. In long term schooling young adults need the skill of coming up with their own Science Research Projects which requires this independent thinking. Starting this from and early age gives the child the skills they need to succeed in higher level schooling. Allowing children to start their schooling with experience doing independent, self designed projects gives them a head start in this area. Independent thinking is required in professional work after schooling, so building this skill is vital. Small projects over the summer give students a chance to exercise this way of thinking but also experience the process of designing and completing a project without teacher intervention.

When teachers design student work they are looking for specific answers to mark correct or incorrect. Teachers give a format and outline to students and expects that all the students come back from summer with the same answers. This takes away the creativity in schooling and limits the thinking required to problem solve. Teacher designed projects have an outcome that should be the same among every student, so each student is finding a solution to a problem. If the student creates the problem and has to come up with their own solution to the problem they are able to develop the skill of not only solving problems but finding them as well. The skill of finding a problem and making a solution is an important skill in professional work and is an advantage over other children. Teachers giving the creative responsibility to the students gives a child a sense of pride and desire to impress the teacher and show them what they are capable of doing.

Intrinsic learning as well as independent thinking are examples of why summer projects should be student based and result in internal motivation to excel and complete summer projects. Society should emphasize the importance of having passion and an internal drive to excel in everything they do. Student designed summer projects allow the students to practice having the internal motivation to do well on their summer assignment and feel passionate about the project they designed. It gives the child a chance to specialize in an area they feel passionate about which will result in more complete, well focused work; but more importantly a learning experience that can not be simulated by a teacher. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
4A19D1B57BC4,"Summer break can be a time of rest and rejuvenation for many students. For others, it can be a time of learning and preparing for the next school year. This summer learning can come in the form of a project that is to be completed throughout the summer. Summer projects should be created by the students to give them control and independence, to promote creativity, and to cut down on copying and cheating.

First, students should be assigned a personally designed project to allow them to choose when, where, and how they can complete it. Many benefits can come out of giving students full control over a project. For example, a teacher could see a higher percentage of students complete a personally-designed project compared to a project that was teacher-designed because students can create the project around their schedule. Students would be given the choice of the topic of their project, as long as it relates to the class or subject . Students respond very well to being given control over a large project because it fulfills a need for independence.

A student designed project can also promote creativity and problem solving skills. Giving students the creative choice means they will have to chose not only their topic, but how they will research, put together, and present their findings. By giving this choice, students can be more engaged and their interest in the project will peak. From many experiences, a project with hard-set rules is usually less engaging and much harder for some students. The students can design their project to fit their learning style, rather than the teacher's. Students will be much more engaged and willing to do a project if they are allowed to add their own creative spin.

Finally, a student-designed project can help minimize copying and cheating. By giving students the choice of their topic, the students will most likely all chose a different subject. A student seeking to copy another would be out of luck because the teacher could identify similar projects. If students were given a packet full of questions or a rule filled project, it would be easy enough to search for the answers on the internet or do the project with a friend. A student-designed project can ensure that everyone will do their own work.

Although a student-designed summer project does have it's downsides, like difficultly of grading on the teacher's part and the need for very high effort on the student's, it is a better option. Summer projects created by students can give the student independence over the project, promote creativity and problem solving, and minimize cheating.  ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8

Summer projects are made for the students to assure that they continue to learn during their break from school, but the real question is, should the projects be designed by students? Or should they be designed by teachers? In my opinion I believe that if the project was student designed, there would be a lot more creativity and will to want to finish the project. If the teacher decides that they will give the students a prompt, it could result in students losing interest in the project and not ending up finishing it. From my past I have realized that I have worked harder as ever when it was something I was passionate about. A student-designed project could ignite that passion for some students.

Summer break is a beautiful thing, warm weather, clear skies, pools opened up, and three months without school! The idea of a teacher-designed summer project could upset a lot of students, but if it was a student-designed project the task would be much easier to complete. Keeping the brains active for the students so they're ready for when school starts up back again is a major deal, the idea of a summer project not only keeps the students thinking, but allows them to work on something that could be meaningful to them. Allowing them to design their own projects means they make something that they personally care about, something that they will ultimately put their all into to get that good grade.

The idea of a project with no boundaries or limitations is a students dream. During the school year it's all about what the teachers want, as a high-school student I don't feel the freedom of creating my own work. I feel as if i'm working to please my teachers so I can get good grades. When i'm doing my work in school it feels like i'm a prisoner sentenced to do write about something I don't care about, I look forward to summertime knowing i'll have my freedom and knowing I won't have to worry about pleasing my teachers. The idea of a student-designed summer project is ideal because there's a whole bunch of things to write about, i'm allowed to work on something that makes me happy or something that i'm actually interested in.

Why would a student-designed project benefit the students? It allows us to learn more about other things, not just what the teacher assigned. We could continue to learn, but we could also teach in a way. By letting students design their own projects we could spread and give knowledge to people that had no idea of the topic because that's not what the teacher assigned. It also helps the teachers learn more about us, what interests us, and why it interests us. Student and teacher relationships are very important, it's much easier to learn from somebody if you trust them and have a special bond with them. Not only do we keep our brains active and learning, it helps the teachers learn more about the students and how they really feel about certain things.

I understand that a student-designed project could benefit in some people not learning, when a teacher designs it they know what's best and they know what will help the student continue to learn. Teacher-designed projects honestly can't be that bad but here is my argument for that. We spend nine months in school learning on a strict plan, waiting for summer to approach, waiting for the freedom of living with no teachers breathing down our backs. I say this because most of my friends feel the same way I do. I have been told many times that my friends are working so hard on their work and want to get that good grade, but they will turn it in and end up getting a bad grade because the teacher felt it wasn't enough for the prompt that they gave them.

We have those important three months of freedom to do as we choose, teachers should understand that and give us the oppurtunities of working passionately with no boundaries.

As I conclude this essay I stand by original statement, I believe that if the project was student-designed, there would be a lot more creativity and will to want to finish the project. If the teacher decides that they will give the students a prompt, it could result in students losing interest in the project and not ending up finishing it. The students are the future of the world and it's important for them to know that they can have moments to learn about things they want, and work on things they want to work on. Summer projects would benefit the students more if it was something they chose to work on.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
2EEC70448423,"Students are often required to complete projects during their summer vacation to ensure they are continuing to learn and practice a subject. Teachers, those who assign and grade the projects, are the experts when it comes to their course. Students need to learn to think outside the box, and having the pressure to come up with their own assignment can be stress-inducing. While some may think students would be allowed more creative room if they made their own summer assignments, I believe teachers should design their students summer projects.

Teachers go to college to earn their education in a specific field in which they would like to teach. Therefore, they spend years upon years learning how to teach that subject of choice. They become experts. In no way is this to discredit the students, as for many, they eventually become very knowledgable in said subject. However, when asked who knows more about a class, it is without a doubt, the teacher. Therefore, why would a student be asked to create a summer assignment when the teacher is the expert in the course? The teacher knows the subject material, so they would also know what would be the most beneficial towards improving a student's knowledge on the course. The students are creative; however, they aren't masters, so they shouldn't be pressured to create their own project.

While some may argue this negates the students ability to express creativity, I believe this forces them to be more open minded. I was once assigned a project in my art class that required using colored pencils to create an abstract piece. I had no experience with the medium or style or artwork; I would have never chosen either. However, this project subsequently became my favorite pieces I've ever made. If one is presented with an assignment they find challenging and undisierable, they are then forced to use creativity to work with it. Rather than recieving the option to make a project they know will be good at and find easier, they are given something they have to work with. This, alone, allows them to make controlled choices about how they choice to complete an assignment.

The ability to choose allows freedom; however, in some cases, choice arrouses anxiety. When a student is posed with the freedom to create whatever assignment they would like over the summer, they may have no idea what to do. If every student has the ability to design different projects ,all completely different, they won't be able to work together or ask questions. While school is out, they most likely won't be able to ask their teachers for help one their summer projects. The stress is taken off their shoulders if they know their isn't another option, esspecially if they don't actually want to make their own assignment.

Summer projects are beneficial towards the developement of ones knowledge in a particular subject. In order for students to learn how to think critically and reduce stress, I believe teachers should design those summer assignments. Afterall, they are considered experts in their field. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
7CBE5AD11805,"Though some schools don't require giving out projects to complete over the summer, others do to make sure students are learning throughout their summer. Assuring that they move forward with their learning process during the summer, students should be able to do their own project based on how they would want it to be designed. Because students are designing their own project, they will be able to showcase all the knowledge they have gained throughout the school year.

Furthermore, with students being able to design their own project, they will express to the teacher everything they have been taught. Showing the teacher your perspective on the information you have processed won't be repetitive or something he/she has seen before, it would be a clean slate and something original to be looking forward too. Every student may have something different or similar. For example creating a poster, PowerPoint or summary of what you've learned. Taking all the information learned may be a difficult task but if you do it in your own way it might not be as hard. Being a student myself I would love to do a self designed project because it would show my own creativity and thoughts put behind the project.

Some may argue that teachers shouldn't be able to design their projects to students because it wouldn't allow students to be open minded about their project, instead it would most likely have to be something narrow or specific in which every student will have nearly the exact same project. For example teachers usually end up assigning the same exact projects to every student, not letting them branch off in their own way. However, this argument presumes that all teachers don't let their students be creative in their own way by assigning similar assignments or projects. As teachers have control on what they assign to students, they should put in a little more thought into what they want their students to do. We as students are capable in doing the projects our teacher assigns us do it but it wouldn't be too much fun or diverse if everyone had nearly the same information and knowledge on every project given.

This is education that students will eventually bring to society and the economy. Will we students let the teacher become the shepherd and us become the sheep, or will we lead our own future and become the shepherd. Therefore, letting students use their creativity and knowledge to create or lead their own project would be more helpful because it would showcase something authentic to the teacher. Instead of having the teacher assign the same project that every student will have, which would limit the students capability to expand on the given project. In conclusion, having the student design their own project would be the better option than having your teacher assign to you. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
75DD7D356424,"Have you ever been assigned a summer project by your teacher? Imagine if you, the student, could design the project. A student-designed project would allow students to base the project off of their personal traits or hobbies, unlike a teacher-designed project. Some argue that summer projects should be student-designed, but others believe it should be teacher-designed. A student-designed project is better than a teacher-designed project because it allows students to incorporate their personal values and it gives students the opportunity to make new friendships.

Students are able to incorporate their personal values in a student-designed project, unlike in a teacher-designed project. Incorporating personal values makes the project more intriguing and fun for students, and it will prevent students from going through the motions while completing the project. For example, in

The Crucible by Arthur Miller, John Proctor is accused of witchcraft. He is found guilty after his trial and is forced to sign a document that states he used witchcraft to bestow evil on the town of Generic_City. John refuses to sign the document believing that it will cast a bad look on his name. This shows the importance of personal values and how they impacted John's decision. A student-designed project allows for students to create a project based on their personal values, which will make the project more meaningful and important to the student.

A student-designed project is better than a teacher-designed project because it allows students to connect with one another through collaborating on an idea for the project. A teacher-designed project does not allow for such collaboration. For example, in

Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, Clarisse McClellan and Guy Montag create a unique friendship by sharing their ideas about the society that they are living in. At first Guy is very timid around Clarisse, but by sharing their ideas of the world around them they become very close. This shows how collaborating on a shared idea can create a friendship. In a student-designed project this is achievable because students will be interacting with each other to design a project.

Many people believe that a teacher-designed project is better than a student-designed project because students could take advantage of a student-designed project, but that just isn't the case. A student-designed project allows for students to incorporate their personal values and gives them the opportunity to create new friendships. Summer projects should be student-designed, don't allow teacher-designed projects to take away a great opportunity for students to learn something new about themselves or their peers. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

Some schools will make it a choice between the projects being teacher-designed or student-designed, and many staff and students would want the projects to be student-designed. The project being student-designed gives students motivation, gives students creativity, and gives students a way of showing his or her knowledge.

Even though staff, teachers, and maybe parents would want the project to be teacher-designed because he or she would not have that much faith in a student. But since it will be a teacher designing the projects students would know what to do and will be able to complete the assignment. Teachers will design the project assignments a little challenging to know where the student is at. What critics failed to consider is that in the eyes of a student, if he or she is being assigned projects over summer break he or she would not want to do it, and then the results of that would be not having the assignments completed. Students will see the project assignments as homework and will not have any motivation to do it.

Having the projects students-designed students will be more motivated to finish the project assignments. Students will be excited to do his or her project. Students will be excited because it is letting him or her have freedom to show the teachers what he or she can do. Students will want to work hard to accomplish the project that was designed by themselves, the student. Students would work hard to see the results of the project. Having the projects student designed will have the students thinking on what one will do for the project so it will help him or her be motivated. Also having the projects student-designed it creates creativity for the students.

With the projects being student-designed it helps students get creative with the projects. Students will have to come up with new ideas on their own to start the project. This also creates freedom of choice for the students. Students will need also explore new ideas, sources, and information. The projects will be student-designed which allows his or her project to be unique so then it will be nice to see the ending results to the project. Then comes the knowledge part.

With the projects being student-designed this allows the teachers to see what the student knows now. Students will show if he or she still knows things from school. Teachers will be able to see what the student is struggling in. Teachers will see what that student is good at and if the students is gaining any new knowledge. This helps teachers to improve their teaching skills or if the teacher needs to slow down and teacher at a slower pace for some students. Teachers will see if the students can use any old knowledge that they have which shows that the student can keep and hold in information that was taught to the students from years ago. Students will also see what they would need to improve, if he or she needs to study more or pay more close attention. Students may even need to ask for help from the teachers. Having the summer project assignments student-designed creates a lot of ideas and new ways to help both the teacher and student succeed in learning.

Some schools have summer projects and there is a choice of the project being teacher-designed or student-designed. A student-deigned project allows students to be more active in the project, allows students to gain creativity, and it allows students to show teachers what he or she know and what he or she does not know.

77B1A113941A,"Some schools think it is a good idea to require students to complete a project over the summer. Many people would probably agree with this to assure that all students continue to learn over the break. The main question is weather the students should design the project or the schools and teachers should. There would be pros and cons to both decisions but what would be best for the students. Most students would likely would dread this project because it is something that is required to be completed over the summer when they should be getting a break. I think that if you wanted to ensure each student completes it then they should be the ones that design it, so it is in their best interest and it will be something that they want to do well on.

Summer break is something that is needed for students to get a relaxing break from all the stress of school; one thing that would make it less so is having them complete a summer project. A summer project is obviously something students don't want to be worrying about during a break. If teachers designed the projects students will have much less interest and it will be looked at it as something that needs to be completed as a school project. If you have the student design the project it will be looked at in a totally different way. The project would now be something that they would want to complete for themselves. They would work harder on it and be proud of the work they have done.

Another reason making the projects student designed is the best option is because some students coming from low class families don't have the materials at home to complete it or even possibly the money to buy them. When designing the project the student should and will keep this in mind so that they can ensure they have the right materials at home and if not they will make sure there is a way they can obtain them. Another problem they could run into is that there might not be adequate internet at home or even none at all. Research is a primary resource when trying to complete a project and without internet connection that is a very difficult task. Students with this issue would ensure that no research is needed or that they already know lots about the topic of their project.

One main reason that summer projects should be student designed is the students could pick a topic that they have a passion about or a hobby they enjoy. If the teacher designs the project then it could be on a topic or about something they student doesn't enjoy or has no interest in. With a summer project the students designed themselves would have a drive to complete it over the summer, and not only would they complete it they would do their best work. Having a project that students designed they would want to see it completed and see it done the best way possible.

With everything meticulously thought about and taken into account student designed is for sure they right decision if teachers want properly completed projects. With the students designing the projects there are many benefits from students actually completing it to being able to afford the materials. With student designed projects it will ensure that they complete them and enjoy the process of completing them, and once they are done they will be proud of what the have completed.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

This idea will constantly keep the students involved and learning. The summer projects should be teacher-designed because it prepares the students for the upcoming year, it prepares the students for the workforce, and it gives constant interactions with the material for the upcoming year.

First, the reason why the summer projects should be teacher-designed is because the students would be ready for the upcoming year. If the teachers design the projects the students will be used to him/her giving them instructions. For example, if Generic_Name was not assigned his own project, and he picked his own it might pick a easy project which he would not put all his effort into. However, if Generic_Name was assigned a project by his teacher he would not have any other choice, so he would be more efficient with his time and work. One can easily see that if the teachers pick the summer projects it would be more effective.

Second, another reason why the summer projects should be assigned by teachers is because it would prepare the students for the workforce. If students had the choice of what summer project to do it would not prepare them for the workforce. For example, if Generic_Name has a job at the local Burger King, and his boss says ""clean the grill""

he has to do it or he will lose his job. If the summer projects are teacher-assigned Generic_Name would be used to being assigned a responsibility. It is obvious that the summer projects should be a teachers decision instead of allowing the students to decide their own summer project.

Lastly, the last reason why teachers should assign the summer projects is because it will give the student constant interactions with the material for the upcoming school year. If the students have the choice on their own summer projects it would not help them with the upcoming semester. With the teacher-assigned summer projects the students would know what to prepare for in the upcoming year, and have an idea of what they're learning. For example, if Generic_Name choose her own project should would not have any idea what she would be learning that upcoming semester. However, if her teachers assigned her project she would have an idea of what she would be learning. One can easily see that allowing the teachers to assign the students projects that it would be more beneficial.

Others would argue that the students should chose their own projects because they could pick something they enjoy,it builds responsibility, and it teaches the students how to make their own decisions. However, the teacher-assigned summer projects are more effective. The students summer projects should be assigned by the teachers because it prepares them for the upcoming year, prepares them for the workforce, and it has the students in constant interactions with the material for the upcoming semester. If students pick their own summer projects they will struggle during their next school year, so call your local school board, and sign the petition for the teacher-assigned summer projects. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
EAEC2EA52BEC,"Whether we are a students or not we are constantly learning new things, its a part of life. Thats how we mentally grow and experience new things. Summer is the one time of the year where we get a long period of holidays, everyone plans out their summer differently. Some have trips plans out while others have no idea how they're going to spend their free time. Majority of students don't like having any sort of school work during summer but to my knowledge a lot of schools and colleges give their students some sort of summer work to do, whether thats paper work or going out and doing field work. I agree with schools giving their students teacher-designed summer projects. The reasoning being that our teachers know best what knowledge we need to retain or dive deeper into. And they also know their students capabilities, they won't assign something they know isn't realistic or hard to accomplish. Teachers always try to make their learning material interesting so their students are more invested into the topic, which is why it's more reasonable to have teacher-designed summer projects.

Whether we think we know everything or not, we are still students who are learning and growing from our mistakes. At times we might think we know whats best for us, and that might be true in some cases, but a lot of the time taking someone's advice who is older then us and is much more experienced, helps. Students might argue with their teachers that what they've learned and studied all year will stay in their memory and that they don't need summer projects on them. But the benefit of having teacher-designed projects is that it helps us not forget what we've learned all year, they are designed in a way that help us retain our knowledge. This way the effort our teachers put in to teach us new things does't go to waste. One summer my biology teacher had given me a summer project of making a 3D display of the heart. At first I didn't want to do it but my teacher advised me that it'll help me retain the knowledge I knew about the heart, which indeed it did. In the beginning everything I knew about the heart wasn't as perfectly stored in my memory but after doing this project not only did I know the parts of the heart but also all of their functions and the purpose of the heart which is to pump blood. Not only was I able to learn and memorize my material perfectly but I also learned new things. If my teacher had let us pick and design our own summer projects, knowing myself I would have picked something that would have been far too easy and on a topic that I knew I was perfect at. That wouldn't have helped me at all ,although it would have been easy work I wouldn't have learned anything and I would have wasted my time. Being a student means that you should always be learning something, teacher-designed summer projects are might for this reason.

When teachers design our summer projects, they keep in mind the capabilities their students have and whether the project they're designing is realistic for their students to accomplish with out struggling. Teachers are always trying to help their students out in any way possible, they would never assign something in which students are bound to fail in. At times when students are given the choice to choose their project, a majority vote is taken just so the whole class is working on the same topic. A lot of the times, what I've experience is that students agree to things just because their classmates want to do it, in the fear that their friends and classmates will go against them. This way some students don't feel comfortable doing the project because they know it'll be hard for them. When teachers design our projects they keep in mind how every student will attempt the project and this way all the students are able to complete the project without having a hard time. When ever my teacher left it up to me to pick a project I would have a hard time choosing one because I wouldn't know how it'll turn our or will I have a hard time completing it half way through. When my English teacher told us we were going to have a summer project of reading a novel and writing a essay on it, I was excited but I was also worried that the novel our class might choose, I wouldn't like or have hard time understanding. My teacher made it easier for us when she picking the novel her self. She knew what kind of book her class would be interested in and would be able to complete the assignment.

Some might say that teacher-designed projects would be boring and thats some thing they don't want to do in summer as they want to enjoy their time off from school. But teachers understand that and know that the only way their students will complete their project is that if it wasn't boring. Even during the school year teachers try to make their lessons as interesting as possible to keep their kids involved. Summer projects don't have to be paper work, it can also be something that has to be physically done. So, that means that you'll have fun, new experiences, they might also be required to be done with a friend which makes the project a whole lot better. So I still agree with teacher-designed projects as they not only help us but keep us on the right path of what we should be doing and learning while having fun.

In conclusion, I consider having teacher-designed summer projects much more beneficial for us. It not only saves us from the trouble of choosing and deciding on a project but also gives the opportunity for our teacher to help us out with anything we're struggling with and need more practice on. This responsibility should be left on the teacher and not the student. Summer might be a time to enjoy and relax but that shouldn't mean that we should totally let ourselves go and be unproductive. Having summer projects at times gives us new experiences and they help us out when we come back to school, not having forgotten everything.               ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
A74B8AFE4174,"It is finally summer! Students have been released from school and are ready for the joys of this hot, laid back season. However, they must also work on their summer project, which can tend to be slightly irritating, but not if students design their own summer project. Summer projects should be designed by students because it lets the projects be tailored to the students' summers and lets them have some freedom during their vacation.

Firstly, summer projects should be student-designed because they can design them to be tailored to their vacation. For example, if some students are going to travel abroad during vacation, they can design the project to include elements of what they learned while outside of the country, whereas students who stay closer to home can apply their daily life to their project. As a result, students can be assured that they will have something they can use in their project since it's designed to accommodate the variables of students' experiences, which aids to making summer feel laid back.

In addition, student-designed summer projects can let students have some freedom during their vacation. For example, a speech class can choose to write a speech on their summer and what life lessons they learned during it. By doing do, the students can proceed on enjoying their summer and can then spend the final stretch of summer writing their speech. Summer is supposed to be a time away from the stresses of school, so if students can enjoy their summer by having the project designed to be completed at the end of vacation, they can feel more satisfied and theyll be more prepared to get used to completing work once they return to school.

In summary, students can have a far more enjoyable summer project if they design it. They are more beneficial compared to teacher-designed summer projects because students can adjust the project to their situations by making certain criteria open ended and have more freedoms by making the project be non-interfering to their vacation. In the end, students will have a much more satisfactory summer project, which will raise their spirits for future tasks",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
9610F24FDFA7,"Imagine worrying for 9+ months about completing assignments just to worry some more during the only lengthy break students get. There is too much that students have to worry about during the school year, they have to worry about quizzes, exams, homework, projects, SATs, etc.. I think that is more than enough for students to handle and they do not need the add on stress of teacher-designed summer projects. Teachers always tend to give students projects that are too hard for them to complete and most of the time they are not necessary for their education. For instance, for my psychology class I had to survey students about their summer projects so I asked them what is one thing they would change about how teachers make them. Most of them said they would stress a lot less if they were able to pick their own project and make it short but also beneficial. They wanted it to be on things they struggle on and need to refresh before going back to a new school year. Some may believe otherwise, but summer projects should be student-designed because students need a break from stressing and teachers do not know the students' mental capacity better than the students themselves.

Once school is out, all students want to do is relax and take a break from stressing out but they cannot do that when teachers assign long and stressful projects that take a lot of research and hard work to complete. Middle and high school students have enough on their plate to worry about, they need their summer to take a break from stressing out for at least a couple months. When teachers go out of their way to make those projects so hard to comprehend and too long, students will never be able to enjoy their break. If I got to design my own, I would make a project that does not stress me out to the point that I cannot enjoy my summer with my family and friends. To be specific, I never got to design my own summer project before but if anyone would ask me if I ever benefited from doing the teacher-designed ones I would say 100% not. Doing my own designed projects would put my mind at ease because in my head I know that I have the freedom to pick what I want and do it in a way that will help me in that class. Therefore, all that stress that I would get from the teacher designed projects would decrease a whole lot if I got to do it on my own.

Teachers might think they know what is best for students' education however that is not entirely true. At this point in a students' education they should know what is the best way for them to learn, what challenges them and what they would need a refresher on during the summer. In my opinion, students are more than capable to design their own projects based on areas of weaknesses and strengths. To go more in depth, most of the time I think teachers give busy work for summer projects. I do not think it really benefits students in that specific class when they start school. For example, my cousin goes to school in a different county but every summer her and I do our summer projects together. Last summer, we both took chemistry but our summer assignments were completely different. My project was to memorize some of the periodic table and do research on one of the elements. I found that to be completely useless because I know the periodic table really well so it did not really expand my cognitive skills. On the other hand, hers was to to pick a unit from a list the teacher provided and make a chart with facts and write mnemonics about it. I found that to be a really helpful way for her to remember that unit. She also made sure to pick a topic that she knew she struggles in. Another example that shows my point is teachers who give out those summer projects do not really know the students yet, so how would they have a clue what on areas they need help on. When they design the project they do it for students in general but not specifically for one student's needs. That is exactly why It is smarter for students to make their own summer projects to fit their capabilities and areas of weaknesses.

Other people might think teacher designed projects are better for students because they think students will make the project as easy as they can so they can get it over with. That reason is understandable however, it is flawed due to the fact that teachers would have to check the projects before students start. At the end of the day there is really no use for students to make an easy project because they would not benefit from it and most of them know that summer projects help them get a head start on things they need the most help on, without it they could really struggle in that class. For example, my english teacher from last year showed us a percentage of students who did the summer project and students who did not and then showed the difference of their pre test scores. It is obvious that students who did their project excelled at the pre test unlike the ones who did not because the project was too hard for them. So, to go back to my point if students were to design their own projects in the first place they would have had the motivation to complete it and score well based on the work they put in the project.

To summarize the totality of the argument, I think teachers should really reconsider letting students design their own summer projects for the benefit of their education and their stress levels. Teachers should want their students to succeed in their class and start off stress free. Summer projects are a way for students to start off the school year at the top of their game, refreshed and ready to work hard and succeed.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0

Student-designed summer projects

Most students and teachers look forward to summer. No more grading papers,taking quizzes, or turning in homework. Although it may be summer some schools still require that students complete a summer project to assure they are still learning. All summer projects should be student-designed because they'll be able to more creative as well as they'll understand the assignment better.

Often students get confused when assigned projects over the summer one of the main reasons are because they don't understand the topic. By allowing the students to design there own assignments will help them make their project more detailed. For example, a student could take a family vacation out of town once they've arrived back home they could design a detailed poster board of all the historical sites they saw while on vacation. Also, In the summer most kids volunteer and do other stuff around the community a student could type an essay as their summer project about the importance of giving back. During the summer the teacher most likely won't be available to answer any questions, comments, or concerns. If the project is student-designed then there will be no need for the students to reach out to there teachers because they'll have all the information they need because they're creating they're own topic for the project.

Although, some teachers or even students may feel that the summer projects should be teacher-designed because it allows the teacher to know exactly what they're grading ,others feels it limits creativity for the students. When assigned a project there is usually a rubric the teachers hand out. Students feel as if this limits them to there creative abilities because they have to follow a rubric that tells them exactly how everything has to be done. Students want to have control over there summer projects so when they return to school they will be more confident presenting the projects. Teachers will be able to grade the students based off of their creativity and see that the student took there time and worked hard over the summer on the assignment .When students design their own work without any guidelines they're allowed to be more creative as well as more detailed in their work.

In conclusion, students should be allowed to design their own summer projects because theyll understand it better as well as show there creativity in their work.                  ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
F377008A387D,"PROMPT : SOME SCHOOLS REQUIRE STUDENTS TO COMPLETE SUMMER PROJECTS TO ASSURE THEY CONTINUE LEARNING DURING THIER BREAK. SHOULD THESE SUMMER PROJECTS BE TEACHER-DESIGNED OR STUDENT-DESIGNED? TAKE A POSITION ON THIS QUESTION. SUPPORT YOUR RESPONSE WITH REASONS AND SPECIFIC EXAMPLES.

Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? While some say that they would like student-designed projects, other may want teacher-designed projects. There's some reasons why students chose either one.

Although some say they want student-designed projects, some want teacher-designed projects. The main reason why students may want teacher-designed projects is because they not have any inspiration on what their project should be designed as, if they did it themselves, (without any requirements or checklists). While having a teacher-designed projects, teachers may list requirements and all for the project to make sure students are going on the right track to getting a good grade for the project. Having followed the teachers requirement list for the project, students may live up to exactly what teachers expect for the project.

While some had said that they enjoy teacher-designed projects, some say that they actually enjoy student-designed projects. The main reason why students may want student-designed projects is, during summer break, students may travel or do many other things, and they could do their project(s) based on their activities. Students may show lots of their creativity skill, which could help them get a good grade on the project. While having to create their own project from scratch,students may develop many ideas for their project(s).

Some say that neither teacher nor student-designed projects could be assured that students would continue learning during summer break. Students would want to not do any type of school-related work, except relax during summer break. Students might not finish their projects because they weren't in town, or they didn't have time to buy supplies..etc. Another reason why students might be able to finish their projects on time is that they might have jobs and work all day, everyday in the summertime, so it could be a little hard for them to finish on time.

In conclusion, summer projects should be teacher or student-designed based on the students decision, because it could be challenging for students... ",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
B82D39FFC692,"As a student, who doesnt enjoy summer? It's a time for them to reflect on themselves after a long school year and put their mind at ease after finally having the break they have been waiting for. After schools releases their students off to their summer vacation, they strongly encourage them to still continue learning during their time off from school. With that they assign different summer projects to still have them excersize their brain and knowledge; for instance a summer assignment that is most fimmiliar to students would be the summer reading project, to which they choose and read which ever book interests them most and then go back to school and share it to their teacher as well as what they have learned from it. These assignments are important for students to participate in to keep them in the same academic mindset and prepare them for the next coming school year, but the real question is should these projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? With these two option comes with different learning experiences. Although summer time projects would be helpful being designed by a teacher, it would be more beneficial for the student if it was designed by themselves to excersize their ability of creativity, allow them to work at their own pace and time, and lead them to form a stronger connection with their teachers.

Creativity is a critical tool for schools to encourage onto their students so that they could be able use it even beyond their days of schooling. If teachers give projects out to students that allows it to be designed by themselves these students will be able to test their ability to use their own ideas. Usually teachers goals are to help students build their knowledge, and see how much they are capable of. Although with that how would these students be able to seek that knowledge and creativity if they are permitted to go through guidlines and specific instructions? This would make that proccess harder for them. Having to follow the teachers choice of intructions students wont be able to see or know how far their abilites could go. This idea used in summer projects would really benefit these students because especially during their break their mindset changes a lot. Just by being out of the school environment students behaviors and thoughts change drastically. If they are able to design their own projects and truly invest their time into it they can put together something amazing through their creativity that could introduce the side of them schools dont see often. This new technique is truly the way to keep students knowledge flowing throughout their break time.

Stress is something that most students go through a lot throughout the school year which could really hurt them in terms of their mental state. Many statistics show that stress is increasing and getring worst for students as years go by. This happens often because some teachers sometimes lack to put into consideration how much work students usually have outside of their classes wether it would be school sports, clubs, or even just an excessive amount of homework. Althought some could argue that teachers designing their students assignment could give students the appropiate guidlines to help use their knowledge throughout their summer breaks, but the only person that knows a students comfortable limit of work around their daily routine is the student themselves, during the summer many of them could be out of town for majority of their break and to which they wont be able to have enough time to balance their own routine and the schools summer assignment. If students are able to design their own work they would be able to put together what goes for them best.

Not only could this oppurtuinty help benefit students but it could as well help teachers. This could allow them to build a connection with their students by seeing what they have created. There are some cases where during the school years a teacher and student connection might not be as strong and go no more then work and grading. Its important for schools to really build students and teachers connection more because it helps make the students much more comfortable in their school environment which could allow them to be themselves more. With this being incorporating it helps build that connection by having the the teacher see how the students thinks by their creativity and what they chose to put together during their break. Teachers could as well use this creative technique to challenge students during the school year by putting their projects into competitions instructing that the student with the most impressive work wins some sort of prize. This not only gives teachers the idea of fun ways to grade their students but it as well motivates the students to work harder and put more time into this summer assignment.

In conclusion these student-designed summer projects has many different beneficial oppurtunities for both students and teachers. With all this being said summer time projects would be helpful being designed by a teacher, but having students be able to design in themselves would be much more helpful for them to use their creativity, work with their own time, and build a better connection with their teachers. This could help change ways most students view school, and the creativity used could impact a more positive response towards the student and help them see how much they are capable of in showing their ideas. Not only could this student-designed method be useful in just summer projects but it could as well be useful in assignments during school. Teachers should be able to excersize this method more to their students to give a different aspect to learning and education.    ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
7D8CAB0224DA,"Summer is the time student get a break from school and the stress that comes with it. It is a time they get to have fun with the friends and family. Where they get to explore the world and having them do a project during this time is awful. But if it is required, the best suggestion would be to let the student decide what their project would be about. If they have to take time from their vacation to work on something, it should be something they have control over and something they have an insterest in. Not only will they have fun doing the project, they will learn something new.

There are many reasons as to why allowing students pick their project would be the best. For example, students are more likely to put time and effort into what they are learning if they are exicted for. They will learn better and understand what they are doing if they are exicted about what they are learning. If the student have control over what they have to do, it will most likely involve what they are planing to do that summer. Also no one wants feel like they are working during vacation, it takes the fun out of the break. Students who enjoy what they are learning are more likely to pay attention in class and that goes for the summer project. If they willing to use the limited time they have to enjoy the summer, it would definitly be something they want to learn about or something they have an insterest in.

This could also open other doors for the students. The more they have control over the topic, the more they learn something new not just about the topic but even about themselves. The more time they spend figuing out what they will be working on this summer, the more knowledge they gain. For instance, in order for them to find the perfect project they would need to try different topics to see what fits them. This gives the a chance to expore and to see what other topics that may interest them; that option is taking away when the teachers are the one making the choice for the students. The main idea or reason for giving the students a summer project is to make sure that, they students are learning over the summer. But it is not really possible when the students do not have right to choose the project, not only are they not really going to their best, some just won't do it.

There will be a bigger range of topics when the students have the choice. This does not only impact the students but the teachers that have to grade the student's project. Not only will they not have to waste time having to grade project that are done will little to no effort. The teachers can get exicted to grade students who put effort and time into what they did because they not only had fun but actually enjoyed what they had to do. There are many issues that can come with this desicion, regardless of its benefits. One main problem would be the students will not take it serouisly as they should because they will have control over how the project is done. Instead of having a rubric made by the teacher as to how it is done, they will have the freedom do as they please. Which could have a postive or negative impact, giving students this amount of freedom can be used in the wrong way.

However, giving the students the ability to make their own choices goes beyond school, this is something that will impact their life. Allowing the students to think of themselves will benefit them when they are in this big world on their own. Which is why students are forced to go to school in the first place, to prepare them for life. Students in general do not get the chance to decide how their days are spent. The way they spend their day is decided by someone else wheather their parents or by the school. They are told when to wake up every morning, where they are suppose to be at every hour, what they have to learn, even when and what they have to eat. So giving the student a chance to decide for themsleves on what they have to do during the summer, goes beyond learning something new during summer break but how to be their own person.      ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
5273831FA984,"Summer projects designed by teachers can boost students' minds over break. It can help assure that their minds still continue to learn while away from school. Teachers should decide the projects for students over summer break for three reason. Teachers have wider knowledge than students. They know what students need to learn over summer in order to produce better results as students go through each grade level. Teachers have increased experience than students. Designing projects by teachers will have a greater effect on students during summer than students designing the projects.

Teachers have already been through school and have deeper knowledge on how projects should be designed. They know how to make the ideal project for students to learn more. This will add on to what students know and help prepare them for the next year. If students created the projects, there would be no opportunity for achieving greater knowledge. Students would only apply what they have learned during the previous school year to project. Teachers are able to provide their academics from the times when they were in school. Having this knowledge from earlier school years can have an inclined effect on what the students learn over the break.

Teachers know what to expect for the students' next school year. They know how to design the projects to help prepare students. Student would not have the same knowledge as a teacher, which in return, will lower the chances of some students having straight A's. Teachers can help grow students' minds because they know what those students will learn in the coming years. Students would also try to make the projects easy on themselves if they had the ability to create the projects. They would make the work too simple. No student wants work over break, or willing to challenge themselves.

Being older and experienced can help students learn more. Teachers are continuously creating projects and assignments. Students do not have this ability. Projects would seem like an amateur made them if they were designed by students. Teachers know what the students need in order to expand their minds. However, the one thing students know how to do is make the projects fun. On the other hand, learning in a fun way can hinder how much the student learns. Teacher-designed projects are better for students' academics.

Students should not be allowed to design the projects assigned to them over summer. Teachers can provide a more inclined chance of being successful in school. Having more knowledge creates better projects. Teachers know what students need for next year. Being young can cause problems when creating projects. There is a better outcome from projects being designed by teachers. More academic success comes from those projects.  ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
23040674ECD6,"Some schools require summer projects make sure that students are continue learning in their summer break. The concept of summer projects should engage the students to think critically even without a classroom setting. This would benefit the students as they will remember how to study and work ethically even with the long summer break. However, summer projects should be student-designed because student-designed projects would allow them to further invest their interests and will not bore the students during summer vacation/break.

Student-designed projects would allow the students to further invest in their interests. Allowing students to choose their topic will increase the productivity and enjoy the project. While this is not a summer project, Generic_School has a school wide project called an EOL that is similar to the concept being presented. The EOL or Exhibition of Learning is a day where students present their interests to the other students and school staff. This ranges from extracurricular activities to hobbies, and even more. Almost every single student that participated enjoyed presenting and sharing their true passion to everyone in the school. The similar concept used in Generic_School can be used during the summer in different schools to engage the students more and them to have fun and not considered it a chore. Another example are summer reading choice books. If the school or class assigned a specific book, usually the students will procrastinate until the last week. But given the choice to choose their books could spark the interest needed. Having the option to choose is very important to engage a student. However, some could argue that the project is not appropriate or seems too easy. This can be prevent with some types of requirements, basic outline, and the approval from the student's teacher. Summer projects should not be a boring task that is done near the end of the break because it just due at the start of the school.

Teacher-designed projects would bore and stress the students during the time of relaxation. Given the time of summer break, which is approximately 3 months in the standard US education system, the expectation of the project would stress out the students. The point of a summer vacation is to relax, have fun, and get ready for next year. Given the span of the time, forcing students to do something that does not interest them would cause them to continue push it till the last day. This promotes procrastination which is very unhealthy for a student as it caused a stress overload on the due date. Teaching and maintain how to do work in a reasonable time line should also be the goal. Stressing the students in the summer is not a smart idea because they are ""burnt out"" from the school year and need time to ""heal"". In real life, there is an argument that working does not give them the option to choose and are assigned to them. This is easily proven otherwise due to the fact that teacher-designed could cause them, in the future, to do the same thing they did in school, stress over it. Learning to stress and procrastinate in school can be lead onto the student's future. Allowing them to choose would stop procrastination and high stress levels and engage them to finish the project in a reasonable time setting. Also, forcing students to conduct a project on a topic they dislike is very harsh to do in the summer. As soon as they complete the rough end of the year tests, they are forced into a task with little to no interest. As anyone that went to school, being forced into something that does not interest them is very boring and they stress over it. An example of this can be found in real life as youtubers, content creators online, stress and have mental issues because the fans are requesting a video that the youtuber is not interested in. Summer vacation is thought of for teens and kids to have fun and explore not be locked in a library/room to conduct a project. Teacher designed projects are not a smart idea to engage the student during break.

Summer projects are a great idea to keep the students still engaged in school related topics. The way summer projects are forced onto the students are the problem.

Plus I feel like the teachers can think of ideas for the prodject better then we can because they know what they want from us and we don't. See the rough part about all of this is the fact that over half of the kids myself included will just put it off until the end of the break or just won't do it all. So therefor if the student's don't do it not only is it going to hurt their grades but it also isn't fair for them because it almost seems like they are forced to do a prodject during there time off from school.

Now this could be a great time as a teacher to see how responsible their student's are becoming. One of the ways you can tell is by seeing if they even started or finished because if they at least started the prodject at least you know that they thought about it or was planning on finnishing it and over time just forgot about it and if you was to finish it it will show the teacher that you're resonsible enough to do that at least. Another way to tell is to see if they remember befor they go on break like you should tell them at least once before class starts and once after class that way it sticks in their head and they don't foget about it before break starts. Not only will this prepare them for the future but it will also teach them how important responsibility is. Responsibility is a huge thing this word means more to some then to others and that's beacause most people look at how responsible you are on your own before they can let you branch out to others. It's honestly just one of those things if you show good responsibility life will become easier as time flies past.

Also another reason allowing students to think of their own prodjects would be a good idea is because it allows you to see exactly how creative they can be if they used their own thoughts and imagination. Because yeah teachers can think of something quick and easy for you to do for the prodject but that doesn't show how creative that student really can be. You never know what type of fun things they can put together for the prodject they could always think of something the teacher would have never thought about and really blow them out of the park with how good they did. This just shows them how responsible you are or can be when you're willing to do the work. Yes I know most kids don't want to be working on a prodject during the summer but if they was to just work and get the prodject over with that will give them the rest of the summer and they won't have to worry about finifhing up that prodject durign their break.

Now back to what I believe schools should do. And that is I believe schools should have the teachers come up with the prodject ideas. The main reason for that is because I am one of those kids that will put something such as a prodject to the edge and just forget about it until school is about to start back up and then I'll remember and try my best to get it done before the first day of school. Yes I know I shouldn't do that and I should just do it to get it over with but that's just not how I work. I am the type like most others who don't want to do anything while im on break especially if we are on summer break because that's the time in my head that I have to myself. So that's why I think the teachers should be responsible for coming up with the ideas not only because we might end up forgetting about it until the last minute but also because we can't just think of something for a prodject right away but the teachers can because they know exactly what they want to hear or see from us. So why not let them think of the Ideas and we just create what we think would be a resonable response.

Now to conclude all this off I just think it would be easier for us as students if our teachers was to hand us a prompt or prodject ideas befor we head out for break rather then us having to go out and find someting to do the prodject on. Plus I feel like it would actually mtivate the students to do the work since they only have to do a bit of research and do the prodject. The way taht I see it is Summer is meant for us to have fun and enjoy ourselves with no school but to add a prodject to do during the break almost feels like our summer is being taken away a bit. Most people such as myself won't do the work or they will but they will wait until it's literaly the last week of break and start working on it and to make it easier on kids like myself I feel like the teachers should think of the ideas and just hand out papers stating exactly what they want and how they want it done.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
E540DE3C35CB,"Most students do not do summer projects due to the fact that students do not find the topics of summer projects interesting. Many teachers usually choose projects students have no interest in, which is the probable cause of why students do not usually do their summer projects. Having summer projects that are based off the students interest can increase the chances of students doing their projects. If students start doing their projects; students would continue learning over break, enjoy the topic assigned, and increase the chances of doing other projects that could be assigned.

Summer projects are meant to have students continue their learning even when on break. A project is still a project, whether it is teacher-designed or student designed. The difference between the teacher-designed and the student-designed is that if it is teacher-designed, students usually do not do them because there is nothing interesting about it, but for student-designed projects there will be a much likelier chance of students doing the project based off the topic they want to choose, they are still learning over break so why not make it something students can also enjoy. Over the years that I have been in school I have found it much easier and enjoyable to do projects I know would be interesting to me. I get to research and write about something I find so fascinating instead of doing a project on something that has never caught my interest.

Enjoying the topic assigned to students can be a very big benefit because, students start showing passion and enthusiasm in their project that they have never shown before in any other projects. Researching in a topic that I would want to know more about can make me feel confident, enthusiastic, and passionate in my project rather than researching about a topic I never knew existed.

Many teachers only give projects that are based off of the subject they teach, but not every student finds that subject interesting, that subject can be their weakest subject and to have projects assigned to continue learning for students over break will not benefit them. Giving out a project that they would enjoy and mixing it with the subject the teacher teaches can help the student without the student realizing. After giving out projects the students would enjoy, the likelihood of the students doing other projects assigned will be high.

In other words, student-designed projects can benefit both students and teachers because students will do the projects assigned. The students will be given a topic that is unique and interesting to them which can cause them to be confident in their project, they will also be learning while working on the project, and give them many ideas for their next project. Let us not forget that on the other hand, teachers may assign projects that are teacher-designed because they know it will benefit students in ways they would not be able to understand yet. It can expand the knowledge of students, open up a new topic they never knew about and could find interesting, and it can help teachers see where their students are struggling. Everything is done with a reason.    ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
E99200305F7B,"Some students think that they should design their assigned summer projects, but they are wrong. If students designed what their summer projects were they would be helpless. There are many downsides to student-designed projects. They would have to provide themselves with supplies; rather, if their teacher designed the project, they may of have had provided supplies. Students would not have any assistance or encouragement from their teachers if they were to design the summer project themselves. Teachers should always design summer projects.

Firstly, students should not design their own summer projects because they would be confused and clueless. They would be confused because they would have to develop their own ideas on what the project should be. The development of projects are a process. Teachers would have to come up with a layout of what the students should do, if they should work independently or with a group, and even if they want the students to do a presentation on the assignment. The process a teacher goes through to make not just projects, but also assignments, is stressful. For example, I once was helping one of my teachers develop a project for her class. There were many steps that had to be completed before the assignment was finalized. The steps included the entire idea of the project, the items that the students had to complete for full credit, and also the grading scale. If students had a choice on designing their summer projects, they would be too stressed out they would not have any time to relax.

Secondly, most teachers provide supplies for their students to complete their projects. If students designed their own summer projects, they would have to provide themselves with the supplies they need. When students have to provide themselves with supplies, it removes money that could have been spent on something else. When teachers supply their students the products they need, it is very helpful for the students. If a student was at their house with no supplies, they would have to go buy some; however, if the teacher designed the project, the supplies would have been free and easy accessible. Teacher-designed projects are helpful to a student in need of supplies.

Lastly, if a student designed their own project they would have no assistance from the teacher on what the project was, what the idea of the project should be, or even how to start the project. Most of the time, students have many questions to ask about summer projects before school ends. Students may not be able to do that if they were to design the project themselves. A student may need help on deciding how to start the project before school ends, and the teacher would be able to answer. If the student designed the project and had no idea what to start the project about, they would be extremely stressed out about a summer project. The teacher should be able to encourage the student if they design the project.

In conclusion, I think teachers should design their own projects to their students. If a student has stress on them about developing a project, they would have no time to enjoy the summer. If a student designed their own project, they would not know how to develop the outline of the project, which is the starting or basic all around sections of the project. Most teachers supply students with products that can be used on their projects; consequently, if a student designed a project for themselves over the summer, they would have to provide themselves with supplies. Also student-designed projects have no teacher assistance. Especially over the summer, students have no contact with their teacher. Students should not design their own summer projects. To all teachers, keep up the good work!        ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
DFCE04EE5E11,"Everyone loves summer break, specially students. They get about 2 and half months to go out do activities that they couldn't do when the school is running. There are many outdoors and indoors activities that students engage in during summer break some of outdoors activities are going to beach, pool, and many other places. Some indoors activities are learning new skills, working on projects, talking extra online classes etc. Engaging in all these activities might lead to students not wanting to learn and go back to school. Which is why some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. I think these summer projects should be teacher-designed because teacher can give students with projects that will help them when they come back to school, students can figure out if they like that class or not, and it will keep students in right track.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teacher can give students projects that will help them when they come back because teacher will teach them that subject in their next school year. When I was going to 9th grade we got to choose if we want to do summer projects or not. Most of us chose not to do the summer projects, instead we did not even look at any study materials during our break. There were few people in my class who did do their projects. The people who did their projects were able to answer all the questions asked by the teacher on topics that weren't taught to us. The students were able to answer the question because they were supposed to look up information and learn about that topic in the project. This shows that teacher-designed projects are better because teacher can make them study topics that they would need next year.

Teacher-designed summer projects are better than student-designed summer projects because students will not struggle in class. This is because summer projects designed by teacher allows students to learn and figure out their weakness in a particular area of that subject which also allows them to figure out if that subject is for them or not. For example, in my AP Computer Science class in 10th grade people didn't do their summer assignment because the teacher said she would not grade it. From the very beginning there were only few people who knew what was going on in class, rest of the students had no clue of what was happening because they were not interested in Computer Science, they would have known weather they are interested or not only if they had done the summer projects. Having summer projects and doing it helps students know what to expect from the class they are taking and weather to drop out before the school start or to continue with the class.

Summer project are good to keep students in track for next school year, and it is better if that summer project is designed by teacher. When students design their own project then they could choose things that are easy. Working on easy projects during summer break will take students off track for next school year. If a student designed a project where they have to sleep and watch TV, they will loose track of their sense and responsibility as a student. It would make them not wanting to go back to school. Once, one student didn't come to school a whole month after summer break because he was in love with his summer holidays and didn't wanted to come back to school. If he had summer project that he worked on during his summer break then he would not go off track.

Some may argue that teacher-designed projects are hard for students, and students should be allowed to whatever they want during their break. They are not completely wrong that teacher-designed projects are hard, but teacher designed projects are hard so that the student can do good in class next year. If a student thinks that summer project is hard for them, then that means the class that student will be taking is not for that student and should change the class. Teacher-designed summer assignment allows student to test their limit, allows student to be prepared, and will keep student in right track.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
CC2EAAA8FA84,"It's the end of the school year and kids and teachers are excited to leave for summer break, but what comes with that break for most schools is a dreadful summer project. Some schools decide that their students have to complete a project during the summer to make sure they are still learning even though they are not in school. People can't decide if the projects should be teacher or student designed projects. I think they should be student designed in order for the students to get the most out of the learning.

If students think of the blueprint of their project then they will be better able to understand it. Having students make their own project challenges them to know how to find their own information. They are forced to learn about a whole topic by doing their own research and completing it on their own. All the teachers have to do is give them a certain criteria to make sure they are all learning the correct information that they need to complete the projects. It is more beneficial for the students to get their information first hand to get the most out of learning.

Some people think that the projects should be teacher designed. They think that if the students have the control that they either won't get it done or won't get it done correctly. The project won't get done efficiently and it would've been a waste of time for them to do it anyways. Having the teachers give them the information will assure that the students get what they need to better understand the subject. When the teacher designs the layout of the project it is easier for them to show the students how it should be done correctly.

When doing their summer project, students still are using their brain so they can continue to be used to the learning atmosphere. Students are still getting work done during the break without getting lazy. When kids have a long break from school it is hard for them to get back in the dynamic of going back to school. They get so used to having that break that their brains aren't ready to start doing work again. By having them learn and create their own summer project their brains will still be somewhat used to learning for when school comes back in session.

Having students get more into their learning benefits them in so many ways. Summer projects are a great way for students to keep learning, especially if they themselves design how they think it should be. They get the chance to get ahead in their school learning for the upcoming school year by doing everything themselves. Having students that can teach themselves benefits them while they can still learn from others. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

Every student looks forward to summer, it's the time when you get to have fun and not be stressed out about homework. However, some teachers give summer projects that need to be completed. Students dread doing these because they feel like it's taking time away from what is supposed to be their break from school. Sometimes it's necessary for schools to assure students continue to learn during their summer break. However, summer projects should be student-designed because it gives them more responsibility, it's a way for students to express themselves, and there is a higher chance of completion.

Firstly, if students are in charge of their own summer projects it gives them more responsibility. Having a summer project is a responsibility on its own because most students don't want to worry about school while they are on their break, but giving students the chance to create their own can teach them more than if a teacher were to create the project. For example, if students would like to learn more and challenge themselves, they are going to make their projects more difficult, which can help their future education. Letting students take control can also teach them time management because they need time to create their project, complete it and enjoy their summer. It is obvious that letting students create their own project is more beneficial because it gives them more responsibility.

Secondly, giving students a chance to design their own project can help them express themselves. A student is more likely to do an assignment if it involves something they are interested in. If an English teacher were to give a book to read over the summer and write a summary about it, most students would not complete it or put no effort into it. Students don't want to spend their summer writing essays. If students were in control of the project they could use a hobby or talent to complete the assignment. For example, some students find producing videos interesting, so they could create a trailer of the book summarizing it instead of writing an essay. This shows letting students show off their creativity can make a summer project enjoyable.

Finally, letting students come up with their own project, that they can personalize, will make them want to complete it. If a teacher were to do it, they would procrastinate or not finish it. Every student procrastinates, it's just part of being in school. When summer comes around students forget about everything that is school related.

School is the last thing students think about when they're on break, so summer projects should be something students want to do, and will enjoy doing so they don't forget about it. Obviously if students design a summer project that fits their interests they're more likely to complete it.

Many would say that students wouldn't learn from creating their own project because students would make it too easy, and it would make it hard for teachers to grade. However, students learn at different paces and have different abilities. Hence why giving every student the same project is not fair because some might be spending more time of their break working on it than others. As if the students had the ability to design it, they know what they're capable of, and how much they can learn from the assignment. When it comes to grades, teachers should have a rubric and as long as students have what's necessary for the project then it won't be difficult to grade. Also, letting students come up with their summer projects would give teachers less work to do. Students should have the chance to design their own summer project because it can make both the teachers's and students' lives easier.

In conclusion, students can express themselves, complete the assignment on time, have more responsibilities and prepare for the future, if they are able to design their own summer project. A couple months before school ends all they can think about is summer, how close they are to being done with school. Except they are not because they have a summer project to work on, but if they are able to design it then it will be more beneficial. Creating a summer project will benefit the student more than doing one designed by the teacher. Schools should consider this preposition because it makes it easier for the teacher and enjoyable for the student.            ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
2FF6C7542D18,"As students grow older, they will be assigned an appropriate amount of responsibilities, such as schoolwork and projects; even some that are meant to be completed by the first day of school. Summer project can be intimidating to some students, however, summer projects are only meant to benefit the students. The benefits of summer projects include: the continuation of study and time management skills, as well as reading and writing. There is a simple solution that could be put in effect by the school officials and administration; allowing students to design their own projects based off a topic that peaks their interest. Allowing students to design their own projects will significantly increase the interest level and positive feedback that will be the deciding factor in whether or not the project is assigned the next year. The interest level and feedback received will be based off of the following: if students are given the opportunity to conduct research that they find intriguing, not what their teacher finds intriguing; their final project will be significantly better than if the project was teacher-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed in order to allow students to focus on a topic that they are passionate about, to allow students to continue learning important skills, and to allow students to share a topic that they find interesting.

Discovering passions may be difficult at a young age, however, if students are given the opportunity to focus on a topic that they find passion in, it will create a well-done project. Passions could include: athletics, academics, or an extra curricular; such as music, band, or the arts. A student-designed project will let students study a topic that they are interested in. If students are interested in what they are studying or researching, then there is a increased chance of students truly enjoying the project. As mentioned about, a student-designed project will allow for a quality project. The more say students have regarding their schoolwork, the better the outcome of that work. Personally, when given the chance to chose the topic or project guideline, there is a much better result than when given a strict outline. Typically, summer projects appear to be a burden for some students, however, students will not see a project about their passions as a concern.

Student-designed projects will allow students to learn important skills that are relevant to both them and their learning styles. Study skills, such as spacing out workdays and time management, are skills that students will continue to use as they further their education. Scheduling workdays is a simple way to reduce stress, and a way for students to not feel overwhelmed. Time management goes along with spacing out workdays because it will prevent students from cramming in the project the night before it is due. If students leave the project until the last minute, the result will not be pleasing and it would be a waste of an opportunity for students to find one of their true passions. Students will also be given the opportunity to learn the proper way to research their topic. This is yet another skill that students will use as they continue their education. Learning how to start researching and then learning what can be cut out is a challenging process that students can learn through the process of trial and error. Students will be able to take the research from various reliable resources, and develop their project, while learning an additional skill: project design. Designing a project so it is appealing to most and finding what is most convenient for you is important because it will allow future projects to be completed in an effective and efficient manner.

Student-designed project will also allow students to get to know each other, work on public speaking and presentation skills, and will show students topics of interest. Projects that are controlled by the student will allow icebreaker activities to run smoothly. Icebreaker activities are typically included in the first day of school, and they allow students to get to know each other and their teacher. If every student came prepared to share their presentation, they they would not only learn something about their fellow classmates, but they would also get the chance to work on their public speaking and presentation skills. Public speaking may be one of the most relevant and commonly used skills as you enter higher education and the workforce, as it is something that is hard to avoid. The more it is practiced, the more comfortable people, in this case, student will get with it. Students can also use this project as a starting to point to see where they might what to take their future. Deciding classes for the next school year, or even thinking about a college major can be difficult and intimidating. However, if students know their passions and interests, then the process will seem significantly less worrisome. A way to reduce the stress on making decision such as classes or college, is to let students discover their interests through student-designed projects.

If summer projects are fully designed by students, then students will be able to focus on their passions, improve their study skills, and share a topic that they find interesting. Revealing the topics that students find passion in will lead to a quality projects, a head start in determining courses and majors, and will serve as a way to learn necessary skills for college and the workforce. The more opportunities students are given to decide what they want to study or complete a project about will allow students to find those passions, such as sports, a specific class, or a certain type of art or drama. Student-designed project will also let students learn the skills that are most useful for them, for instance: time management or public speaking. Most importantly, students will be able to discover who they truly are through a project that they design. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
EE153BA22CAB,"Lately summer projects are becoming popular to assure students are learning during the break. There is an ongoing debate over as to whether summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Some may believe summer projects should be teacher-designed, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, summer projects should be designed by the students.

There are a variety of reasons why summer projects should be student-designed. Student-designed projects can reveal an individuals character. For example, an athlete can turn in a sports related project, but it may not be the most organized. This gives the teacher the ability to know what kind of student they are looking forward to teaching. Also, these projects can build a students creativity. Working on summer projects allows students to have more than enough time to brainstorm and come up with something creative. A teacher-designed project can not be as creative, because the rubric has to accommodate every student. Another reason is the projects will increase the students desire to complete the project. With the student creating their own projects it will boost their confidence levels. Also, the teacher will be satisfied because more people will finish the project.

There are additional reasons why students should design the summer projects. This will allow the students to bring in a variety of ideas and projects. For instance, one student could have a 3-D project and the other could have a PowerPoint. The students will likely compare and contrast their projects, which will result in students learning new skills for future tasks. Also,this will give the students a challenge. Designing a project is not the easiest task, especially for a child. It also helps the students learn how to persevere and overcome a challenge. Lastly, these projects will teach students how to learn on their own and become independent. Becoming independent and learning on your own are vital skills needed when moving forward in life. For example, in college you do everything on your own, your professor probably will not even know your name.

Although some may disagree, summer projects should be student-designed. There are a plethora of reasons to support this notion: it reveals personality and character, builds creativity, and challenges students. In this era we tend to shy away from traditional ways, so why not let the projects be student-designed and change things up a bit.         ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
1D0DD38A4428,"School, a crucial building block of a child's life where one finds them self. Year in and year out students are forced to be condemned to these dreary halls where information is crammed into their brains 7 hours a day, five days a week. But there's a small period in every year that students get a much-needed break, that being summer vacation. A few months in the heat of the year students take a break from school to regroup themselves and spend tie with their friends and family. In order to retain the information that students have obtained throughout the year, and keep their minds active teachers will assign books to read and projects to complete before the school year starts. These summer projects however, are time, energy, and effort spent during what is supposed to be a child's vacation so you would think that the student should be able to do something that they are interested in, right? Summer projects should be student designed because of the time, skill, and effort that will be displayed differently by every student.

In order to get the brain back into the school mode for students, it takes time. Time vary between everybody because no one is on the same schedule. One person that has done nothing all summer will have a lot more time to complete a good, well thought project, versus someone that's been away at sleep away camp all summer. Why should it be the teachers right to decide how much time you should be able to get on a project they assigned having no idea about your plan for the summer? If a student was allowed to make their own project based on what they have time for, the project will be a lot better than if they crammed a ton of information they are not prepared for with that small amount of time. Projects would not only be neater, but more sophisticated because they did what they could do with the time they set aside. No one teacher could possibly know how much time you have, but also the true amount of skill that you also possess.

Going into the year the teacher does not really know what you can do from an academic standpoint yet so why should they assume your skill with a before school, summer project? In order for a teacher to get a feel to where your ability level lies, they must first get to know you and see your potential. A project that is assigned to one student could be in someone's wheel house, while another kid could really struggle on the subject that the project is on. There is no way of knowing unless the project is driven by what the student wants and what the student is able to achieve. Students should be able to harness their abilities for their summer project that will also display their effort.

Effort for school in the summer is not something that any student would want to do. Being cooped up inside doing a project for school instead of going to the pool with your friends is something that I'm willing to bet, no kid would choose to do. If students were allowed to choose their summer project they might be more willing to put in effort versus some boring, strict guidelines thing that a teacher would assign. Effort is hard to get out of a kid during the long, dog days of summer, so how can you expect them to put in their effort on something they know is painful and creativity destroying? The effort shown from students still might not be sufficient, but it will be better if it's something the kid wants to do, and not just assigned from a teacher. Kids want freedom, and with freedom to decide your project thats due at the end of summer vacation only seems right. If you're going to make students work on their vacation at least let them do it by their standards, and don't just tell them blatantly what to do.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
BB5E6A8A2420,"Many students use their summer vacation as a time to relax and forget the stress of school. In doing so, many of them come back to school only to find that they have forgotten a good amount of what they had learned the previous year. Teachers have found that a good way that they can overcome this problem is by assigning projects for students to complete over their vacation. However, the way in which these projects are designed could either accomplish that goal or make students dread returning to school even more. Summer projects should be student-designed, because it allows students to showcase their creativity, fosters leadership skills, and ensures that students are interested in what they are learning.

Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to showcase their creativity. By allowing students to choose their own project and design it however they see fit, students will be opened up to a whole new spectrum of ideas to explore. Instead of being stuck doing the same old PowerPoint or essay, students can come up with something new that not only is fun to make, but is fun for the class to watch. Earlier this year I was assigned to do a project in which we had to create a PowerPoint on a scientist. By the time the class had watched two PowerPoints, we found ourselves bored and no longer paying attention. Every project was the same thing with a different name tacked onto it. Later in the year we were allowed to do a project in which we could create any form of visual media that we wanted. Come presentation day, we found ourselves excited to showcase the creative videos and songs we had made.

Summer projects should be student-designed because it fosters leadership skills in students. When students are assigned projects by their teachers it puts them in a routine in which they only stick to the instructions that were assigned. If students were instead allowed to come up with a project on their own, they would be taught how to explore outside of a set of rules and create something themselves. I was always a shy person growing up, and loved when I would be given a set of rules that I could follow and not have to stray from. However, once I was given the opportunity to create a project myself to present to the class at the end of the year, I found myself start to break out of the shell I had created for myself. Being allowed to design my own project gave me a way to do things according to my own rules instead of those set by others and learn what it meant to be in charge of what I was doing.

Summer projects should be student-designed because it ensures that students will be interested in what they are learning. When students are given the opportunity to choose a project for themselves, they will find themselves more invested in their work. My biology class once was assigned a project in which we had to find some way to tell the story of DNA. After completing the projects, we would be given a test on it. Our class found that, after completing the projects in the way that we wanted to, we were actually more interested in learning how everything worked. It was no surprise that our class got the highest grade average on that test.

Some may argue that allowing students to chose their own projects might result in projects that are sub par, or not up to the standards that the teachers are looking for. However, simply revising the idea with the teacher before starting the project would easily help in overcoming this problem. When students are allowed to tap into their creativity and come up with their own projects, teachers are helping students learn to express themselves and stand out from others. When we allow students to discover who they are, we are teaching them more than a teacher-designed project ever could. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
D4E3104E7591,"To assure students are continuing to learn over the summer, some schools assign summer projects. A school summer project should be teacher designed even though it puts more work onto a teachers part, but it is better than getting poor projects from confused students in the beginning of a school year. Projects already bring stress to students, especially since its summer and all students want to do is hangout with friends or do anything school related. Having a teacher design the project is both relieving and easier, because the student has a foundation of what to do, they meet the requirements needed from the teacher, and so that they do not waste time on a project that may not even be right.

If the student has a based foundation of what to do to begin with, the project already becomes easier to do. With guide lines already set up, the student can continue forth and begin the project successfully. Let us say it was a textbook reading and project based on the reading. Students, for the most part, do not generally enjoy reading pages on pages on pages; however, if a teacher gives a blank statement about what to do, the readings become difficult for the student to comprehend. In a students mind, it can go many different ways to think about a project. Having a teacher design a project base gives the student more to go off of instead of a teacher saying ""Read these pages and submit a project by the beginning of the school year"" is not helpful. By giving a foundation of the project, the student can succeed and be more efficient.

Meeting the requirements of any project whether it is during the school year or outside in daily life is so important, because the requirements is where a person is scored based on their work provided. For a student, requirements are on a rubric which helps guide the way of a assignment or project. For an example, writing essays are difficult in a way of being confident in their work. Usually reverting to guide lines given by the teacher help boost the confidence of work to submit. Receiving requirements by a teacher give assurance to the student by being able to look and see if they have missed anything or gotten all requirements checked off. For a student, being able to receive such assurance relieves us of stress. The stress will always be there, but some of it would have disappeared.

If a summer project was student based, a lot of students would be unsure and confused on what to do. Students do not want to waste time on a project they have no idea what to do. It is both a waste of the students time, but also a waste of the teachers time by grading projects that are not correct. Also, student based projects have a variety of choices and decisions on whether or not a project is good or bad. Like if a reading was about a mall and how it effects the choice a student has on how to spend time, there are many directions a project could go from there. Students as a whole could easily waste time on a project by procrastinating, but usually it is because they are not sure on what to do. There will always be a student who does not finish in time or even starts it, but those who try and do work efficiently tend to do better time wise. Instead of wasting a student and a teachers time, it is better to have a foundation of a project given by a teacher than having everything be up to and decided by the student.

Having a teacher designed project is beneficial to both a student and a teacher. Work gets put into from both sides, the teacher and the student, to produce an amazing outcome of a project that meets requirements, was time efficient, and also gets the idea of the project. If it were to be the opposite and were to be student based, it would have had a fifty to fifty chance of it having a good or bad project that could not meet requirements, wasted time, and did not get the point of the project. The sole reason of a summer project is to show a student learning, if the project was not good, the project had no affect on the students learning. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
DC8F1803CAA3,"Why waste time doing a project over the summer, that you had no part in deciding how it was designed? Summer, is a time of self enjoyment, and should be a break from school and doing boring assignments. However, teachers tend to assign students projects to do over the summer. With this in mind, many times teachers would assign projects that would take too much time and cause students to end up not doing it. This means, projects should be designed by students. At first, if students come up with their own projects, they can make it a reasonable amount of work where it does not stress them out to the point where they don't do it, but not terribly short and are able to finish it in 10 minutes. Next, having students design the project, allows them to control what they would like to learn and remember over the summer. Finally, giving students control, would increases the number of summer projects being completed.

First, procrastination is a very big problem on students. In countless cases, students in the Generic_City area, have a big summer project, and either do not know about it, or decide not to do it. For example, in the case of a student named Generic_Name, he had an English book report due over the summer. He was not informed by the teachers, so he never ended up doing it. This ended up causing him to start off at a lower grade the following year. If summer projects were student ran, he would have known that there was a summer project, and could of planned accordingly. In other cases, such as a student named Generic_Name, he knew about his English report by word of mouth, but decided not to do it because it was more work he felt the work load was overwhelming. If the students had designed the project, they could of made the project be a healthy amount of work that students know they could do it in a comfortable amount of time.

Next, one of the reasons on why student's tend to be very unprepared going into next year's class is, because they learn nothing from these projects. These projects that are given by teachers do not require them to learn anything to complete it. For example, a science teacher named Generic_Name, gave his students a big 20 page packet about rocks that he found online to do over the summer. He hopes this packet will teach them everything they need to know for the next year and get them ready. However, he is oblivious to his students taking advantage of this, and simply look up the answers online and be done with it. The whole point of the project would be wasted if students can just look up answers or copy it from a friend .The entire learning aspect from doing the project is negated. For example, if students could design it, they could have a project that would require students to find different types of rocks outside their home, take a picture of it ,and write a small description about it. This would accomplish the goal of a summer project. Giving students a way to learn about topics of the class in the summer, and disable the act to copy since everyone would have different types of pictures.

Finally, giving students the steering wheel for summer projects, would drastically increase the number of completed projects. A big reason why thousands of summer projects each year, were not being done, is because the students do not feel the project is worth their time. For example, why would you do a boring math packet over the summer, when you could just go to the beach and forget about it. Students have no emphasis on doing these projects. Now, if students had input on the project, they could make it something they seem worthy of doing, and put the time and effort into finishing it. This would help the students learn new information during the summer, and encourage more students to do the projects.

In conclusion, students should have control of summer projects and decide on how to do it. There are many reasons why this should be the case. Firstly, students can come up with projects that do not require them to stress about, and still actually finish them. Secondly, they could choose what they want to learn about over the summer, that way they don't waste the time copying their friends project and learn nothing. Lastly, the number completed projects would increase if students were given the creative license and control over their summer assignment. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
36DF4C0101F2,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Although summer break is a time for students and teachers to relax, it is still important for students to continue learning. Coming back from summer break can be hard on students because they usually have not done any work at home. Something that could help students stay actively learning is a summer project. Opponents wrongly believe summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers would chose a project that stays on the curriculum and all students would be doing the same project. Although some may believe summer projects should be teacher designed, it should be known summer projects should be student designed.

There are a few short term benefits from students designing their own projects. Students are more likely to do a better job on the project if they are student designed. If the student picks what he is doing his project on he is more likely to do a better job on it. For example, when I get a project that is teacher designed I am less likely to put effort into it. It gets students more excited about doing work when they are familiar with the topic. This would also benefit students because they know what they are capable of doing. Students might have to spend money on a project because they do not have the materials for the project that the teacher assigned. For example, I find it easier to do projects on subjects that I'm well aware of. It would be easier on the student if they could do a project within their limits. Students would have a much more enjoyable experience if they were allowed to design the project. Usually when students have a good time doing work they do a better job on it. For example, when my elementary school did science fairs the students always got to pick the topic we used in the project, it was much more enjoyable than when the teacher picked it. There is no point in students doing a project they are not passionate about.

There are also long term benefits from students designing their own projects. Students designing their own projects can help teach them creativity. Students always have to follow exactly what the teacher says and that leaves no room for creativity. For example, every time I get to design my own projects I discover new artistic abilities I never knew I had. This can help students in the future by reminding them not everything has to come out of a book and it is okay to have original ideas. Another long term benefit would be protecting students self esteem. If a student is struggling to complete a project that the teacher assigned it could lower their self esteem. For example, I have had many projects that have made me feel like I was not as smart as the other students because I did not understand the work. A build up of failed attempts could lead to students doubting themselves and giving up, however if the student designs their own project they are more likely to succeed. Lastly, it gives students a chance to be independent. Little things like simply designing their own project can go a long way. For example, I always feel better after accomplishing a project that I designed by myself. Over time students could develop real world skills from simply designing their own projects.

Although some may believe summer projects should be teacher designed, it should be known summer projects should be student designed. The opposition incorrectly believes summer projects should be teacher designed because kids will struggle to find something to do and teachers know what they need to learn. Summer projects should be student designed because they will do a better job on it, students know what they are capable of doing, and it is more enjoyable. Additionally, it teaches creativity, boosts self esteem, and it gives students the chance to be independent. Schools should take this into serious consideration so students can stay activley learning in an easy way while also having fun doing it.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
A09916887199,"Students should be able to design their own summer project because, it give them a chance to have something to look forward to in the summer. Also it would help them get a chance at experiencing their own creativity. Students would be able to have that feeling that they are able to take on the responsibility. They would be able to learn more if they can designed it all on their own. For must students they dont really look forward to doing project but if you give them a chance to do it on their own they might get into it.

First, designing your own project as a student it give you something to look forward to in the summer. Most students stay home for the summer with nothing to do. So, if you give a student a chance to design their own project for the summer it give them a chance to do something. Students would be able to explore more if they design their own project. With exploring their not sitting at home eating a bag of chips watching Netflix they are actually being active and moving around.

Although, most teachers believes it is a bad idea for students to design they own project because they believe they will not take it seriously. It actually the opposite half of any schools in the world may have students who is into art or into designing things. It would give students a chance to express their own creativity. Most students love the thought of making their own projects. They would learn more and discover more with making their own project and designing it the way that they prefer it to be.

Also, letting students design their won project would let them discover more. With discovering they are able to learn more and see thing that they never seen. Example say your in are and you art teacher give you a summer project. And that project is to take a pic of what you think expresses people in the world. You would have to get out your comfort zone to do that like going outside. it would also be a better way to communicate with people to gain information for your project.

Furthermore, teachers would want for their students to take on that responsibility to prove that they are ready to work for their grade. It would also give kids the feeling that they are capable of taking on the responsibility of proving to there teacher next year that they are responsible. Kids have a hard time showing that they can do stuff in a responsible manner. So, giving kids that responsibility of designing their project it's letting them know that it is their job to make sure they have everything they need for the project and knowing that they are capable of doing that. It would teach kids that even though it is summer your still able to learn and have responsibilities.

With that being said it is a good idea for kids to be able to design their own summer project because they are still learning. And they would have something to look forward to when summer comes. It would be a great way to experience their creativity. Also, students are able to prove to themselves and teacher that they are responsible. Letting students design their own project could give them a chance to discover and have a chance to express their own creativity.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
2D30BE5A3A1A,"Are you excited for the summer? Finally having warm weather again, going to the beach and spending the free days with friends and family? Students cannot wait for summer break. Nevertheless, school should not be completely forgotten; therefore, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. That helps students to catch up with their classes and to be ready to go back in the fall. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know their students and can help them individually, teachers have been students when they were younger and have experience and many students are too lazy and unorganized to pick a project by themselves.

Not everyone would agree with that position. Some may argue that summer projects should be student-designed because students can tell what they need to study to be ready for the next school year. No one knows better than themselves what they are good at and where they need to improve. For example, Generic_Name is going to do a summer project in 2020. She organizes all by herself because she knows what she needs to catch up with. Generic_Name can combine her interests with learning and is going to be ready for the next school year with a student-designed project.

Nevertheless, there are other viewpoints to consider.

To begin with, summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know their students and can help them individually. For example, my aunt is a high school teacher and her students have to do a project during summer break. She teaches biology and knows her students very well. She gives them a topic for the summer project, which includes specific learn methods for every student. This shows that teachers can help their students individually and know what they need to catch up with to start positive in the new grade and not already be lost in the beginning of the year.

In addition, teachers have been students themselves when they were younger. They have experience about summer projects and can help students to organize them. For example, when Generic_Name, a teacher at Generic_School, gives summer projects, he can help his students a lot because he had to go through the same things when he was a student, but now he knows the best way how to handle those summer projects and can bring his experience to the students.

Finally, many students are too lazy and unorganized to pick the project and give directions to themselves. They might choose an easy project that they already know about, so they would not learn about something new and waste their time. For example, in the book ""Conni & Co"", the main character Conni has to do her summer project by herself without any help. She tries her best. She makes a plan and is motivated before the break starts. It turns out that her plan is very unorganized and she spends almost everyday of her break with her friends but does not focus on her project. She also picks a topic about horses, which she is very familiar with and thinks she does not need so much time because of that. Conni starts the night before the first day of school ,but, obviously, it is too late and she ends up with not finishing her project. That movie is the perfect example that summer projects should be teacher-designed because with the help of teachers students can get more organized, learn more and can get their work done.

In conclusion, summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers know their students and can help them individually, teachers have been students when they were younger and have experience and many students would be too lazy and unorganized to pick a project by themselves. Teachers know how to organize those projects and make them learn effective for the students. So if your school requires you to complete summer projects, ask your teachers. They would love to help you continue learning during the break and want only the best for your future.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
A2816855FB22,"Although the students being able to design their own summer project sounds great, it's better to leave it up to the teachers so that they can have all the required information, add an appropriate amount of work and properly introduce the subject for the following year. The idea of a student designing their own project is to give the student a little freedom. By allowing them to design it, teachers are able to see if students are capable of adding enough requirements based on what they've done on previous ones over the past years.

One of the main reasons why deciding to let the teachers create the summer projects would be a great idea is because the teacher would know how much information would be needed for when the students present in class. The presentation needs to have enough information so that the class can learn something from each students' project. That's how you know it's properly made is when the students can take something home from what they learned in school. I remember my freshman year of high school my class had to design their own project rubric and the class failed to add certain typical required tasks. The projects were not as informational as they were thought out to be and that led to the students being confused during the presentations.

Another reason why the teachers should probably be designing the summer projects is because they know the appropriate amount of work to give the students and when to lay back. Most of the time students don't want to do a lot of work and that's very understandable, but a lot of times nine out of the ten would try do as least work as possible. For example, in eighth grade I had a history teacher that allowed the students to create their own study guides, so knowing how lazy most of them were, they did the least amount of work as possible. The following class, we had our test on certain events that happened during the great depression and most of the students either failed or got a low grade due to the lack of work and information we had on our study guides. From then on the class was required to complete the study guides that were made by the teacher.

The third and final reason why it's better to have the teachers design summer projects is because the teacher is the only person that could properly introduce the subject. In the beginning of each year, teachers inform their students on how the class would run and how the assignments would be graded. I'd say all the teachers that I have had over the years but one, have properly introduced how the class would run and how the work would be presented. I had a history teacher in seventh grade that had an accent that I couldn't quite understand and I was clueless about where she might have been from. The first day of school was going well until I got to history, I had no idea what she was saying, she seemed very disorganized, and she was always forgetting what she wanted to get to for class. She wasn't very clear on how the work was going to be graded and she would have us take our own notes, which I don't mind but it didn't help that I couldn't understand her. I went the entire year guessing what she was saying and worried about what type of assignments i'd be getting.

Even though most students would prefer to design their own summer projects because of how much control they'd have on the work required or just simply wanting to do it themselves, it could be very beneficial for the students if teacher designed it for them. The teachers would be the best people to add in all the information needed for proper and factual presentations and they'd be able to balance the amount of work. Most importantly the teachers would be able to introduce the subject the best, for the students' to understand how assignments would be during the school year.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
2F92C7B52712,"Once school is over summer vacation starts, but not everyone is free from the work they have to do for school. Some schools believe that it is important to assign summer projects so our minds are ready for the next year. But I believe it's unfair for teachers to decide what our project is about. That's why I believe that summer projects should be created by the student and not the teacher because the student should love what their topic is about and it would give the student a sense of pride and confidence to know they can accomplish a solo project. But I also think that the teacher-designed project would be more organized.

The first reason I chose is that the student should be passionate about the topic. I believe that if a student has to do a project they don't like then the project won't be good. If you are a high school student who enjoys driving/fixing cars, and your teacher gives you a summer project about cars, you would probably feel really confident about it and start right away. But most likely, your teacher is going to give you a project on

How To Kill a Mockingbird and your going to feel really stressed and/or nervous. I remember once in my life, one of my coaches told me that ""If your mind is not ready to lead, then your body won't follow."" Even thought he was probably talking about executing the physical and mental tolls of playing a sport, it fits right in with what i'm talking about. If a student is not passionate or doesn't love their project, then there's not really a source of motivation that's making them do it. This could lead to weeks and even months of felling stressed, nervous, feeling uncomfortable with the subject, and even procrastination. This could also lead the student to believing that they are stupid or unfit to continue in advanced level classes, which I know that no teacher wants that to happen to any of their students.

The second reason I chose is that it would make the student really proud of themselves if they knew that they could create, produce, and execute a project all by themselves. I believe that if a person has full artistic control over a project, then they will be happy with their product and satisfied with their effort. It's the same feeling when a woodworker makes a table, or a home cook makes a cake from scratch. You can buy any of theses items at a store, but it's the feeling that you have the power to make it with your hands and your imagination and that's exactly how I want the students to feel. When I was 10th grade, every single tenth grader had to complete a project called the MYP (Mid-Year Personal Project). Many of the upper class men called it one of the hardest projects you'll ever do in high schools, and many of them said they didn't pass it, so I was very nervous. Even though it wasn't a summer project it still nearly six months to complete, but when I was done I was very happy with the work I did. When I was done I was also happy with the score I received, but the only reason I got that score was because the teacher allowed us to pick a topic you were either interested/passionate about and the topic I picked was coins. This also ties back into my previous talking point. If a student completes a project that they created, then they will get a sense of pride. This could lead to a boost in confidence, an increase of knowledge, and a stronger work ethic. This could also be enough to persuade them that their smart enough to compete with the other kids.

The third reason I picked, however, was that teachers have a better ability to organize a project. Even with all the proof I have given above, teachers still have a knowledgeable advantage over students. If a student starts a project and the first thing they do is research, they can be overwhelmed with all the information they received and not know how to organize it. Plus, if you think about all the ways you can choose to display your information it can get confusing. But when teachers give you a project, they most likely have everything already set for you so you can do your project. This includes what the bases of the projects about, how you have to display your project, what cites you can/can't use, and they'll even give you a rubric so you can compare what you have to what score you might get. You also can't forget how much time, money, and effort teachers have put into getting a degree in their field, so they know what their talking about.

Based on the information that I have just explained above are why students should create their own summer project. The reasons are that a student should love the topic that their researching and completing their own project would give student the sense of accomplishment that they can do bigger things. But we also have to think about how teachers are very thorough when it comes to assignments and they probably have everything planned out.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
A7D3E138D9E4,"Some schools require the students to do a project during the summer to assure that the students are still learning during the break. I think that is dumb because the kids are supposed to have a break from school during the summer but i am going to side with the student designed projects. The reason i am siding with student designed is because i am a student myself and I know that students are able to make projects that are fun and still show that They are continuing to learn while they are not at school. One big example of students working on a project they designed is a science project they are not told what to do in it or how to do it by a teacher all they know is decide what to do, then get the materials, then execute the project and then bring it back to school so that goes to show that students can decide what to do for their project. Some people may say that, teachers need to design the students projects so they need to know what to do so they don't get off track but however they are wrong because there are a lot of bright students that don't need a teacher's help with a lot of things and im pretty sure that they don't need help on deciding on something as simple as a project that can be anything that they want.

Schools that don't let the students decide on anything are holding them back on what could be their next future job or career, so schools that let students decide on things are trying to help them reach that potiental so they could decide for themselves on a lot of thing and don't have to have someone tell them they have to do this a certain type of way so at the same time its not just letting them decide on what they want to do for a project they are giving them the freedom to decide what they want to do so when they leave school there is no one that have to tell them what to do every step of the way. But for the schools that have to decide for the students everyday without letting them choose for themselves that is not really helping the students really because when they have to do something by themselves they are going to need someone to coach them through life and show them simple things that could be easily understood but the can't do that be cause in school they had someone to do all deciding for them.

In conclusion, let the students decide their projects so they can do something for themselves and not have the assignment handed to them. The IB personal project can be used for another example of a student designed project. With the IB personal project it takes months because it requires a lot of steps for each individuals project, first you have to plan and decide what you are going to do for that project, second you have to execute the plan and keep up with it so you can write about it, third you have to write a 3000 word paper about the project explaining what you did and how you did it, fourth you have to print out everything you did and put it on a poster board, and finally you have to wait until march 17 for the IB person project fair where you have to present your project to all the family members and friends that will be attending. Some people may say that just because you let students decide what they are goign to do with a project doesn't mean that they wont be depending on someone to help them in life but however they are wrong because that little piece of freedom to decide what they are going to do on a project is getting one step closer to be a self depending person.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
4A5760917477,"The distinct responsibility of having students learn rests on the very shoulders of teachers throughout nine out of the twelve months that are in a year, so the students should direly be permitted to design how they learn over the three month break that they get. This three month break, summer, to most students, is a time where they can finally let go of all their responsibilities and worries and leave them right in the classroom. Most do not think twice about what they have learned over the past semester, but instead are already steps ahead on planning what events. attractions, and/or vacations they may embark on. Teachers still try to make an effort for learners to still store information they have learned and even try add on to it by assigning projects that are aimed directly for students to complete by the next school year. More often than not, projects are long-term, and that causes the student to be continuously involved with the material and truly grasp the knowledge coming at them. Summer projects should be student-designed due to the fact that they are more likely to retain the knowledge, it lets them express their creativity and uniqueness, and finally they would be more inclined to complete the project.

When a student does a project that is created by them, they have to think outside of the box and really put an effort to make a project that caters towards themselves. Every student will be likely to design a different version of the project and there will be no barriers to how they can let their creative minds visualize the project and ultimately complete it. Having them let their brain-storming abilities to take over and conceptualize on how they will continue to tackle the task at hand, truly sets them up for active learning and teaches them very useful future skills that they will use. Varying on the topic, students can create physical projects such as posters or tri-folds, or they can create online projects such as graphs or tables. Having the ability to express your mind is something that can not be so easily undermined or the very learning that is so emphasized in today's educational system will have failed.

To actually learn an individual needs to be able to understand the knowledge that is going through their mind as they work on assignments, and there is truly no better way to learn than to self-learn while working on a project. Unlike tests or any other sort of assignment, projects give students more of a chance to actually learn rather than just memorizing knowledge for a sort period of time and then forgetting it the second they turn in the assignment. Making sure that their mind is continuously being subjected to complete the assignment over a long period of time consequently burns the knowledge into their brain and helps them to better retain it. Having students do the designing portion of the assignment as well would lead to even more learning due to them needing to know the content first and then being able to correctly complete it with no errors. Having the responsibility of creating and then completing an assignment can only lead to more mind involvement which would lead to learning and would ultimately lead to retaining.

Producing the best possible work can only come through the prosperity of motivation and the willingness to do the work. Students often look at summer assignments as needless work that a teacher wants them to complete for a grade, but if they were to honestly enjoy the work they were creating and completing then their effort would truly be expressed through their work. Having that passion to finish and be proud with the work that they complete is the leading factor for high grades, and also causes high amounts of knowledge to be learned. Trying to just rush through an assignment made by a teacher can be dreadful, but when doing a student-designed project they must take their time and fully comprehend all that is going on in it. People such as Bill Gates can be a perfect example of displaying this sort of passion and then having their work speak for the amount of effort they put in, or else Microsoft would not be one of the top companies in the world.

Being able to learn and retain knowledge, express themselves in countless ways, and want to actually complete the assignment are all reasons why student-designed projects prove to be more resourceful and efficient in the life of a typical student. However, teacher-designed projects are helpful too, they teach exactly what the teacher would teach them in class which gives learners an understanding of the content from the teachers perspective and could possibly give them knowledge on material they do not know. Learning is retaining, if the students do not retain any of the knowledge they are just trying to complete another teacher-given assignment, and they are not truly learning. Summer is not only a time of fun and enjoyment, but is also is a time for students to get a step ahead and continue their journey to pursue their dreams, which can only come from one ability, learning.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0

I asked "" It's just that while you are at the beaches I have to be here, at home, doing my summer assignments"". Generic_Name brought up a good point, many schools in the United States require their students, or at least expect them to practice their acquired knowledge from the year throughout their summer vacations. These assignments can vary in description from online activities to summer long projects,consequently, bringing up the questions of who gets to design such tasks? Is it the students that ultimately are the ones completing the assignment, or is it the teacher?. Without a doubt, teachers should be the ones that design the assignments because they have more experience and know their students strengths and weaknesses.

Students should not design summer assignments, but instead teachers should because they have more experience from their teaching, learning, and experimenting throughout the years. Ms. Generic_Name is a dedicated science teacher in Generic_School, but she is also very found of summer assignments and does her best to make sure that they exemplify her knowledge to her students; furthermore, she has made it her goal to make sure that her assignments are useful and has taken classes outside of her field to make sure that they are. Continuously, Ms. Generic_Name teaches multiple classes in biology and genetics and is knows the topics that are important for students to know, therefore, her philosophy is to enforce those topics during the summer by giving students summer assignments. Lastly, she has gotten time to experiment like many other teachers have, and she knows what will work and what will not, so for her 90's class a summer long project worked because they were not unmotivated, but for her most recent class an online activity would fit best with their interest. That is why I believe that summer assignments need to be teacher design because they know how to design material that is unique to every one of their classes needs. Some people may disagree with the argument that students know what they need better because they know themselves, but their reasoning is flawed because students do not have the knowledge that teachers have gained from their hundreds of students and the years spent in college to learn how to teach. I my self was one of those students that thought that I knew how to teach my self, but I could not be further from the truth. The summer of seventh grade we were allowed to choose how we wanted to review, and it really was student designed, we could do whatever we thought would work, but when next school year came around I was in geometry and I had even forgotten how to find X. It just goes to show that students can not teach themselves. Lastly, Generic_Name a friend that attends the Generic_School agrees that having teachers design their summer assignments is great, but some professors do not assign summer assignments so its up to them to learn the material, and according to her it is clear that the students that had an assign assignment retained more information than those that were left on their own, Generic_Name even compared those unfortunate students to chickens running around with their heads chopped of, only that they had textbooks.

Teachers should design summer assignments because they have gotten to know how their students learn by being with them for almost every day for nine months. I would be lying if I said that I do not have a favorite teacher because I do, and almost every student will agree that they all have that one teacher that they feel comfortable with. Those teachers have the privilege to learn a little more from their students, but they do most of their learning in the classroom from everyone of their students, so they are able to apply their knowledge to their methods of teaching and how they assign work. Teachers are so well versed on students that they even know when their classes are not ready to take a test, my chemistry teacher knows us so well that she has postponed tests before because she knows that we had a hard time with the unit and listens to our concerns and conflicts. As a result, teachers are the best to understand students struggles and methods of learning. Although some may disagree, with retaliation on how a teacher can know everyone of their students on the basis of how the teacher has time or has the patience to do so, but the truth is that teachers spend an enormous amount of time with their students not only in class, but also after and before school. Ms. Generic_Name is one such teacher that is here before and after school, and I had never realized the amount of people in the mornings and the many more afternoon. These students got up early and gave up their afternoons to get help from her, so I do not see how she would not learn from the extra interaction with her students. Furthermore, sometimes it is the students themselves that express what they want their teachers to know, for I know I do anytime that I feel that the way the teacher is teaching something is to bizarre or to confusing I make sure they know it, and not only me but many of my classmates do too. In tenth grade my calculus teacher, Mr. Generic_Name, even made us know that all of our feedback and input was of importance to him and that he used it to make our summer assignment.

As a result from teachers designing student's summer assignments students will be able to learn and retain past and new information better. Students should not have the desire to design their own summer assignments when teachers have the knowledge both about students and material to design them. In past years these assignments have been common and they should not stop being such in the future when their main role is to help students, and is seen in the present. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
59759D9F5AFB,"Classes, such as Art, require students to complete projects over the summer. In the example of

AP

Art, their works are part of their end-of-year graded portfolio while also working to ensure that students are still prepared and ready to complete magnificent pieces over the school year. The teacher of the class should be the designer of such projects because they know the previous year's material, know what next year's material is, and they need to learn what their students understand.

While teachers may remember the material they teach to students year after year, students themselves may forget over the course of their summer break. That's where summer projects come into play; they require students to refresh their knowledge and understand it in order to apply it. A summer project designed by a student may not touch on enough material or dig deep enough to re-solidify the knowledge learned in the previous school year. In the case of the summer before Art 3, the class was assigned with going outside their comfort zone and creating at least two art pieces they were happy with. Over my summer, I got into painting. The piece I had the most trouble with took me over a month, but by the time I'd finished, I was comfortable with blending paints, color theory, and realism. Then, in Art 3, we spent an entire semester working on blending colors and realism, which I was experienced in by then. If I had not been told to leave my comfort zone, I never would've painted or practiced realism, which are both incredibly important skills in art. If I had designed my own project, I would've simply decided to further refine the skills I was more comfortable with.

Over the summer, most students relax and enjoy their homework-free life, which is why it's jarring to return to school and get homework the same day. An assigned summer project eliminates that problem by preparing students for the workload and expectations of the class. Bringing back the Art 3 summer project, our teacher wanted us to continue doodling and working on art, but he also wanted two show-worthy art pieces, which is what the class revolves around. In class we spend an entire month practically slaving over one piece. On more than one occasion, I've had to start an entire piece over from scratch after I've finished it. Teachers know the classes they teach and, with pre-class projects, help adapt students to their expectations for the actual class. While more dedicated students may prepare for their more favored classes before school starts, not every student will know what to do.

The biggest issue with returning to class after break is not understanding something. This is especially terrible if a student doesn't even know what they don't understand. If a summer project works students to properly summarize and utilize their knowledge of the class, students will see the flaws in their understanding when they can't answer certain questions or apply certain topics. For example, one of the biggest problems I faced with my painting was that I simply couldn't comprehend how to paint shadows without using inked-out lines. When I came back to school, I talked to my teacher and learned from him how to better define my painting by using shading instead of lines. I may love art, but I wouldn't naturally subject myself to the suffering that lies outside my comfort zone, at least, not without it being required.

A problem I've faced with summer projects is the lack of personalization. What I mean is that sometimes teachers assign projects that just don't fit certain people, maybe because they don't fully understand the mind of their students. Last summer, I was tasked with writing a series of short stories, each with a different requirement. While I enjoy creative writing, I suffer when tasked with short stories; I just can't put my ideas into the format. However, all students should be able to display the necessary material on a standardized plane, at least to help the teacher know what needs improvement. Due to the mixed results of the project, my teacher later taught the class how to break down a story into different aspects so that I could understand the structure like a novel-length story. Even though the project didn't properly display our fullest potential, the class was able to move forwards and learn new skills to better ourselves.

As a student, I dislike working over the summer. I'd rather spend my time working on my hobbies, spending time with my family, and forgetting about school in general. I understand the need for summer projects and appreciate it, but if I had the choice, I'd make an easy project that could be done without even cracking open a textbook or looking at my notes. Also as a student, though, I like and even enjoy understanding class material and doing good work. It's a compromise, but if a teacher assigns a project over summer, I happily do it because I trust that the teacher is doing it because it will help students. I alone cannot prepare myself for a year of next-level material, whether it be art or writing or even math. Projects help me retain the information I need for the class and keep me sharp for the work that comes with it. While I can't design the perfect project to prepare myself, I know my teacher will.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
47AB06B723A5,"Schools that require summer projects allow their students to keep actively learning. Summer projects demand research and most importantly, work ethic. These projects must be of interest to the students due to the fact it'll be done over the summer; a time where every student wishes to spend every hour of each day enjoying themselves. The self-awareness and intellect of each student will reflect through every project and show the efforts they put into their project, as well as broadening the understanding of teachers, and students, through student-designed projects.

To begin with, student-designed projects will allow each student to show their self-awareness and intellect. The generation we live in today has the extraordinary opportunity to have diverse cultures and backgrounds with different ideas and beliefs; with the help of technology, every student has a different vision of what they're interested in and what they can make of that. Unfortunately, some students are underestimated in society due to the color of their skin or heritage. Through a student-designed project, each student can make their visions come to life through their projects. For example, my friends were doing research over the summer for potential science fair projects. While some were doing this for a good grade, others were doing this for a reason that sparked interest in them. I've seen multiple science fair projects on the topic of cancer or ways to obtain clean water. Although it is just a project, they've been inspired because they've either had ill family members or came from third-world countries that had scarce resources. Furthermore, they began pondering of how this could help them and the millions of other people in the world. These student-designed projects allow students to show their intellect and understanding of the world around them.

Secondly, the efforts of each student will be seen clearly through student-designed projects. Naturally, we are pulled to things that interest us more, especially during the summer. Every student sees the summer as a way to slack off and spend their days doing activities that interest them. Thus, a project that interests a student will likely catch their attention and lead them to work harder on said project. For instance, if your boss nags at you to complete a project during your vacation days and it doesn't spark interest in you, chances are you won't do your best job. However, if your boss gives you the project of creating or researching anything of your choice, you may find yourself vigorously working towards a perfect outcome. Hence why student-designed projects may be more successful for students over the summer.

Lastly, every student and teacher can widen their understandings and learn something new and different through a simple student-designed project. Due to the fact that many topics are not covered in the majority of school requirements; not only the student learn something new, but the teacher as well. Therefore, the student will be exposed to more branches of knowledge and have the opportunity to share this with their teachers. For example, the student may encounter topics about what is currently going on in the world and tie it around something they've already learned. Although it isn't necessary, this will help the students understand what they already know. Then, once they can present their projects, the teacher as well will be informed of such topic, and thus, learn from their students and understand their own teaching better. Furthermore, this may even help the teachers teach certain topics with better examples and connections around the world. Although it may be a simple summer project, a teacher's understanding can be broadened through even one student's project.

In conclusion, every student's intellect and work ethic can be shown through a student-designed project, as well as the potential chances of the student and teacher broadening their knowledge and learning new topics. Students have different potential, interests, and knowledge, thus it would be a blessing for schools to switch to student-designed projects. As stated before, things that interest us are more likely to pull our full attention and energy, rather than things we view as work; especially in times like summer vacation. Unfortunately for students, many schools will continue to require teacher-designed projects and may not be changing any time soon. Although many may believe that student-designed projects are a waste of time, the essence of every student is reflected through these projects. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
B7A015945756,"Should summer projects be the students choice or the teachers choice? Even though some say that doing summer projects for school should be the teachers choice, most people believe that the over the summer projects should be the students choice because the students will have the chance to be creative and to do their own thing, students will also be able to show off the different sides of themselves that most people have not seen, and the students would also be more likely to do the project if it was on or about something that they like. Some people think that it should not be the teachers choice becuase they do not always choose things that thier students would like, most of the time the students do not normally like the topics that teachers choose.

First, letting students choose what they want the project to be on gives them a chance to be creative. Allowing students to choose what type of topic that they would want to do lets the student be independent, showing their teachers that they can handle responsibilities when it comes to taking the time to choose a topic that they would enjoy writing about. Students will most likely take this summer project and turn it into something fun instead of it being boring sumer work that they must do in order to proceed to the next grade, students will step outside of their comfort zones and show a little more creativity in their work.

Next, when allowing students to choose their own project topic they will be more likely to get their work finished instead of sitting there thinking about if they should do their work or just let it sit there. If the teachers let the students do what they enjoy doing the student will add a little twist to it and make it pop, for instance there are some students out there who really enjoy art. If teachers gave the students the option of deciding what their projects could be, I am pretty sure some of those kids who love art will add their own twist to things, like colors and anything else you could think of. If teachers allow students to choose then they would have a reason to get their work done, because thye would have choosen what they wanted to do and if that was the case the students would have had to do their work.

However, students do not really seem to like when teachers make choices on what the students can and cannot do for their projects. Students would much rather be able to choose what they can do on a project than letting the teachers choose two or three topics or things that the student can do, even when teachers decide to make things easier for the students the students always have something negative or something to disagree about when the teachers have made the choices.

In conclusion, even though some say that doing a summer project for school should be up to the teachers, most people believe that the summer project should be up to the students because it gives the students a reason to be creative and to do their own thing, showing other sides of themselves that no one has ever seen before, and if the teachers find some topic to do the students will always have their opinons on what the teacher has choosen, plus it shows them how to be independent. students should have a say in what they are able to do when it comes to projects outside of school. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
DA1AAFBF0C33,"Let me paint a picture for you. It's the last week of summer and you're already dreading going back to school. Then out of nowhere you remember that your teacher assigned a long, and boring, over the summer project that will take that entire last week to finish. This isn't fair because it takes away what little time left from your summer break. This is why I think students should design the projects because they will ensure that not all of your summer is wasted, they will make the projects less taxing on your grade, and they will make the projects more exciting for kids to do. In this writing I will explain why students should be the ones to design over the summer projects.

First of all, the school system has been slowly making summers shorter and shorter over the years so this gives students less time on break. With this less time the kids have to cram as much fun and vacation as they can before they are right back in school. Teachers give these long strenuous projects out like they are Christmas gifts. Projects like these can take up long periods of time and essentially waste time kids are supposed to have off of school. Students would cater to the precious amount of time that students are given by making the project shorter and probably a little easier. That way the kids don't come back to school sluggish and and tired because they had a unnecisarilly hard project that they were required to complete.

Most teachers advertise these projects as if they were worth most of the first quarter grade, but in actuality the projects barley count for much of a grade at all. These projects should be designed to keep the students seeking the arrival of the school year, not wanting to drop out of school. If the students were allowed to design the projects then they would be able to make the project enough to where it's not pointless, but at the same time it won't ruin your first quarter grade and punish you for not completing it. Students know what is too difficult and what could be done with no effort. So if you let the students design it then the project would meet in the middle and be made for students by students who understand them.

Although learning in the summer might help students get ready for the next school year. Most kids, like me, don't want to spend our summers crammed away trying to complete an assignment that doesn't even intrigue us. If the teachers allowed students to design the projects then they would make them based off the interests of the kids and what they like to learn about. Have you ever had a project that seemed like the teacher tried too hard to make it relevant but it really wasn't? Well the best advocates for all things relevant would be the people who are living in it. Students know what is important and interesting because it also interests them. Teachers don't really know what kids want to learn about because they are required to teach their students to pass mandatory tests. So students would be able to peak interests of their peers whilst learning.

Students should be the people to design projects because they won't waste all of your summer, they will make the projects less weighted on your first quarter grade,and they will make the projects fun and interesting. So teachers should let their students be the designers of projects because they know what kids want to learn about.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
5E460A253EA9,"Teachers are the brain of school, they know everything and most of the time have solutions for every situation. Summer projects are projects that should help the students improve on their most needed parts of a subject. But a student designing these projects may lead to failure. Teachers should be the ones who design summer projects because teachers can create projects better than students can, teachers know what student need to improve on, and some students wont finish the project before school starts. Others may say that its fun for students to create their own project and have their own spin on it. But most students wont end up turning it in before school starts.

One main way that students study is by doing projects before test and working on the topic there on. This means that teachers know how to create a project on topics that students need to work on. Teachers create projects better than students can and the ones teachers make will be better for the students. Students will either turn in lazy work that they rushed, or wont turn in at all. Students will procrastinate and once they start the project and have to start from scratch with no idea what their project needs to be about, they wont end up doing it.

Most students dont know what topics that they need improvement on. So most students will do the project on an easy topic that they are more familiar with. But the teachers know what the students need to improve on. Teachers could deign the project around what needs improving. This will help the students who are struggling on certain spots of a subject and help them master it. For example when a student creates a project, mainly one over the summer, there going to want to get it done as fast as they can and then they will create a lazy project and will not get a good grade. But if a teacher deigns it, then students will more than likely be forced to create a good project and get a good grade on it.

Procrastination is a big thing with students in high school and college. Students will procrastinate until the day before something is due. If students were the ones designing this project, they would procrastinate until the last day then not know where to even begin because they have no instructions. Students will end up proposing something bad or maybe dont even do it and start the school year off bad. But if students procrastinate until the last day and have instructions, then they will most likely end up doing it and most students will end up making a nice project.

On the other hand, Students, that are always on top of their work, will want to create their own projects. Students creating their own projects can be a learning experience if they want to become a teacher. Students will be able to put their own spin on the project. But its not all positives, other students that procrastinate a lot will have a hard time creating and starting a project. Or some students will do an easy project and then the project pretty much become useless.

In conclusion, teachers should be the ones who design summer projects because teachers can create projects better than students can, teachers know what student need to improve on, and some students wont finish the project before school starts. Most students who procrastinate wont have much of hard time if they have instructions and dont have to start from scratch. This will help students improve on what needs to be improved. Also some students might end up mastering the topics they need to improve. Others will think different and want to do the project by themselves, but thats not the best idea if they want to get a good grade.                    ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
F776F9881474,"Have you ever had to do a summer project because I have and it sucked because the project that the teacher gave me was boring but if I got to choose my summer project I would choose something that I will enjoy and be able to learn.

If students had a choice to pick a summer project or let the teacher decide I am pretty sure most if not all of the students will let them self choose. I remember when I was in like 5th or 6th grade and my teacher was like ""I know its the end of the year but you guys and girls are gonna have to do a summer project"". After she said that everyone hated her for the rest if the summer and not just because she gave us a summer project but also because it was very boring but if it was not boring then I am pretty sure everyone would not be as mad as they were.

I believe that if students got to choose the summer project then more students will get it done. I know for a fact that if I was to get a summer project it would not most likely not get done but if I had a choice to pick it or have my teacher pick it I would pick it my self any day of the week. If I would was to choose my own summer project then I am almost 100% sure most kids would like to pick their own summer project.

I am saying all of this to say I think that if schols make kids do summer projects they should be able to pick what they are going to do because it will be more fun, more kids will do it, and it gives a chance for kids to think on their own.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4

How many times have teachers assigned summer projects, yet you only get half of the students' projects? Aren't you tired of getting only half your students' projects and having to chase students down to complete their projects. When will you learn students aren't interested in teacher-assigned projects. Why not give something else a try, like student-assigned projects. Instead of teacher-assigned summer projects, why not try student-assigned summer projects. It allows to student to be creative, work independently on projects like they will in future, and get students interested in their projects. For schools to assure students continue learning effectively over the summer they should allow summer projects to be student-assigned.

Schools allowing student-assigned summer projects allows students to design and customize their own projects to their own interest. Being able to allow students to pick a topic you're passionate about gets students interested in their summer projects. Since students are allowed to pick their own topics, the project is on something that they're interested in. Students have a chance to choose a topic they have an interest for or are passionate about. Therefore, this sets students up to become immersed in their summer projects. Student-assigned summer projects allows students to explore new topics that can spike interest for students to pursue a possible, future career path.

Having projects be student assigned allows students to work independently on projects as practice and preparation for independent study projects for college. In college student-assigned projects or independent study projects are assigned often, especially in STEM fields. To help students prepare for college, student -assigned summer projects will give them a preview as to what it is like to do an independent project. Students all ready feel high schools don't prepare them for college, but student-assigned projects can get students that needed preparation for college. Schools allowing student-assigned projects are helping their students to receive necessary preparation for college.

Some educators and students believe that teacher-assigned projects are the better choice over student-assigned projects. They think it will give more structure to the project, projects will explicitly follow the curriculum, and students will know exactly what they have to complete for the project. However, all teacher-assigned projects do is stifle creativity, lose student interest, and cause students to become more dependent on teachers for ideas. For example, whenever I have teacher-assigned projects I get excited about the project, but I forget about the rubric. Once I remember there is a rubric to be followed, all of my creative ideas for the project dissipate because they don't follow the rubric guidelines. Student-assigned projects allow for more creativity, students aren't bound by a rubric.

Schools should allow student-assigned summer projects, since it allows students to open up their minds and become creative thinkers. Teacher-assigned projects stifle the creative young minds of students. Assigning independent student projects allows students to independently explore their interest, prepare them for college, and lets students use their creative brains to learn.

You run out of your classroom knowing you will you will not have to worry about a teacher's assignment for the next three months. The only assignment you have is a project that is in your complete control. Some would say a student-designed summer project will not benefit the projects educational purpose because students would pick the easiest projects but that is not the case. Students should should design there own summer projects because they can be creative and not feel the burden of a forced teacher-designed project.

If the summer project is student-designed than this will allow creativity and make the project more fun. Students can even insert their summer activities into the project. Wouldn't it be better to have a project that feels like a summer activity? Having been in the school system for about 11 years, students know that a student-designed project allows them to be more creative and to think about ways to make the project fun. Students like the idea of choosing how they work on assignments and having a project over the summer is already annoying enough. Choosing how you do the project over vacation, however, encourages creativity and motivation to actually do the project.

As teenagers, being told to wash the dishes or do the laundry makes us less motivated to do them because we do not always like being told what to do. But when we do them voluntarily, we feel encouraged to do more than if asked. Same goes with school projects. Knowing you are forced to work on a project that has all the requirements laid out can feel like a burden. The projects aspects may not be your strong suit but, if you have the project in your control than you feel more motivated to work on it. You can inset your strong ideas that you know you can work best on.

Some would say a teacher-designed summer project allows for better learning because teachers know more, but a student-designed summer project will let students not only learn more but be more creative and motivated to work. Having a required assignment over the summer is annoying enough so, letting students design their projects lifts some weight off their shoulders. Students should not have to feel the burden of a teacher-designed project over the break but rather the creativity they have on how they choose to learn.

6B34BD2CA144,"How creative can students get on a project? There are many ways students could design a project.

Many students struggle doing projects when the topic is assigned by a teacher or hate the short amount of time the project is due. Although, Teacher's prefer give their students a topic that everyone could be on because it would be easier to grade. It would be interesting if the summer project was selected by students design because students would be able to get creative, there would be plenty of time to do the project, and students could get a chance to show their work edict.

It would be better for student to come up with unique ideas for their own project and they could learn a lot with researching. Also, Teachers would get to see the different topics their students came up with instead of seeing the same ideas they gave their students. Students could amaze teachers on the ideas they came up with and how they came up with the topic they choose. Students could also tell their teacher about what they resaerch and information they found out. I'd would rather come up with an awesome idea to show my teacher than have them give me a topic that is boring.

Summer is enough time for students to plan a project. They will have time to choose a topic on what the project is going to be on and they will have time to get the materials they need. They will also have many ideas on how the project would look like. Some students struggle doing a project in a short period of time because they either can't turn it in on time or they do not know what to do the project about. But if they student picked their project design then there won't be excuses on how they did have time to do their project or why it wasn't turned in on time.

Having students pick their own designed project is a great to show their work edict. Teachers would have many ways on grading students project like how hard their student was willing to try or put in effort. They could even see how long it could have took them based on how the project looks. Whether they wanted to do it and get a good grade or not care at all what they got. Some students that don't like to do work could have a chance to show their teacher that they could actually put in some work.

Students can show teachers the awesome projects they made with the ideas they came up with. Teacher could see the many different project ideas. Most students would enjoy doing a project by their design because they could show their unique styles. Teacher sometime have uninteresting topics that they pick out for their students. But, If students was able to pick their own design for the summer project then they would have creative ideas to show, enough time to do it, and could show work edict.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
B4F7C5D9CA8D,"As the school year approaches, students begin to turn their attention towards the daunting task of summer assignments. Teachers give assignments to their future students, whether it be books to read or projects to complete. These are designed to ensure that the students don't forget everything they learned in the previous year during summer. These summer projects should be student designed because students would be more motivated, students would know what they are doing more, and teachers could get an idea of what the student is like before the school year completely starts.

It is not uncommon for students to not want to do a project that their teacher assigned them, and the fact that this project is during their precious summer break doesn't make it any better. A student might not try as hard on this assignment, or maybe even not do it, which defeats the purpose of a summer project. But if a student were to create their own assignment, that student would be much more motivated to complete the task. For example, if a teacher told their students to read a book and write a report on it, it likely wouldn't appeal to those who have to read the book. But if the student were to choose what project they wanted to do after reading the book, they could pick something they enjoy doing, and therefore the assignment would be much more productive.

Before students meet their teacher at the beginning of the year, they are left with he inability to ask questions about the projects assigned to them over summer. This means that if the teachers give vague instructions, or the a student generally doesn't understand the assigned task, they best they can do is try to email their teacher and hope for a response. But, if a student picked their own project, they would definitely pick something that they know they understand and can do. For example, if a teacher tell their students to read a book and create a diorama, the students won't know what they need to create a diorama of. Now, a student given the same book but told to pick their own project would choose an activity based on the book that they know how to do, which would allow them to better complete the assignment.

Summer projects are the first way a teacher gets to know what a student is like. If every one of the teacher's students is assigned the same exact project, they likely won't be able to tell much about the student. But, if a student is able to pick their own assignment, the teacher can begin to get an idea of how that student learns. For example, if the students are told to read a book but are allowed to choose their own projects, one student might choose to rewrite a scene of the book form a different perspective. This could tell the teacher that this student is a good reader and writer who understands the text they are given. Another student could choose to make a three dimensional model of something significant in the book, telling the teacher they are more creative and visual. This allows teachers to start to know their students.

It goes without saying that the typical student wants to eliminate summer assignments altogether to have a responsibility-free summer, but a student-designed summer assignment is the next best thing. It allows the assignment to still get done, while letting students show thier teachers what they like to do, along with keeping them motivated and understanding the project.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
C85BA77FBF86,"Should students create their own summer project or should teachers create the project ? one agrees with teachers creating the project by assigning each individual student to a project that best fits them and see which spot they have most difficulty in and have them do a project on that one so that way they can eventually master that subject. Another reason is because students often like to take the easy way out so they would pick the project that would seem very easy and that would prove that they actually understand if they do it on something that is fairly simply and easy. Also think its a great opportunity to get students on the right track for college because sometimes college professors give you projects over break and it is due when you return .

The teachers creating the project sounds like the more responsible idea because when in school students tend to try and take the easy way out and give there self a very simple project which wouldn't really show that they actually learned anything however, it will just show that they are capable of doing a task that isn't hard to do . From my personal experience a few years ago my teacher Mrs. Generic_Name told our class we were allowed to choose any project we wanted using the scientific method so i decided it was a great idea to do a tornado i put two soda bottles together duck tap it and put water inside so when you shake it up it creates something that looks like a tornado. Now that i look back at it i realize that wasnt a create project to do because it didnt really take any hard work or effort ; my teacher graded it and she wrote a note which she said "" Please put forth or effort"" i received a c on the project. This is why i think teachers should assign the project so the students that would take the easy way out wouldnt set their self up for failure.

One believes if the teacher assigning each individual student to a project that best fits them and see which spot they have most difficulty in and have them do a project on that specific one it can help students become better with school and pass more classes. A prime example would be if a student was having trouble learning about the great depression the teacher would create a project on that specific subject and basically allow the student to do research, take notes, and a summary in his/she own words and also create a ten question quiz for a student to take. Therefore when they return to school it will be the first project grade in the grade book so that way the students wouldnt think they have done it for no reason.

Teachers designing students summer projects will prepare them for college, Its a great opportunity to get students on the right track for college because sometimes college professors give you projects over break and it is due when you return . A personal experience for me is when my older sister Generic_Name had a project from her sociology class and it was due the third day back to class i asked her "" Why do you have work its summer"" and she replied "" college is why different from grade school , we even have projects on winter break"". Thats when i then realized college is a lot of work and one should prepare their selves for. Which is why i chose the teachers to create the project because it will help the students out on the long run.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
293C1D45E66B,"During the summer, students get do to do as they please so it would only be fair for the students to design their own project. Students should be able to design their own summer projects for a number of reasons. By doing so, us as the students will be able to express our own creativity. It would give us more motivation to get it done, as well as how the teachers knowing what the kids are feeling.

Students would be able to express their own creativity by doing whatever they want for the project. As a student myself, I always get really excited when teachers let the kids pick what they want to do for projects because it is like a sense of freedom and a sign of maturity. When I was little, one of my teachers gave us a project where we had to give a presentation about what our favorite animal was. It felt great that we didnt have to to a presentation about a animal that the teacher would give us because what if it wasnt our favorite animal? Why should we have to do a project about a animal that we arent interested in? But by the teacher letting us chose, I was able to have fun doing the project and I got an outstanding grade on it.

Next. A student designed project will also make kids want to do it. Nobody wants to do a boring project that is going to take forever over summer break. If the students got to decide on what to do, we would have way more fun with it because it will make us want to do it, and also because it lets us express ourselves. Although it would be nice for the students to pick the project, there are also downsides. One of the downsides will be that not everyone will do the project because they either dont know what to do for the project or they are just lazy. Also during the summer people are traveling a lot so some kids cant complete the project, weather its because they just dont want to or they cant because of their location.

Lastly giving us the option to do this will make the students learning more fun. It would make it more fun because the teachers are giving the students a opportunity to speak themselves and giving us a voice. If all we did was do what the teachers wanted us to do, it wouldnt be fair because we are doing stuff that they think is good for us when the good thing really is when the students get to pick projects. Not only is letting us pick the projects good for us, but it is also a learning experience for the teachers as well. I say that because if we pick the projects, the teacher is going to learn how kids/teenagers think, and will start changing things up so that we can all express different things in the classroom.

Overall, If we let the kids chose projects over the summer it will be a learning experience for everyone. The teachers will really get to know how the students are really feeling, and they can take that information and try to teach the kids in a different way during the school year. And it will be good for the students because we are also learning about ourselves as a person. Teenagers are really complicated because they have so many emotions and you just cant tell how we are feeling all the time. But I am positive that if we got to design our own project, it would make us feel more like adults and treated with respect.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
714C2CC7885E,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assume they continue learning during their break. During summer break most students will not do work unless assigned work to do. Summer projects can help students remember what they learned in school. A summer project can be beneficial to a teacher and to the students. Opponents wrongly believe summer projects should be student designed because students are more likely to do it and can be creative. Although some believe summer projects need to be student designed it should be known, summer projects must be teacher designed.

Summer projects should be teacher designed because of benefits to the teacher. Summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers can plan ahead. For example, Mr. Generic_Name planned a summer project before school started. If Mr. Generic_Name plans ahead then he would not have to worry about it later in the school year. Summer projects should be teacher designed because it is easier for teachers to grade. For instance, Mr. Generic_Name designed the project so he will know what to look for. It will be easier to grade since he designed thew project and made the rubric. Summer projects should be teacher designed because the teacher will not have to worry about the students doing the wrong things. For example, Mr. Generic_Name will not have to worry about the students designing a inappropriate project or not doing the project at all if he does it himself.

Summer projects should be teacher designed because of benefits to students. Summer projects should be teacher designed so students will not have to worry about designing and doing the project. For instance, Generic_Name will not have to design and do the project. Since the teacher is designing the project Generic_Name will not have to worry about that. She can focus on just doing the project. Summer projects should be teacher designed because students know what teachers are looking for. For instance, the students has had many projects before in Mr. Generic_Name's class. Since the teacher is designing the project the students know what he is looking for. Summer projects should be teacher designed so that the students can get the project done faster. For example, Since Mr. Generic_Name already designed the project all Generic_Name has to do is do the project which saves her a lot of time. Doing just the project is faster than having to design it and do the project.

Even though some believe summer projects must be student designed it should be known, summer projects need to be teacher designed. The opposition incorrectly believes summer projects should be student designed because students will learn work ethic and possibly find hidden talents. Summer projects should be teacher designed because of benefits to teachers such as planning ahead, projects being easier to grade, and not having to worry about students doing the wrong things. Additionally, summer projects should be teacher designed because of benefits to students such as not having to worry about designing and doing the project, students already know what the teachers looking for in a project, and getting the project done faster. Summer projects help students remember information. When it is time to go back to school teachers will not have to reteach because the students did a summer project.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
6703193EBE49,"Many people argue whether or not summer projects should be designed by students or by teachers. These summer projects would help the students continue learning while on break. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because they would challenge the students, teachers have a better understanding of the information, and the projects would prepare students for the school year.

The first reason why summer projects should be teacher-desinged is because they would better challenge the students. Challenging projects cause students to learn the information better. Students must think outside the box in order to actually learn something. A challenging project is one that causes students to have to conduct research, and if the students research for their projects then they would higher chance of remembering the information. If the projects were student-designed then the students would take the easy way out and make the projects easier, which does not help the students grow in any way. Easy projects would cause the students to take less time on it and forget the information faster. Teachers would not only make the projects more challening, but also more reliable.

The second reason why projects should be teacher-designed is because teachers have a better understanding of the information. Students haven't learned the information yet, so the projects that are student-designed would be less reliable than the teacher-designed projects. The teachers know the information because they teach it every year, so the projects would be thorough. If the students designed a project with out completely knowing the information then they could be setting other students up for failure. Teachers have a syllibus to work off of and students do not, so if the students designed the projects they could hurt and not help. The teacher-designed projects would be more helpful for students because teachers better understand the information, and the projects would give students insight on the following year.

The last reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because they would prepare students for the upcoming year. Teachers have the whole year planned out before the start of school, especially returning teachers. Because they have the year planned, they know exactly what information is on the syllibus. The projects the teachers would design would be better than the ones student-designed because they would be planned according to what will be taught during the school year. This would help the students get an idea of what the year would be like and have a better understanding of the information before the start of school.

Many people disagree on whether summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. The projects, designed by either students or teachers, would continue the education of students through the break regardless of who creates them. Student-designed projects would help students learn because people their own age understand their learning techniques better than teachers; however, summer projects should be teacher-designed. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they would better challenge the students, the teachers know the information better, and the projects would give the students an idea of what the school year would be like.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
09ABE1DE8537,"The summer projects should be teacher-designed. Due to the fact that if it is student- designed, students would take advantage and make it too easy. So in elementary school a teacher said to make our own projects during the summer, so some of the kids decided to do a project about books, so those kids did a summary about a book for babies. Those kids did a summary about the cat in the hat. Therefore, the kids passed without learning anything, because it was too easy. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed.

Sometimes students might make it too easy. The students designed their own projects. The projects were about reading any book they wanted. Most of them picked kids books. So on the first day of school they all got good grades for doing preschool work. Due to that the kids didn't learn a single thing all summer. Some teachers believe that the key to success is hard work. So thats why some teachers will make students do summer projects hard so the student can retain and gain more knowledge. In elementary school there was a teacher that during any break we had like winter break, spring break, and summer break, she would give us a very hard project and every time she would give us the project she would say, "" I am making you all do this work because i want all of you to be successful.""

Students are willing to take advantage of easy work. Teachers just want their students to grow up and be successful.

Some people would say, "" What if the students decide to make the work harder."" Most teachers give students summer projects to keep the students mind strong. Junior is in high school and he decides to make his project hard so then he can learn more information. Sometimes a person doesn't need to work harder when they can work smarter. Generic_Name was trying to work on a packet his teacher gave him for summer but it was too much, so he asked his friend to come over so they can work together. If a student decides to make his project harder, then they will have more of a challenge. Some students begin to forget everything they learned at school so the projects are to keep their mind strong and educated.

Well if the student makes the project too hard, then they won't be able to enjoy their summer break. The summer projects are pointless, because they are going to relearn everything in the beginning of the new school year. Generic_Name decided to make his project as hard as possible and due to him doing that it took him all summer to finish it. so during the end of the school year, my class was learning complex math equations, but then towards the beginning of the new school year we began to learn about complex math equations.

Summer projects shouldn't be student-designed, but instead teacher-designed. Back in elementary school kids used to take advantage of student-designed projects. Teacher-designed projects aren't too easy but also aren't too hard.         ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
55F5CBF45A7F,"Have you ever been given a really boring project that had a ton of requirements and restrictions on it? How were you able to do your best when most of your creative freedom was taken away? The truth is, is that those grueling projects limit you. Limitation on projects gets in the way of obtaining valuable knowledge and reaching your full potential. Teachers should allow students to create their own projects. Letting students design their projects will ensure students receive a better understanding of material, are more involved with their work, and will make them more willing to finish their work.

As a fellow student myself, I have done many summer assignments designed by teachers and summer assignments designed by myself. For my own project, I chose something that interested me and even though it was over three years ago, I still remember the results I got and what I had learned from that project, Did you know tomato plants grow better with green tea than water because I did, after my project. On the other hand I had recently had a summer project that had me do a bunch of unnecessary information searching on the web, even though it was so recent I honestly couldn't tell you one thing I learn from it. I dont even remember what it was about. Having created my own project, with a topic that interested me, made my learning experience far superior than that of a project designed by a teacher. Not only was I able to obtain knowledge that my teacher intended for me to have but I also had a fun time doing so because I wanted to know more about my topic of interest. I also wanted to finish my project and make it turn out really nice since I had a sense of pride knowing I created this project.

Greater involvement in a project tends to create better results. Having students be more involved with their projects is beneficial not only to students but teachers as well. For students it encourages them to be creative and enables them to have more freedom to do what they want with their project, I mean isn't it fair? Their the ones working on their break. Giving them creative freedom is a small but generous favor that will innate better work. For example if a teacher were to design the project it would have a lot of unnecessary requirements and restrictions that limit their students from reaching their full potential causing students to get more upset about the project and less willing to put in the work for it. Teachers benefit in the way that they know their students will try to learn and discover something knew in these projects and that they aren't just wasting their time. Teacher designed projects tend to makes projects similar to everyone else's project as well as less interesting to work on.

Picking a topic that is interesting for all students has always been a teachers downfall, but not anymore, leave that problem up to the students. Sometimes the best way to solve a problem is leaving it to someone else. Picking a topic that interest you not only makes you want to put in the work but it makes you want to finish it and look at the final product. Its common knowledge that if people are more interested in something they are more liking going to want to get more involved with it. Teachers often face many unnecessary problems like weather or not they will complete it, if they followed all the rules, and weather or not they learned something from it. Theres just as many problems on the student side like stress, unwillingness to do, and lack of purpose found in doing all that work. The answer to all those problems is simple; let students design their projects the way they want to. Some people may argue students will make their project super simple so they don't have to do that much work, but even if the project is simple that student might still learn something from it, and its better than receiving no project at all.

Teachers whole purpose for these projects are to get their students to learn yet they make it so much more difficult for them to retain the knowledge. Students are force to give up valuable time to work on a project that they gain nothing from instead of making it worth their time by letting them design it themselves. Student designed projects make Students more proud of their work since it is their own ideas going into it and solve a lot of problems for teachers and students. Take off the limitation and allow students the freedom to create their own projects, projects are like art and should be encouraging the students to get involved and try their best. When teachers design them students do the work for a grade not for the discovery of more knowledge; which shouldn't be a projects purpose. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
6ACDC003F40F,"Student designed projects, in my opinion, are the most effective and engaging summer projects for students. They make it possible to keep students intersted and engaged in the class during the summer, and give students more creative freedom as they work.

I find it to be the case with almost every student I know that they are caught in the situation that on the first day of school when a teacher goes over what they learned last year they struggle to remember even the basics the material. One of the biggest problems with students today is that they lose intrest in the subject matter over the summer, and as a result don't retain a lot of the imformation that they had learned throughout the previous school year. a student designed project can help aleviate some of these problems by allowing students to work on a subject matter that potentially intrests them more than one chosen for them. Personally when I am allowed to choose my subject matter for a project I need to work on I find myself much more motivated to complete it than with teacher designed projects.

Some may say that a teacher designed project is better because it is a more structured assignment that has a more predictable end result, but I believe that a more structured assignment is not necesarily a good thing. While a structured assignment does have its benefits a more open ended project allows students to work more creatively within the peramiters provided, and ensures that the end result better reflects the time and effort put forth by the student. Another important benefit provided by open ended projects is that it makes it harder to cheat or plagarize from other students. If every student is given the task of completing the exact same project it makes it very easy to take the work of another student and slightly edit it for thier own project. This problem is largely elliminated with student designed projects because no two students will be doing the same exact project, and everyones projects will be unique to them.

I personally have a lot of trouble actively involving myself in projects and activities, in school, when I don't have the freedom to choose what I'm working on and how I am allowed work on it, and I know that many students have the same problems I do. When a student is allowed to decide what they work on it improves the end product because a student will naturally work harder on something they enjoy or are interested in. Unfortunately an open ended project will allow some students to take the easiest possible route and create an underwhelming product, But a techer designed project with a more rigid structure wouldn't change that. Students who have no intrest in the class or project will look for the easiest solution that requires the least ammount of effort no matter what kind of project they are given. Teacher designed projects only get rid of any chance of engaging students that would otherwise be disintrested.

When students are allowed to design their summer projects themselves it makes it possible to achieve a enthusiasm and intrest for the subject matter that would be hard to produce otherwise. The ability to choose a topic that a student may find interesting helps to solve the issue of lack of mativation that many students, like myself, have problems with. Schools and teachers should work to integrate more of these types of projects into there classes in order to better engage thier students.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
B608721A4DF0,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning their break. If students were to design thier own summer project they would do it on somwthing they like instead of doing it on something educational. If teachers were to create the idea of the summer it would be about something productive and educational. The opposition wrongly think that summer projects must be student designed because they can learn planning skills and students will feel satisfied. Although some believe that summer project need to be designed by students, it should be known that teachers should desgin the summer projects because of the benefits for later and the benefits the students can get now.

First, summer projects should be teacher designed because of the benefits the students can get for the future. One of my reasons is, students will learn something new since teachers created the idea for the summer project. This relates to my topric because if someone were learn something new. What ever that person is trying learn about, the project could help him with what ever he is doing. If he gets a project about pollution and how it affects the enviroment and he wants a career about saving the ecosystem. The project would help him by showing and telling him ways he can start helping the ecosystem now. Another reason is that students will learn time management. Time management is great a great thing to have because if a person can manage their time to any degree would be splended because they would be able to get all of their assignments done on time. If all of this girls' teachers gave her a due date for her project she would get it done on time because she has good timemanagement for her age. She would get her project done a few days early and then turn it in when she done so she does not forget about the project. Having time management is good because like the girl that was brought up earlier finished her project early so she might get extra credit for tuning it in before the due date.

Secoondly, a teacher designed summer project would be good because of the benefits the students cna get now. The first rason is that students will not be stressing out so much as they if they had to come up with the idea for their summer project. This relates to my topic because the less someone stresses the more that person can get done. There was this student who had a teacher that made him create an idead for his summer project he did not know hat to do for the project so he did not do it because it was stressin him out. Another student was given a summer project he same time as the student that was brought up but this time this student did his because he knew what to do for the project because the teacher crated the idea. The first student was stressing out because he wante dit to be school approiate but he wanted it to be about something he liked to do. He did not do it in the end because it was too stressful. The last reason is that students will have more time to finish their project and it gives them more free time to do what they want over summer. The students will have more time to finish their project because they do not have to sit and brainstorm on what to do or how to do their project. Since the they have more time to do their project becaus etheir teacher told what to do for it they cans pend more time doing their project. They would have more time because the idea of the project was planned by the teacher already.

Many may think students must create a design for the summer project, it should be understood that teachers should be the ones designing the summer projects. The other side incorrectly thinks that students need to design their own projects because it helps them with confidence in themselves and it will be satisfying because they finished something they created by themselves. However, summer projects should be teacher designed because of the benefits for later such as learning soemthing new and learning time management. Also teachers should design the summer projects of the benefits students can get now like less stress and the ability to have more time on their project. If this summer project thing were to ever happen I would like the teacher to create the idea for it instead of me beacuse i'm just really bad with comming up with ideas.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
290021A1D937,"A great man once said , "" Let your child go at their own pace and you will learn that they know more than you anticipated."" Scientist proved over 70% of students learn better when they have control over what they learn and how they learn it. Many schools require kids to complete projects over summer break so they can continue to obtain knowledge while on break. Many people believe that teachers should design their students projects because kids or teenagers would forget the lesson however, this is not true. Although some may disagree, students should be able to create their own projects.

There are a variety of reasons students should design their own projects, such as they will be more prideful in the work they accomplish. When students become more prideful in their work it encourages them to believe in their selves. When the students become prideful they obtain the knowledge better. Another reason is that students will learn to be creative. Most teachers do not understand there are many ways to teach a classroom of children. When following a teachers instruction for 10 months kids and teenagers tend to lose their creativity.

Following behind getting pride and being creative, in the work force many jobs require people to do their own projects. If students have to follow a teachers instructions they will learn to seek validation or piggy back off of someone else performance. With this experience students will learn to be confident in their work as long as they understand what they are doing. Also, if students are told how to do things all the time their brain wont develop as well as they are supposed to. In school kids are taught to think for their selves yet, they always have to follow a lesson plan and do as the teachers says otherwise it would be wrong. That does not help them learn from their mistakes nor let them express what they know.

In conclusion, students should form and structure their own projects so they have a better understanding. Many children learn differently and this could be expressed in their work. In these years of adolescence there is a lot of things that impacts them. If they have no confidence in their work they will feel ashamed of anything they do. If they arent creative they wont learn how to express themselves in their writing form or in any form of that matter. If they stick to one way of learning theyll be stuck in the mindset that they are dumb if they dont get it one way. Although many may feel that summer projects should be formed by teachers so they could have better instruction, this is not true. Ultimately, schools should let their kids design their own projects and et them do it with pride. Many will be amazed by the accuracy, connection, and brain power kids and teenagers have within them.        ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
CB00405C862D,"The idea of projects over the summer should be controlled by the student body as it will allow a deeper engagement and that it would encourage a student's work habits. Students will gain a greater knowledge through student-designed projects because they are likely to pick projects that is in their interests. Doing projects of interest will not only provide students to be engaging, but can actually be fun to the student body. Although teacher-designed projects can ensure students will get a learning out of projects, student-designed can allow students to pick projects of interest which allows more engagement and can be a fun activity to look forward to during the summer.

Summer projects that are student-designed allows students to choose projects of interests which causes them to be more engaging. Allowing students the opportunity to pick their own project causes students to be more interactive as they are completing a project that interests them. A majority students that get projects during the school year don't get any benefit from the experience because they are not given an assignment that is enjoyable. If students were to be given an assignment that is not enjoyable, they won't be committed to put in a lot of effort when completing the project. Also, students that don't put in effort toward the project are less likely to even get a full learning experience which defies the point of learning during the break. Not only will students be more committed to do projects, but they can also get an actual educational experience throughout the summer. The idea of having teacher-designed projects is basically having summer school, while student-designed projects can allow students to be more free and outgoing.

In addition to making students more engaged, student-designed projects can be considered to be a fun activity to do during the summer. Having student-designed projects during the summer can be thought of as a fun hobby to most students because the projects can literally be about anything they can imagine. Student-designed projects can allow a student to have a creative and critical mindset which allows a more fun experience than having teacher-designed projects that can be strict and overwhelming. There is moments during teacher-designed projects that can cause a student to be frustrated because the teacher has full control of the task to complete. However, there are some setbacks to having student-designed, such as student projects that are not even considered to be educational. With students having the power to do whatever they want on a project, students will sometimes have the urge to do easy assignment due their is no kind of limit of what they have to accomplish. At least with teacher-designed projects there is a criteria that a student must meet in order for them to complete the project, and with a student having the complete control of the criteria they might not get any benefits.

In conclusion, having student-designed projects over the summer will exceed a greater learning experience than teacher-designed. The intended goal of having summer projects was to continue a student's learning during their break and having student-designed projects will be the best option for a student's learning. Student-designed projects can make students think outside the box and can bring out the creative mind of a student. This will allow a far better option for the students as it can be fun and educational. Even though teacher-designed projects may ensure students will get a learning experience, student-design will make students more interactive and enjoy the task of projects.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
45EF6A4EDB1A,"Summer projects are no fun, but they are a great way for students to be engaged in their studies over the long summer break. In my experience, whenever I had summer projects given to me by a teacher, I did better in the class because on the first day of school I already had some knowledge of the topic.

I think summer projects should be teacher designed because it will make it easier on their students, and help them learn about a new topic they never researched before.

Students are busy in the Summer, witch is why a teacher- designed projects are better for them. It may be summer break, but most students get jobs or go on vacation with their family, this is where a teacher designed project is better. If all the Student has to do is follow the teachers outline instead of coming up with ways to make a unique project on a topic they have never learned of before. The ideal summer project is also not one that is supposed to be tedious, but one that will help student gain the basic knowledge needed for the class. Not a super stressful project that is left for the students to do with no outline or help from the teacher. I think because this is the first time the students are learning about this topic it is better if the teacher makes a template for the students to follow so they do the correct research. It will also take the stress of their chest so they can enjoy a nice summer break but learn at the same time.

Researching a topic you never learned of before is a hard task, especially in the summer witch is why summer projects should be teacher- designed. When learning about a new subject it is better if someone is there to help you, instead of jumping into a project. Then you have to do a lot more research and it may not all be correct, and you wont be able to tell because this is your first time learning about the topic. If a teacher was there help guide you through the project it will make the research easier and more reliable. Another benefit is that Students will focus more on the learning part of the project more because they dont have to make their own with the little to no information they know about the topic. I feel the like a whole student- designed project is too stressful for them to do in the summer, because they lack the knowledge and discipline, so if it was teacher orientated it is a guarantee that the students will learn the correct criteria. A teacher- designed project is more beneficial to the kids rather than a student- designed.

Not everyone agrees with me, some people will say that a student designed project is more beneficial for the kids. They will argue, and say its summer the students should do their own project and do it in their own time. That wouldnt work because they dont know anything about the topic, and they will procrastinate and do it the last week of the summer making it rushed and it wont be beneficial to them at all. They might also argue that students dont want to be pestered about how teacher want the work to be and it is a time for a little freedom and they can do a fun project that they deigned all by them self. Pushing creativity is good for students, but in I feel like a summer project is something you do so you can have knowledge of the topic when school starts, instead of something fun youll forget about in a week or two. There are arguments for student based projects but in the end my opinion will still stand that a teacher- designed project is more beneficial for the students.

I feel like teacher- designed projects are the best for students for two reasons, It will make it easier on the students to learn about a new topic they never learned of before, and its easier for them in the summer. Some may feel that this isnt best and a student- designed project is more beneficial, but in the end my opinion will remain the same and that is, that teacher-designed projects are the way to go. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
F239C36AE2AB,"Summer projects are a great way to keep your brain fresh during that long period off of school. Some schools require it while others do not. It is called summer break for a reason, it is supposed to be a student's time off, away from school and the rigorous learning schedule. But, some teachers give students difficult, tedious summer projects. How can a student enjoy their summer break when they have to think about the 1000 word book report their teacher assigned them over the summer? It is cruel and unfair, students should be allowed to design their own summer projects. They should have fun with it and want to look forward to completing it over the summer. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will make the project more interesting, It will give the students more motivation to complete, and it will not be as challenging for students.

While a student-designed project may be more fun or relaxed it is not beneficial to their learning. Many experts believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed. The objective of a summer project is to keep the students brain fresh and continue their learning during summer break. A teacher has all the right tools and knows what is best for a student. A teacher-designed project will be beneficial for students and actually challenge them. Students receive 3 months out of school, the least they can do is one project. Teacher-designed projects give the students more initiative and responsibility, benefiting the students.

Having the freedom to design their own project, students can make it about whatever they want and do whatever they want within the guidelines. Student can make their projects more appealing to them, and make it so they look forward to completing them. When students are choosing their topic they can choose whatever they like the most and whatever they have the most knowledge about, making the project easier for them. The best part about a student-designer project is they will be able to enjoy doing their project and have fun as well. When learning is fun it is easier to complete, It wont even feel like they are doing a tedious summer project, more like a fun experiment. This will motivate them to complete their project.

Since students are designing their own projects they will be more motivated to complete it. If they are designing it themselves they are not going to choose something that they dont like or a topic that will bore them. They are making a project that they want to do and will have fun doing it. Most teachers put summer projects in next years grade book or add it as extra credit, that just provides more incentive and motivation for the students to complete their projects to the best of their ability. Since students are designing their own project they won't be discouraged by a hard assignment assigned by their teacher, instead, they will look forward to a fun easier project that they came up with and created themselves.

It is called summer break for a reason. A break off school, a break from the tedious, rigorous schedule everyday, a break from tests and quizzes. If a teacher assigns a hard summer project that only adds on to school, it doesn't give you a break. When students design their own projects they are giving themselves a more relaxed, fun, and easier project. Something that they look forward to doing. Students don't look forward to completing a reading assignment or book report, that takes away from their summer. Summer is supposed to be relaxed and the best time of a student's life. They are supposed to be making lifetime memories, not worry about a book report. So when students are designing their own projects they take all this in to create a fun project that wont be so challenging where they can enjoy their summer. They choose a project that they will enjoy doing and something that they already have prior knowledge in to make it easier. Some students may choose to do a project about something they have no clue about because they love to learn new things. A student designed project will be much easier for students and wont be as stressful.

In Conclusion student-designed projects are more effective and beneficial. Students can choose their own topic making their projects more interesting and fun for them. Students wont be discouraged by hard, challenging projects assigned by their teachers, instead, they will be more motivated to do their project because it is on something that they designed for themselves. Summer break is supposed to be a time off for students, a time where they can relax with no stress. But, when teachers assign challenging summer projects it takes away the fun from summer, it causes stress and anxiety. Student-designed projects let students have a fun, relaxing summer while learning! Students design their projects to be fun and something that they like, it doesn't cause stress and it is easier for the student. All students in Generic_School should write an email or go talk to their teachers to let them design their own project this summer! Enough with the reading assignments and book reports, students should be able to design their own fun, educational project to complete this summer! All students should take advantage of this and voice it to their teacher!",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
5B4AE145379C,"Summer is an important time of the year for students; it is an good time for rest, but it is also an good time for further education. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue their learning during their break. These projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed because, by designing their own projects, students can learn more about what interests them, express themselves creatively, and gain more responsibility.

However, some people who disagree with this point of view may say that teacher-designed projects can be designed to fit into the next school-year's curriculum allowing students to prepare for their next year of learning. For example, if environmental health is a significant theme in the 10th grade science curriculum, teachers can design summer projects for rising 10th graders about the environment so they get a head-start in understanding the subject. While this argument may be true, specific, teacher-designed projects take away the many positive effects of student-designed projects, including the ability to learn more about personal interests.

Student-designed summer projects allow students to learn more about the interests they have. For example, if a student is very interested in government, he or she can complete a summer project about the two-party system in the United States, the bicameral system in Congress, or even the differences between government at the federal and state levels. Discovering more about personal interests is essential to students. By finding out more about what they like, students have many more opportunities in front of them. Personal interests lead to college and career interests, which lead to structure in adult life.

Students can express themselves and use creativity when designing their own projects. For example, if students are allowed to decide how they present their projects, they can express themselves through drawing, painting, photography, or even web-design. If students can express themselves creatively, they can free their minds, decrease stress, and become further engaged in their learning. Teacher-designed projects would destroy this creativity, and students would be stuck in a non-creative box. If this were the case, students would become bored, and the negatives would far outweigh the positives.

Student-designed projects give students more responsibility. For example, if a student was assigned a teacher-designed summer project, he or she would only be responsible for completing the project; but if he or she was told to design and complete a project, he or she would have to research possible topics, search for relevant information, find ways to present it, create a plan, and execute the plan. This shows that students have significantly more responsibility when designing projects themselves. This responsibility will train students and teach them how to work independently, which is an essential life skill. If students completed a teacher-designed summer project, they would not learn this skill as well as they would when designing a project on their own.

Simply stated, teacher-designed summer projects do not provide the many benefits of independent summer projects students design on their own. If a student was assigned a teacher-made project, he or she would miss out on personal interest discovery, creativity, and responsibility. More schools should replace teacher-designed summer projects with student-designed projects.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
C1F190E125B7,"While some students despise the thought of a summer assignment, others can see it as an opportunity to learn or experience new things. However, there is always one feeling towards assignments such as those, that feeling being ""

I really don't want to waste my summer on school work.

"" Moreover, since its a summer assignment, many times, a student's work ethic and motivation just might not be as clear and strong as it was during the school year. However, all of this can be remedied if the project wasn't as focused on a teacher-designed assignment; instead, more as a student-oriented one. If the student were left to their own ambitions, he or she will not only be more passionate about their topic, but will have a stronger motivation and can learn more because of their experiences.

If the student is passionate about their work and research, their product will most likely turn out better than if the teacher assigned them a specific topic. This stems from their work ethic and motivation. Keep in mind that this assignment must be completed over the summer, where students typically would rather have a break from school work than to complete it. If the assignment was about something the student likes, he or she would most likely be more passionate and do their work.

However most of the time when a student does not like the topic they were assigned, the students would rather work on it to get it finished than to take the time and actually learn from their project. While one can argue that it would be easier for the teacher to give every student the same project topic since every project would be consistent and easier to grade, others say that the teacher can simply make a standard rubric where any topic could possibly fit the criteria.

Moreover on work ethic, if the student were able to choose their own topic, their work ethic and motivation would be stronger and more defined than if they were forced a subject. Like stated in the paragraph above, if a student got to work on an assignment they were passionate about, then their work ethic would be better than if they were not passionate about their assignment. If the student was not passionate then their only motivation would be to finish the assignment, not to explore their interests. The motive relies on how passionate the student is about their topic; and if he or she is interested in what they are writing about, then it is most likely they will create a better product in general and also have a fun time learning about it. This same concept applies to more than just school and can apply to many other subjects such as, for example, a job. While many people would rather work in a job that made them happy, a lot of them work in places that employees might not necessarily enjoy. As a result, their passion and motivation for their work goes down, which eventually leads to a lower work ethic which then results in a bad product. They would rather just work on it to get it done instead of actually enjoying their work and being passionate about the subject. In the end, it is better if the student were assigned a project where they were free to investigate their own topic and create a project based on that.

Furthermore on the topic of learning, if the project was student-designed, the student will essentially learn more because of their experiences in researching. The saying ""

mistakes are the best teacher

"" rings true in this scenario, where the students are essentially learning from their experiences. Instead of giving the students a list of what to do or what type of research question to answer, if the assignment leaves that to the students, then they are essentially forced to learn researching skills and techniques. The student will be left to do their own research and deem which sources are reliable, which is teaching them more than if the teacher assigned them a specific database to use or where to find the information. These experiences will only help the student with important life skills such as investigating and researching. They can also help prepare them for the future such as college or even straight into the workplace. One can argue that having the teacher force them an assignment is teaching the students work with something they don't enjoy. While that may be true, the purpose of the assignment is to inspire the students to learn and if the students don't enjoy the topic they were assigned, it defeats the entire purpose of the assignment since it discourages them from learning more over the summer.

When it comes to a summer assignment and having students complete a project, leaving them to their own ambitions is the best idea since it helps everyone all around. Not to say that having the teacher design the project is the worst option, but considering that their purpose is to help students learn, leaving them to their own design would be more beneficial. Depending on which subject, may it be English or science, it encourages students to dive deeper into specific subject areas such as writing a book report for an English assignment or researching forensic science for a science project. All around, having students design their own project is the best way since it helps both the student and the teacher, where the student can have fun learning about the subject and the teacher not having to waste their own resources on a project. In conclusion, a student-designed project is more beneficial since it not only leaves the student to create a more passionate product, but also gives the student more motivation and encourages the student to learn more about their project.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
D4E417EF62AD,"As I heard my score on the first quiz I took in my AP US History class, I remember the happiness I felt and how grateful I was to have had such a beneficial and informative reading project over the summer. Without my teacher's aid to learn the information, I would have not understood the material as clearly as I did and achieve an above average score on the first quiz. Although some may believe otherwise, summer projects assuring continued learning during break should be teacher designed because the teacher knows what material the student needs to understand to succeed and because students may not challenge themselves as much as they need to gain any new knowledge.

Teacher designed projects make it easier for students to know what information is necessary for the course, and allow them to be more successful when it comes to assessments. For example, my AP US History teacher Dr. Generic_Name gave all of his students a reading guide and textbook to learn about the course over the summer. While doing the packet he gave his students, we all attained so much information, which heavily benefited the students when we started doing our daily quizzes. Through his reading guides, I learned how to properly take notes on the information so I could succeed when taking quizzes or tests, and I can still use what I learned to prepare for his assignments every day. Another example is my World History 1 teacher, Mrs. Generic_Name, who would have us complete small projects before every test to make sure we could comprehend and apply the material we were learning. Before each test, she would host review sessions after school where we could work on our small projects and receive help. Her teacher designed projects allowed us to succeed and made her a reliable and helpful teacher.

Summer projects designed by teachers also combat student laziness for those who do not want to challenge themselves to learn anything new on their own. For example, the summer before sophomore year, all the students in my English class were assigned a project where they had to read a book and had to complete an assignment of their choice, which could have been designing artwork, writing a review, and several other options. While this project did benefit many of the students who completed the project correctly, some students decided to choose an assignment for a book they had already read, and did not learn anything new from the experience. If the teacher had been less lenient about the project and required students to read a certain book, more students would have challenged themselves and learned something beneficial for the course. Another example is my friend Generic_Name, she had a student designed project over the summer for her Pre-calculus class, and she thought that she did not need to make a challenging project because she knew that she would learn the material when the class actually started. However, when she got to the class she realized that the teacher skipped over that material because they were supposed to have learned it over the summer. If her teacher had designed the project, she would have understood what she was supposed to learn, and made sure she was prepared for the first day of class.

Some may disagree that teachers should design summer projects because they believe students should seek out information on their own and should not just be given answers to help them in the class. However, this reasoning is flawed due to the fact that students who receive teacher aid, like reading and study guides, when learning the material tend to have more success on assessments, and form better relationships with the teacher. For example, my friend Generic_Name had a student designed project for her French class over the summer. While doing the project, she was often confused about the requirements and what she was supposed to be learning, and when she was finally in the class once the school year started, she realized she had done most of the project in a way different than what was supposed to be done. Not only did she receive a poor grade on the project, she had a negative first encounter with her teacher, which made her afraid to talk to her and get help for things in the future. Others may also disagree that teachers should not design summer projects because it limits student creativity, and prevents them from enjoying learning about things that interest them. While teacher designed projects may not seem as enjoyable to ones students design on their own, teacher deigned projects are more reliable for allowing students to learn as much as they can, and will prevent students from just relearning something or ignoring important details about a course. As another example, in my Biology class we had to do an independent research project on a topic of our choice. However, one of the people in my class decided to submit an old project one of their siblings had done to avoid doing any work. The student was caught and given a zero on the project, but if the teacher had given specific topics and made more requirements to prevent cheating, the student probably would have done the research like they were supposed to, and learn a lot of new information which would help them in the course as well.

In the past, students who were allowed to design their own projects led to misinformation and confusion about the class they were taking. This then led to lower than average grades and strain between students and their teachers. Presently, students receive a mix of student and teacher designed projects, but teacher designed projects have shown repeatedly to be more successful in student understanding of the material and are more efficient at providing guidelines for students to meet the standards required of them. In the future, teachers should give more projects they have designed so students have the capability to understand what is expected of them and are aware of how to be successful in their classes.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
DA0FBE6F11C9,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. The projects assigned to the students during the summer should be designed by teachers. Teachers know all the requirements that a student needs to excel in their class. If a student designs the project he or she will make it to the ability where it is easy on them instead of actually learning from the project.

Every year many teachers have lesson plans that they go by to get their students to the requirements needed to pass their class. When a teacher assigns a project during the summer it is to prepare the student for the upcoming year. A teacher designs the project in a certain way where the student can obtain information during the summer instead of forgetting it completely. For example, a history teacher assigns a summer project every year. He assigns it so his students can be prepared for the first lesson that he is going to go over. He wants his students to have background information about the material for better understanding. The project could actually be very helpful because instead of going into the class not knowing anything at all a student can at least go with the information he or she learned from doing the summer project. The projects designed by the teachers in the summer are to help a students achieve great things in their class.

If a student was able to design his or her own summer project, it will probably lead to them not getting any information from it at all. A student does not know all the requirements needed for their upcoming class. The student will probably create the project where it is less work on themselves. Not many students want to do work during their summer break. Many students already do not even want a summer project assigned. I had a chance to create my own project during the summer one year for my English class; it did not turn out very well. I created the project where I did not have to do a ton of work on it because it was my summer break, and I wanted to enjoy it. The reason why it did not turn out well because I created the project with not enough for information because I did not want to waste my time on a summer project. Which also leaded to me not learning anything from it at all. When the first day of class came I knew absolutely nothing that my teacher was talking about. Then realized If my teacher had created the summer project I feel like I would of obtained way more information because she knows all the goals that need to be reached to succeed in her class.

Many students believe that they should be able to design their own summer projects because they feel like they should have a chance to assign themselves something that they are actually interested in. However, it is better for a teacher to design the summer project because the teacher knows all the information that a student needs to be successful in their class. It is better for a student to have information about what they actually need to know to pass the class than something that just interests them. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
1F06A4B670A1,"Imagine being on break an a student has to to do a project on bird which can be very boring and not interesting. Now the student is confused about the concept of the essay and is starting to give up. So break is about to end in the student is not motivated at all to finish project. Now the student stressed and worried if he/she is going to finish or not. Summer projects should be student-designed because it is less stressful, students will be more organized, and it will teach students how to be independent.

First students will be more focused on the project because it is coming from the students perspective and not assigned from a teacher. This can also help students with being more responsible. For an example a person is working and your boss tells he/she to do something and that person do not do it. There is an big chance of that person getting fired because he/she did not do what they we're suppose to do. which can affect what they do in their life and can impacted the way they handle situation.

Second student will be more interested because students are designing the project other than just a teacher telling them what to do. This could also help with students being more organized when it comes to importuning things. For an example my friend was looking for an expensive pair of shoes that he put somewhere in his closet. But he can't find them in there because his closet is a complete mess. But if he was organized than he would not had lost them in his closet. This shows if your not organized then theirs a possibilities that you might misplace something thats importuning.

This can also teach students how to do things independent and do things alone.

This can show that students always not going to have someone to ask for help or someone to guide them. This is going to help them to find a way through because in life it is not going to always be easy. For an example, My dad was battling cancer and he had a lot of obstacles in his life but he always managed to fight threw the battle. Their we're times he was down but he always managed to pick himself up. This show that there is always going to be problems but just dont give up.

Finally students can now enjoy their break and not have to worry about the teacher with the uninteresting project. Summer projects should be student-designed because it is less stressful, students will be more organized, and it will teach students how to be independent. ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
7DF12B42AB72,"Should these summer projects be teacher designed or student designed? I feel they should be more favored to being student designed. Why would I think that? Why can't teachers determine the design of summer projects? Im going to tell my opinon why.

I feel students should be favored in the designing of their summer projects because they know what type of schedule they have. During most summers, students are going with families, going out of state, even sometimes they are going out of the country. If they have their own designed summer projects then they will know when to try and complete the projects on their own time. Plus, students take the summer time to have fun, and if teachers were designing these projects, it would be unfair to cut into the summer of students.

Now, I'm going to a teachers point of view for this one. Maybe most teachers feel that if students really cared about learning and school, that it doesn't matter when the project is assigned to you, you should just do it. Also, teachers may think with all the time during the summer, students should have plenty of time to balance managing their summer fun with their summer projects. In some teachers head, I think they may be saying if you care enough to learn and keep your brain and mind focused during the break, doing the projects when they assign they should be no issue at all. That is my take from the perspective of the teacher side of things.

Having already explained my reasonings for why summer projects should be in the favor of the students, now im going to give some key specific examples why I think that reasoning. Let's just say for example there's a kid that is going on a trip with his family and he is excited and ready to go, but all of a sudden, he gets a notification from his teacher that he has some summer projects to due over his break. Now the problem is not the teacher assigning the assignments, but the timing of the teacher giving the assignment is just not right in my opinon. More than likely now, the kid is still very amped to go on the trip, only thing now is that in the back of his mind he's thinking ""When am I going to start on my summer project"", and me personally, I would hate to have that feeling during such an adventful time. That is my first example for this topic.

With all of the first example being explained, here is my second example reguarding this topic. Let's just say for the sake of arugment, you have a member of your family, or somebody real close to you like a friend, and for some tragic reason, they end up being sick or becoming unhealthy on themselves. Maybe whatever is wrong with them gets to point of possibly ending up in the hosiptial and you go up to the hospital to see them, now I know your thinking im reguarding off the topic, but im getting to it now. Anyways, you go up to the hopsital to see what's wrong, and while your there making sure your friend is okay and grieving for them, teachers are still giving you these projects to learn about and in that moment, do you really feel like doing an assignment ?; I don't really think so. My point out of everything I just said is the timing these teachers are giving throughout the summer break can come at the most pleasent times for students, and that's what they need to understand. There's a time and place for eveything and sometimes, it's really the best to let the student decide when to design their summer projects, so they'll know when and where to do it at.

Finally, my last example for this very curious topic. This time im going to the example of the students point of view. What's the problem with students designing their summer project? It's not hurting anybody, it's at their own type of pace, they are not being rushed into something they may not be ready for, and I could go on and on about it. In the students' mind, they probably think if they design their own time to do the summer projects, when they are done with the assignments, the work will more than likely be more proifficent and way more precise, rather than teachers trying to assign them the assginments at the wrong time for some students. I would that the teachers would take that to head and be more aware of what students have going on. That was last, and final example of why students should design their own projects during the summer time.

In conclusion, I feel I gave my 100% best effort to give my specific reasons and examples on why students should design their own projects during the summer break. Just to review of what I really was talking about in my paragraphs, I brouught up almost every perspective I could've given. The students side of view, the teachers side of view, even from families views' as well. I tried to cover every single point of view and put everything into consideration. It wouldn't be fair to just leave out specific details and examples because that's when you start to lose all type of creditability for any argument you are trying to make. To me, I felt that students had the better argument because at the end of the day, it's really all bout what they think and how they feel. They are the having to do these assignments and a certain time, and actually be expected to put everything to the task. For the familes point of view, knowing that their kid can't have the type of summer they want to have because of these summer projects just doesn't sit right in my book. Lastly, but not leastly, the teachers point of view. I completely understand that even during the break, students should still keep their mind focused, in order to prepare for not only the next school year, but the many years to come after that. But, then again this refers back to the students who have to do the work at a not so good time for them. Honestly, I think their should be no work, or assignments given to students during the summer break. It's really not that not worth if the students aren't going to give their 100% best effort to even try to do it. This will not conclude my arguments for them.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
D3F48B4D2D6B,"Most students heavily disagree with having to complete summer assignments during their break, but they don't realize just how beneficial the assignments are for them. Summer assignments provide a foundation of background knowledge for the student upon arrival of the next school year, which puts them ahead in the long run. In order for a summer assignment to be as beneficial as possible, they should be designed by the teachers because they have acquired the knowledge and experience of how the curriculum is structured, they can provide proper insight of how the class will, and it'll provide a consistent base for student learning.

An assignment should be planned and designed by someone who is very familiar with the curriculum's structure. A teacher will be able to create a summer assignment that will portray the curriculum so that students can grasp the main concepts and requirements for the class. When a teacher has been teaching for many years, they are able to learn the ins and outs of the curriculum, so then they are able to manipulate it in a way that allows students to get the best from the class. Summer assignments are the foundation of a class, so it would be more beneficial to use experienced teachers to build and secure a strong foundation. The summer assignment would be structured with the curriculum in mind, which permits the students to get the most from the assignment because the curriculum has been molded in a way that is easy to grasp by students.

A summer assignment should be able to provide insight on what a student may experience in class. The assignment can provide the student with a preview of the class' standards and expectations,which are established by the teachers. For example, a student has signed up for a course that is not academically challenging, by completing the summer assignment they will be able to see that it isn't challenging and request to be placed in a higher leveled and paced course. An assignment created by a teacher also provides insight to the pace of the course, and students can see if any modifications can be done. If a student is having problems completing or understanding the summer assignment they are given the opportunity to ask for courses that have slight modifications in order to provide the best method of learning for the student. A summer assignment designed by a teacher would allow students to gain knowledge of the course, and allows them to establish changes or modifications that would conform to their learning styles.

All students should be able to begin the school year with similar foundations of the courses they are in. A teacher is able to design an assignment that will allows students to begin the school year with similar background knowledge. Having students start the year with similar foundations prevents an imbalance in academic motivation. Students may begin to feel unmotivated if an equal opportunity for learning isn't established in the beginning of a school year. Summer assignments designed by teachers also let students prepare more efficiently for a class. The students are able to gain confidence about a class since they are able to start the year off without having to worry about others having more background knowledge. A teacher-designed summer assignment allows students to begin the year with an equal opportunity to learn.

Summer assignment are able to provide the most benefits for students when they are designed and structured by teachers. Although some say a student-designed assignment allows for more student creativity, it doesn't establish a strong foundation of knowledge on the course. A teacher has experience with the curriculum, which allows them to structure the assignment in a manner that provides insight on the course and establishes equal opportunity among students. A strong foundation is required to achieve the best out of every course, and the foundation strengthens with knowledge that can only be provided by an experienced teacher.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
FCBE588E47E4,"The summer project shouldnt be made at all. because both students and teachers need a break from school . School shouldnt occur in the summer thats everyone break time from school. I also Believe that if the school should have a summer project i think that the; students should design it because after all the students are gonna be the ones working on it and the teachers are just gonna have to grade them. But the other bad part about it is some students are lose it most likely. And also i dont think that the teachers are gonna wanna grade a whole bunch of papers on the first day back .Its summer no every kid is gonna be focused on a project from school. The smarter thing to do would be to give the students the project on the first week back from summer break . so that way the students would not really have a choice but to do the project. Back to what i was saying,students should design the project so that way they get to make it how they want colors,designs and,etc. And if the students design it that might make them wanna do the summer project. If teachers design it students might no be as interested in doing the project because its not some thing they made on there own so it doesnt have any meaning to them . Moral of the story i dont really think that students should have a project in the summer time;but since they are getting one I think that they should be the ones designing it .",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
8940AE811882,"Summer is a time to relax and enjoy a break from the various amounts of school work and learning done throughout the school year. Students often forget the curriculum by not being in school, so schools brought the idea of summer projects. Summer projects are a great way to bring in learning outside of school and still be able to have fun either with friends or oneself. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because, it will enable students to follow a proper guideline,it will helps students transition into future careers that require projects,and it will give students more time to enjoy summer.

However,others may argue that student-designed projects are more beneficial because students will be able to demonstrate more creativity. According to a variety of students,by being able to design the summer projects, students will want to actually complete this mandatory task and not get bored doing it. Students do not want to be given a lot of work,so by letting them choose their project it will help them take an easier route as to what they would want to do .Although this could be true,but there is not enough evidence to support this claim. Therefore, students would be better of completing a teacher-designed project.

To begin,teacher based projects will provide students with a proper guideline to fulfill this requirement. Students can often become confused with what they are being told to do and usually do not bother asking. This leads to going off task and the student is affected by this obstacle. By having a guideline it will help keep students on task by checking off what they have completed. This will also provide directions that can be simply followed with a detailed explanation as to what they need to do. Students can be more focused on the task and not give them too much of a hassle to deal with. Guidelines will ensure students are doing given projects correctly and acquire a good grade expected from each individual. Students usually do not perform well when they are not given any directions and are just told to do it. It gives students an advantage to abuse this and complete however they would like because they were not told exactly what to do. A proper guideline will give these students an ability to follow each step and have similar outcomes when comparing work with other students. Guidelines are a way to obtain a good grade at the beginning of the year and give students satisfaction and want to participate more in school. It will create a postive enviorment to all students.

Secondly,students can transition easier into future careers they choose by doing teacher-designed projects. In the work environment many companies and other businesses require projects in order to make sure that their business is doing well and to keep up to date with information in order to inform other employees. Teacher-designed projects will help students prepare to tackle any given project by designing them to be specific and goal-based. This will give students an opportunity to gain skills and many insights that can be helpful when writing a resume and provide more open doors when looking for a job. It is also a great way to challenge themselves and be able to expect whatever comes their way. Students usually do not expect a lot in school because they are not given hard of a task because it is simplified down for learning purposes. This gives them the idea that it will be the same when having a job,which is not the case. Students need to acknowledge that there are different expectations to completing projects. The skills they gain in high school or college will be very important. By doing teacher based projects students will not regret what they have learned since it will benefit them greatly later on.

Finally,students will be able to enjoy more of their summer. Students do not like having to do summer work because it is a time where they finally can relax after being in school for 9 months. Summer break is 6 months less than that. Ensuring teacher-designed projects,students would not have to think of an idea for a project. Students get stress by doing a lot of work and that could harm them when it comes to their education. Teacher projects will give students less stress than they need. With this teachers can easily grade them faster and be less of a stress to them as well. In this case it is a win-win situation. Students want as much time they can before having to go back to school in August. Projects created by the teachers will give students a quicker opportunity to finish instead of having to create a project that can take time away from their relaxation. Students would then not mind a project in the summer and will help them stay up to date with their education.

In the end students would be better of with a teacher-designed project because it is more beneficial to them in their future careers, relaxation time, and following directions. This will helps students grow into a better version of them self and let them be able to help others when doing a project. The argument above shall support this reason and should be taken to account when given out summer work to students. If this is a debate in your local school district, begin a petition and send it to the school superintendent.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
81C85E0925CC,"Summer vacation, the eye of the storm between last school year and the next. Summer vacation is the period students get to relax and enjoy their time off, feel and experience warm weather, or hang out with friends. Whatever it may be that students do on this time off it's important they feel in control, and what they do makes good use of their time. Unfortunately some students don't get the same luxury as others and must complete school projects assigned by teachers or schools. When teachers assign these projects, students may feel very constricted on what they have to do, their creativity may be pushed to the side, and it may not even get completed because some students could lack the motivation to do it at all. The solution to this? A student assigned project is the best fix to the problems experienced by many and can make the task more digestible for a student, and perhaps an enjoyable experience.

Students often get overwhelmed by large projects, the colossal tasks feel like a burden to a student. Even when stretched out over a two to three month period, it can seem unapproachable in the moment. When the student can decide on what they want to do a project on, it feels like a much more realistic goal. Often teachers will give a packet of guidelines and requirements, this leaves very little wiggle room in what a student can add to a preset project. Students will commonly be assigned a very specific subject or topic, it can feel like one's summer is at the whim of a slip of a paper in a hat. It's almost demoralizing to get a topic that has little information to find on it or is buried deep in old and musty books, not touched for years. Another problem isn't just mental walls, but as well as ""pay-walls"" where a user must pay to access information on a subject on the internet that can't be found anywhere else. When all of these problems are at play it can feel absolutely impossible to complete a summer project.

The biggest Pro to be found with a student chosen project is that the creativity derived from choosing and designing one's own poster board, PowerPoint, or creation. The process of choosing, researching, and creating a project of a student's choice can be incredibly rewarding. To a student, it feels like they have free will in what they're working on, and that they are influencing the outcome of their own work. Some students may never get this opportunity to work on something at their own free will, this may make them feel very trapped in the monotony of their schoolwork. As a student becomes and adult, if they don't get enough opportunities such as these, they may never have developed the free thinking aspect of working on something. There are plenty of books or objects of media that feel very flat and uninteresting, but instilling the idea of creativity and free thought in school can be very beneficial from a process such as allowing a self chosen project in the time of academic study.

A point to be brought up in this discussion should be that of ""Where to draw the line of when the amount of leeway given is too much."" This is a great point because a student can get lost in not knowing what to choose or the guideline given was too vague. While this does seem to be a realistically good question, a teacher most likely wouldn't give an assignment like that. One example of this is a book project where a student is assigned to find any non-fiction book detailing a person, and then create a presentation on them, with a rubric to grade the PowerPoint. This seems to be a very good example, where a student needs to do the research but the possibilities of who a student can read about is immense. If a student embraces the freedom this project allows a great presentation can flourish and spark passion about this assignment. When a student cares about what they're working on they will have the motivation to come back to it time and time again to complete it, not getting lost in the possibilities of choice.

Many students daydream about what they'll do with their summer, the last thing a school should do is weigh that experience down with a monotonous project. It should be the student's job to choose the topic of their project, not a teacher's or the school's. It's unfortunate how often a project will be assigned for a student, as it snuffs creativity and can feel very challenging for a student to work through. If schools do care about how a student matures and develops their critical thinking, free will, and creativity, student chosen projects should not be rare, but commonplace. The only way to promote free and creative thinking is to have more self chosen projects, and summer projects would be the perfect place to start.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
2352FF50900C,"Nine out of ten students always say that most projects should be based on what they want to do, so it is not as dull as doing a teacher assigned on a specific topic. Teachers do have some great ideas when it comes down to projects but some students can show more creativity when they can decide on the project they want to work on. Students also can learn more from a topic they chose for the project for that particular class because they go out to find more information about the topic they think they might enjoy. Summer projects should be student-designed because it shows more creativity, it shows their learning abilities, and it allows the student to pace themselves.

Showing creativity is a big factor when it comes down to projects because students always want to show their best work. When a teacher assigns a project their are usually some type of regulations they must follow for the project and you are only allowed to talk about specific topics. This for students does not allow for creativity because they will only follow what the teacher's checklists has so they can get the best grade possible. While yes, teachers usually assign projects so a student does not go off topic, but this can be easily fixed by simply showing some topics they can use but not forcing the topics on the students to use it and also allow students to find something about that topic or something that can relate to that topic. Student-designed projects allows the students to make the most effort out of the topic they chose because the student shows that is the topic the student wants to talk about it is like a sport most professional sports player do not play a sport they do not like. Players play a sport where the player can see the most effort from themselves or which sport allows the player to show the most creativity in that sport. Like Messi named as the best soccer player in the world because of his creativity with the ball and all the effort that is put into every game.

When it comes down to projects the teacher is always looking for what they learn from a project that student worked on but most students do not really learn well about the topic because the student did not want to learn about that topic it was given to them by the teacher. So, they will go on to just read something the student finds online and just copies most of the information about what that student read and make something similar. When a student is allowed to pick a topic they have to find information about that topic and will try harder to make it one of their better projects for themselves. While yes, the student can use online sources and copy information from that source but they will try harder to explain it in their own words because that is the top the student wanted to talk about and wants to make an effort to show what they are capable of doing when the student is allowed to pick an idea for their own project.

During a project a lot of planning ahead must come to mind the student will have to rush the projects as they would if it had deadlines for each couple of weeks. This allows the student to pace themselves and not feel that their project was rushed and they are not just putting all the work in one day. most students during projects tend to feel rushed because they feel they are not given enough time to do it while yes most students could still possibly finish the project last minute the overall feeling of planning ahead can help them to show hoe much work they put into the project everyday. A student tends to be a big procrastinator so when they pace themselves it allows the student to see if they can take a break for a day or not. When we look at adult projects they prepared to explain the topic because they plan accordingly and they pace themselves so they are not stressing out too much for their project.

While yes, a teacher-designed project may be good for a student, a student-designed project is much better because it can show people great creativity, it allows a student to learn better, and it allows the student to better prepare themselves. Most students tend to see that their designs help them more because it shows they put more effort into their projects to allow a teacher to see where they are at.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
C712BBBA5BF5,"Homework over the summer. An idea so devastating, many students would rather not think of it at all. However, summer homework is a necessary evil, one that allows more rigorous classes to get an early start, so that student have prior knowledge of what the class will be like, and a better understanding of the course content. While many students would thoroughly enjoy making their own summer project, they should be created by the teachers, because it would help the projects make sense, give an adequate understanding of course difficulty, and it would create a central knowledge foundation for all student taking the class.

When students create projects for themselves, they don't always work like desired. Students have lots of wild ideas, and they all have a different understanding of various topics. A student creating a project will tend toward researching things they are already interested in, or something they think is easy. Many students, no matter what class they take, will always opt for the easier alternative. While that isn't all students, the overachievers are the exception, not the rule. If students were to craft their own summer assignments, they would make it something easy for them, and something they don't have to work particularly hard for. A teacher needs to be the one who creates such an assignment, because their objective view of the difficulty of the assignment and their understanding of what the class requires will keep the project focused on what needs to be done, rather than an easy piece of paper with facts the student already knew.

Classes that require summer homework are often among the more difficult classes, and thus the teacher needs to help students be aware of what they have signed up for. If a student creates their own assignment, it may not give an realistic idea of what to expect in the course. This could cause confusion and unpreparedness when the course begins, and would upsets students who didn't realize what the course would be like, causing them to drop the class, even though they might be able to succeed in the more rewarding, more challenging class. A teacher who understands the course material and the difficulty of said material would be the best one to assign anything for that class, but especially a summer assignment designed to prepare students for the upcoming class.

Every student is very different. Some enjoy sports, while some others enjoy academics. Some love history, other adore English, and still more are math geniuses. Since every student has so many differing ideas, why sould they make their own subjective summer projects? If the students were to create their own assignments, one of two things would happen. Either each student would create their own, individual/small group projects, which would cause each student to be prepared very differently for the course, and would see each student knowing small chunks of their basic course fundamentals, or the entire class would create their assignment, which would cause discourse between students who have different knowledge bases, and would lead to arguments and disagreements, and very little would get done by the people the project didn't favor. The teacher needs to create an assignment that gives each student a solid foundation in the course, and would give each student what they need to thrive in their class.

All in all, while students would love to create their own assignments where they learn about what they enjoy and do as little work as possible, that would simply be impractical, and it would be better for teacher who know the information needed to create an assignment correctly. After all, since they went to school to learn how to teach effectively, they shouldn't ever need the students to create a project themselves.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
8C7930D181C3,"During a students summer break many go on vacation, some work, others may use their summer break to relax and have fun. During this almost three month period, do students retain information that will be needed in there upcoming school year? Most likely not, because of this some schools make it a requirement that students do summer projects to stay productive during the break. Should students be able to design there own summer project? I believe that summer projects should be teacher designed to make sure that the information is useful for the upcoming school year and every student will get the same important information.

Summer projects assigned are made in an effort to keep students proactive in a time were there isn't much learning being done. Teacher designed projects would ensure that the skills used and information given to students is useful and will make the transition into the upcoming school year easier. Who better to design projects then the people that will be teaching students the up coming year. Teachers have a schedule of what they will be teaching once students come back, therefore, they would be able to give projects that are related to the topics that will be taught in the classroom. I have personally had teacher-designed summer projects or assignments from certain classes, and have found them helpful. My government teacher assigned a packet were every student would have to give descriptions about each amendment and article of the constitution. Although in the moment I didn't understand how that would help me, I found it very helpful when the class started to talk about civil rights and court cases used as precedents. If i had the choice to design my own summer project i wouldn't know what to do, and i certainly would not have chosen to study the constitution. Teacher designed summer projects make sure each student is getting the needed information for the next school year.

A benefit of having a teacher-designed project is that everyone is learning the same information. Giving students the choice to design there own summer project may allow each student to be creative and have fun, but it also gives them the ability to neglect possible important information. For example, one student may do intensive research on the cold war and another student may do research on the civil rights movement. Both are learning over the summer, but one is more prepared for a certain topic then the other. This could confuse the first student and could cause him or her to struggle when coming back from break. Teacher designed projects would ensure that each student is on the same page and also gives him or her the opportunity to talk to peers and consult about the new information given to the student over a time were there is no teacher that could help clarify. Summer projects designed by teachers ensure that every student is getting the same important information to prepare them for the following year.

Some may say that teachers assign to much and that if students were to design the summer projects it would be better to fit into their summer schedules, but I believe if students were given that opportunity they would try to do the least and easiest amount of work. Yes, students may have things like jobs, internships or may simply be out of the country, which could make it difficult to complete teacher designed projects; but lets be honest, many kids put there summer projects off until last minute. I am guilty of this myself. When something is done last minute it is probably not gonna be that well dont, but on top of that the students are allowed to do there own thing, which could lead to many students doing the bare minimum. If each student were at liberty to do their projects as they see fit it would give him or her the liberty to put little effort into the project and not actually retain the needed information that was intended to get to them. Student designed summer projects gives students the chance to give mediocre projects and to learn unnecessary information.

In conclusion, schools should assign teacher-designed projects during the summer because it allows each student to learn the same information as his or her peers and it prepares them for the up coming year with the information the teachers knows will be important. During a students break kids should be able to have fun, but they also need to stay ready for the next school year. The best way to prepare students for a new school year over a break is by giving out teacher designed summer projects rather then student designed summer projects.

Alumni will be the most prepared with teacher designed projects compared to student designed projects when returning to school at the beginning of the school year.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
1A067085A035,"""School sucks, school is boring,"" everyone has either said this before or has heard it before, to make school not boring you have to allow students to learn the topics that interest them and that they feel are important to know. Students who are given the opportunity to pursue their own ideas, topics, and imagination will better prepare them for the project and just life in general. The teachers are there to help students learn and understand ideas, but students one day will have to learn to make their own decisions and grow up. Students love and enjoy school when they learn about topics that interest them, entertain them, and even challenges them. If schools that require summer projects they should allow students to choose their own topics because students will recall the information they learned, allows the students to grow up and mature off their own decisions, and will expand their imaginations.

Expanding ones imagination might be the single most important thing a school can do for a student. When Martin Luther King said "" I have a dream,"" that wasn't something he read out a book, or saw in class, it was him imagining a better life for his family, friends, and all people who were fighting for equal rights. Imagination is the key to having a happy life, you get to learn about things that you would never think of, and even become something you would never think would ever happen, like becoming a contractor. Giving students the chance to make their own decisions for themselves is possibly the best thing you can do for them to allow them to grow up. If you can believe the impossible, think the unthinkable, believe the unbelievable, then why is it hard for schools to allow their students to do so.

When students don't care about what your teaching and have no motivation to learn the topic, students will just not pay attention and recall nothing that you have taught. Being able to recall information and understand it well is very important, but most students can't just recall information that they don't care about at all. Allowing a student to choose a topic for one project for summer could be the way to getting to know a student, or to just allow them to learn information that they didn't even know they enjoy. Recalling information is part of the human brain, but the less you like and enjoy the information the less your gonna remember what you learned. Teachers will not always provide the greatest projects so letting students choose will allow them to learn and even recall what they learned because they actually care about the topic.

Becoming an adult includes maturing, and being able to make decisions yourself, then why do we get told what to do twenty-four seven at school. If babied throughout the rest of school we will never mature enough for the real world, which will leave a rude awakening for most kids. All it takes is one little thing like allowing us to pick our project, it will give us the responsibility we need to become better students and overall better humans. ""How can we trust you to actually do it,"" some might say, it could be true some students might choose not to do it, which is dumb but could happen, doesn't mean it will, but you will have to put trust in students at some point because they are the next generation. All that has to happen is to put a little faith in each and everyone of your students and see what happens. Just give it a try, you gotta start somewhere.

Expanding students imaginations, allowing them to mature and grow up, and allowing students to recall important information is all schools have to do for students, so why make life hard and make students do things that they don't want to do at all, allow them to choose their topics. Allow their imaginations take over the world, allow them to make mistakes and just allow them to learn the right way. I'll leave you with this when your gone who's gonna be left to take over the earth, so treat each student the way you would want to be treated.         ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
E651190656B1,"""Summer is for fun and not for learning"" people argue often. So the questions are asked ""Should school summer brake projects be teacher based or student based?"" Schools should provide a student based summer project for rising students because the projects allows students minds to work properly, brain to develop better, and the projects prepare the students for the new school year.

Its a well known proven fact that brain games helps the brain function working in different situations. An some brain games could even be therapeutic to some or if not all people. Our brains ever shut off, even when asleep, the brain continues to work. An with all the gear work in our heads we need to exercise it often or those gears would get clogged and not work properly. the summer projects for students is a great stress reliever or a great exercise for the mind. With the summer projects given to students to continue to learn, it would help those gears work and their brain to continue development even while having summer fun.

In all cases the brain is the control center in our bodies. An with the brain being so important to our bodies, it needs proper development to function properly in the real world. So starting summer projects at a young age could help major brain development in the future for students. The projects could help students become smarter through out the years of them continuously learning and keeping their brains processing every day brain games. With the daily brain projects given over summer break it allows the brain to work continuously and that allows the brain development to grow.

An with exercising the mind and brain development the summer project also prepares students for the upcoming year and reviewing last school year lessons. An with reviewing last years lessons it refreshes a students mind with old content, while keeping it new at the same time. Even with the old lessons it helps up learn the new lessons as be work our minds to learn them. An learning the new lessons gives students a head start in the next school year. Whether we know it or not, learning something new is what the brain craves for every day and feeding its hunger with new lessons could help the development and prepare them in the future and not just school.

Some people may argue that summer was made for students to have fun and not learn, but school projects are a healthy way to keep the mind intact. The projects keeps the mind processing every day life situations. An with the mind processing properly it helps brain development and brain development is what we consider inelegance in this society. Even with brain development it prepares student for the future, whether is for school or life outside if the classroom. the summer projects should be student bases because allows students minds to work properly, the brain to develop better, and prepare the students for the new school year or thee life ahead.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
57DA3FB70989,"What if students could design their own summer projects? As the summer gets closer and closer, some schools assign summer projects to its students. These projects are mean't to keep students' minds refreshed on materials they have learned in school. Projects designed by students and teachers are different and can show many different views. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers are well equipped to teach in their field.

Students are are more creative than teachers and have the option of making their project easier for other students. Most students attempt to stay with the latest trends in school, which means some students can have a similar mind set as each other and can receive an easy project to complete. But not all students are prepared or knowledgeable to create a project that will teach other students what they need to know. For example, if a student creates a project based on a game or sport, the other student may not know anything about it and will have to put more effort in. Or if a student creating a project gives unclear instructions, students attempting to do the project may incorrectly complete it. Student-created projects could be easier for other students, but some students will either know nothing on the topic given to them, or ,if given vague instruction, will unintentionally fail the project due to a misunderstanding.

Teachers have gone through proper education in school, they have majored in their subject and know more than the average person. Teachers take advanced classes in order to learn more about their subject. Teachers have studied about their subject and specialize in containing the knowledge in order to teach students what they know. Teachers learn in deeper understanding of the topics that are taught to them and should be able to come up multiple ways to teach what they have learned to their students. After teachers have completed required classes, they will earn a bachelor's degree to show that they are verified to start teaching. Even after finishing their required courses, teachers can still take extra classes to expand their knowledge to teach their students and help them understand more in the future. Teachers are properly educated and will teach students what they know so that students are able to comprehend the information and utilize it in the future.

Teachers must be trained and prepared to teach their students in a way where their students can be engaged and gain the material that is taught to them. Teachers are taught to express interest in their work and to their students so that the students are more willing to learn the material from their teachers. For example, if a teacher shows no interest or enthusiasm, students also may not be interested or enthusiastic about learning the subject. Teachers should learn what is fascinating about their subject to teach their students in a way where they will keep interest and learn. Teachers should be engaging with their students and stay on topic so that students will take them seriously, even though this may not be something that is taught to teachers, it is still very important because it will show how much teachers care about their students and their subject. Teachers are well prepared and trained to deal with students and teach them in a way where they will be interested and engaged in their work.

Teachers are well educated and prepared to teach students, they are always willing to learn more from their students and fellow teachers. If teachers learn more from their students, future students will benefit from their teacher, understanding more than previous students. For example, if a student happens to gain knowledge about something their teacher didn't know and applied it in their project, the teacher would learn from their student and could apply it to their teaching or use it for next generation of students. After teaching in their classes, teachers may go out and continue taking advanced classes to further their education even more, so that they can be prepared to answer questions from students, or give them advice so that they will learn and understand to use what they've learned. Teachers are are prepared and educated to teach students, but there is no harm in learning more in their field to teach students new, useful material that they have acquired. Teachers, despite their education, can always learn something new from their students.

Teachers are well prepared to handle students in many ways because of their education, training, and their ability to continue learning. Teachers will know what to teach to their students and how to express the information while engaging with their students without having them lose interest. Teachers will continue to learn from their fellow teachers and students to teach future students the new material that they have learned. Teachers have learned enough to be verified to begin teaching others on their subject.

DECDC46197E4,"Should student projects be designed by teachers or students? They should be designed by students, they can choose a topic that they would prefer or something that isn't too hard on them. Sometimes teachers assign work that is difficult for students to complete, and without a teachers help during the summer you could be lost with the directions they give you. Teachers could give out a really confusing rubric for the project, a student might not understand what they must do to meet the proper criteria for the project. The teacher is out for summer break too, they probably dont have the time to check their e-mail constantly to help you out when your stuck so if students would design their own projects they wouldnt have the stress and hardship of a teacher designed project.

If students could design their own projects they would be able to work freely without a confusing rubric and the trouble of having to wait for a teacher to e-mail you back. Not all students want to be told by teachers to make a diorama or make a poster, some students dont have the time or resources for that, If its the summer then students want to be out on vacation, helping out their parents, or getting jobs. If they could create a project that doesnt interfere with that then that would be great for them. If they are able to manage their time then they can take time making a project instead of rushing through it to get it done in what little time they have.

But assigning this task to students is a great way for them to show their work ethic, some students could surprise their teacher by showing them how well they can accomplish a task without someone supervising them the whole time. Its a great way for them to be prepared for life after school. Sometimes you will have to complete tasks on your own with no help and you need to be prepared for that or its going to be hard on you if you've never had an experience before hand.

Student designed projects are also a great way for students to be creative and to show their creativity. If all the students were assigned a project on the same exact topic, many of them will turn the same exact projects in. But if they were able to have creative control then they can diversify their projects, lets say you were assigned a history project, this project was about photosynthesis, Many students would turn in a plant cell thats labeled with all the parts of the cell and then they would either label a paper with how plants photosynthesize or why they do it. Most if not all of the projects would be similar, unless they were able to choose them on their own. If they could choose they could do a project on How the Rocky Mountains were formed, or how active the Ring of Fire is. Then the projects would be more interesting to not only the teacher but the students.

Another reason on why students should have the freedom to create their own projects is that they wouldnt have been assigned a project that they find boring, The chances are if a student is bored with their work, they are not going to do a good job on it. They didnt have the motivation of learning or finding it interesting, they just simply want to get it done and over with. But if they do a project they find interesting, not only could they be happy with their work but they would would most likely preform a better job than if they didnt. Not only would they be satisfied with being able to have freedom over their work, but they would be satisfied with the work they put into it.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
67E48B0CB147,"Students should design their own summer projects instead of teachers telling them how to do it. Its a great way for students to be creative and be able to express how they want to. It can also teach them responsibility. Summer projects are supposed to be fun for the students and when teachers tell them how to, they aren't going to want to do it.

Students have creative minds. They all think and learn differently. When students are able to be creative with something they enjoy doing it. Being creative is a big thing kids need in life that's how new ideas come out because people are thinking creatively. When teachers tell them how they want it done there's no room for their creativity. Children need to show how creative they can be in their own way.

Students have different needs, different strengths, different interests. Some might like writing an essay others might like using pictures to express about their summer. Everyone is different, their projects should be different also. If a student wants to make a PowerPoint about their summer they should, or a student might want to write a paper about it. Students should be able to do whatever they want with their projects. Teachers telling them how to do it, students aren't gonna want to do it.

Having a long term project like a summer project can show students how to be more responsible about it. Students will learn to keep up with their things and manage their time with the project and other activities. Teaching children responsibility at a young age will increase their chances of being responsible as they get older. It can also teach them how to manage time between things they need to do and things they wants to do.

Students need to do their own projects without guild lines or a certain way to do it. Students need to be creative and be able to express in a way their comfortable with and a way they like doing it. They also need to learn to take responsibility for their own things instead of teachers hovering over them making sure thier doing it right. Teachers should sit back and let the students do their project how they want not what the teachers want. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
68E95519CBCA,"There are some schools that require students to continue their learning and growth through summer projects. Some teachers and students alike agree that this would be beneficial to the minds of the kids who go away for the summer and don't retain the knowledge that they've gained. Though there is some argument on who should be the ones to design them, the teachers or the students? The students should definitely have the liberty to choose and design the structure of these summer-long projects to ensure that they enjoy what they're doing while they learn. It's been proven that, when you enjoy the task at hand, you will typically receive more pride of the work you've done and more knowledge.

When school lets out for the summer each year, the kids aren't worried about saving their textbooks or notes they've taken over the course of the semester. From the end of May, right up til the beginning of August, the majority of students are totally oblivious to the notion of learning. They just want to kick back and do practically nothing for those few months. As wonderful and naive as that sounds, our minds do require that we keep a little stimulation on them so they stay sharp. So rather than assigning month's worth of home-work, schools have come up with a way to keep our brains fresh, without putting so much stress on them that it causes anxiety. Projects are a more creative way to keep your knowledge in check. This way, students could spread out certain aspects of the project during the duration of summer.

Not surprisingly though, this is causing problems between students and their teachers. They cannot decide who should design the projects. It's the students who are required to complete the projects, therefore they should be the ones to choose the structure of them. While teachers are worried about the material and criteria that the students have to cover, they don't really know the interests and ideas of all the kids. If you force a subject on a student that they genuinely hate for a summer long deal, they're just going to do a halfhearted job on it. For an everyday example, when ever my Trig teacher would assign a project in class, I somewhat cared about getting it done in the beginning, but after realizing that I really don't have any level of interest in trigonometry, I just kind of stopped caring. It's very well known that when someone has an interest in a subject they will plunge all of their effort into it.

If the teachers allow the students to choose their own path for the project, while still somewhat pertaining to the main subject, they would see more cooperation from the students. As a student, I know the agony of having to go through with an assignment or project that I hated, but that was during school, during summer, you should have some leniency. Students will typically make it more fun and add their personality when they have the opportunity to make a project their own. When they are held to so many guidelines, the projects often times look the same.

Looking at this from another angle, there are those who say it would be more beneficial to make it the teachers' task to design them. Well guess what, teachers are human and don't always know what's best for their students to learn. Each person learns differently in both ways and paces. When teachers design assignments, it's, this is what your assignment is and that's that. When students do it, it becomes more unique and beneficial for each one. Also, that way students can't just copy each other's work.

So all in all, there is no argument that schools should require summer long projects. While teachers know what is expected of the students, they don't always really know how each child learns best. So if they were to implement the freedom for the kids to choose what they want, they would see much better results in the minds of their students.           ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
71703F0C0ABD,"Students should design their own summer projects because they can make the project about things they learned over the summer or while they were in school. Having to the project in their own way should make it more better for the students to learn more on how to make a project, come up with ideas about the project, and get the feel on how to do things on their own without a teachers assistants. Having a project to do on you own makes things go easier for you without a teacher way of how they want the project to be. Although if a teacher designs the summer project for the students it will save the trouble of a student having to think of what their project should be about and the students will not just make the project on anything they shouldn't make it about.

Firstly, if the students design the project of their decisions they will feel more comfortable working on something they designed without a teachers opinion and they can do it at their own paste instead of having a teacher telling them when its due. And when students design the projects by them selves they get a chance to teach themselves more and learn more from their mistakes so when next time they have a project to do they will have it down packed. Also the students can take summer school where they can have access to book to help they with there summer project and computers where they can get resources to look up information about the project their designing. But students should take the project serious so they can understand how to make projects on their own so if a time comes when they to do it again without any assistants it will be more be better the next time.

Secondly, if the students design the summer project it will be more fun if they deign it because there friends can all help and work together to make the project fun and they can challenge each other to see who can make the best project and but also in a correct way. The project can also be fun because the project can be about things they like such as a favorite sport, favorite food, or even favorite place to go doing this should make the students more interested in doing the project on there own without a teacher. If the students can make the summer project more fun by making the the project about things they wanna or like doing it will push the the students to make to project strong and more topic related so that the students wont get off topic. Another way the students could make the project more fun is making it more about them so they can be relax and want to the project .

Thirdly, it helps the students practice more on projects if they design it their selves by doing this it teaches the students how to handle situation like this throughout life and they can over come that if they dont use help for a teacher or anyone. Also if they keep practicing how to make projects on their own they can help others in need of help making and thinking of ideas of how to make their project this is why know how to make project on your own helps out a lot. Making projects teaches you a lot about yourself you find out what you need help on and what your good at designing a project can be a lot of work but you can do it if you practice a lot if your doing them yourself. Practicing how to design project can be really helpful to you in so many ways and knowing how to make projects can help when your in school and needing to do a class project with other students that doesnt know how to make their own project.

In summary, students designing their own projects will better them if they have to make another project on there own rather in school, work, or even summer projects. Without a teacher designing the project for the students they can get ideas of how to do it there selves in need of a time to make projects by them self. Also if teachers design a project for students the students might not like the summer project the teacher assigned for them to do and they wont do the project in that case they wont learn anything. Therfore students should be allowed to design their own projects without a teacher idea of how it should be designed and they can make it how they want to without the teachers opinion and they will want to do it.    ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
7E54AA9ADF2B,"Today, the effect of summer break on students is debated as frequently as politics. Many are convinced that this long break causes students to forget material that they have just learned. Schools have tried to combat this issue in various ways; one way is to require summer projects. This would assure that students continue learning during their break. However, this solution begs the question of if these projects should be designed by the teachers or the students. Certainly, these projects should be left to the teacher. Summer projects should be teacher-designed to reduce the unnecessary amount of time spent on the project and stress on the students, insure the relevancy the project has to the course, and guarantee the teacher's help and structured guidelines.

First, if summer projects are teacher-designed, the amount of unnecessary time spent on the project and stress would reduce for the students. The time needed to plan and form a project would be solely on the teacher, not each individual student. This entire process can be very stressful and overwhelming, especially for a student who does not have a degree in the subject. The stress and frustration would continue, especially if a student cannot get approval. A student-designed project would require the student to present their project idea to the teacher for approval. Whereas a teacher-designed project would already be approved, eliminating the hassle of the first few steps in the project making process. For example, a high school student, Generic_Name, is going into an advanced science class. She has the idea to do a project where she will conduct a survey asking different people to pick their preferred flower from a list. The teacher denies her request because it does not reflect the class level. Generic_Name then has to go back and start from square one, frustrated and angry. A student may have to go back again and again, especially frustrated because it is wasting valuable time in the middle of their summer.

Second, teacher-designed projects would be relevant to the course. Students would be unaware of the topics related to the course they are going into, for they have not studied it yet. It would be impossible for them to form a beneficial project related to the subject. A teacher could use this project as a precursor to the unit they will study first, beginning to teach right when they get back to school. The students will have some background on the topic, ready to jump in. The students will then be able to have class discussions on the topic, because they all did the same project and are on the same page. For example, Generic_Name is a rising senior in high school going into an American literature class. He is told that he must complete a project over summer. He decides to read a biography on George Washington and do a report on the book. He has no idea that the first unit in the class is poetry. It would have been more beneficial to Generic_Name and the other students in that class if the teacher was able to assign the project. The teacher could have given the students many Edgar Allen Poe poems and assigned a thrilling project to go along with the mysterious and captivating works of Poe. Coming back from summer break, the class could discuss what they read and share their projects with each other. Having a teacher design a relevant project would unify the class and be a wonderful bridge to aid in the transition from summer into a new school year.

Lastly, clear guidelines and the teacher's help would be guaranteed if teachers design summer projects. With the teacher designing the project, they could make a clear and distinct rubric. This would inform students exactly what the teacher is looking for. It is very difficult to complete a project when you are not sure how it will be graded. Teachers would be able to help students and answer any questions they may have. For example, over the summer, Generic_Name has an assignment to research her favorite U.S. president and write a paper on their life. The teacher provides an over view of the assignment, a list of all the requirements, and a rubric. Generic_Name would like to add a page on the president's children. However, she is not sure if that is allowed, considering that the assignment was only on the president himself. She sends an email to her teacher and asks her question. The teacher is able to answer her question almost immediately, because the teacher knows exactly what they want. The teachers should formulate the projects, so they can assist the students and guide them. Some may argue that student-designed projects allow students to have creativity, individuality, and freedom. As a result of these things, students would be more inclined to complete the project; however, these self-assigned projects could easily be swept under the rug, especially in the midst of an exciting summer break. More time, thought, and preparation must go into a student designed project, discouraging students from setting aside appropriate time to devote to the project, because they view it as too challenging.

In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by teachers. This would be more beneficial to both students and teachers. The teachers would be able to assign projects that are relevant to their lesson, relating their summer work to the unit they will be studying first, allowing them to be able to start learning as soon as they get back to school. During the months of summer break, the last thing that students want is the stress of a project. It would be much easier and less stressful if the teachers designed the project to reduce the amount of preparation needed from the students. The teachers would give the students clear guidelines, and then be able to help the students because they have a distinct idea of what they are looking for. Summer projects should be teacher-designed to insure the relevancy of the project, guarantee structured guidelines, and limit the unnecessary stress for students. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
66418ED2289D,"Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?

On the first day of

Summer Break one is thinking about all the things he's going to be doing, like:relax all day, go on vacation, hang out with friends or family, play video games, and do non-school related things. Suddenly, he or she gets an email from their teacher saying,""I hope everyone is enjoying summer so far, over the summer you will have to do a project on what you have learned this year."" At the end of the email is the instructions the teacher says you have to do for your project. After reading the email one closes his laptop or turns off his phone with anger, because that one teacher ruined his summer.

How are people supposed to enjoy their summer break when a teacher gives them school-related stuff to do. Some teachers complain all the time about them having to grade all types of work when a student doesnt do his work. Teachers shouldn't complain because,all they had to do is not give students any work especially over the summer. Then that will make the teachers job way much easier, because they won't have much stuff to grade and worry about planning to do.

Summer projects should be student-designed because, first of all student-designed projects, our more relaxful then teacher-designed projects. Student-designed projects would show more creativeness, and is more helpful. Second, they can show how much one has learned. While teacher-designed projects are much more stressful, one will have to do it rule,by rule, by rule, one little mess up can lower your score by a whole grade. On teacher- designed projects the teacher also won't really tell who learned more, because they will all be very similar. Teacher-designed projects are also boring, because it's better when you can use your own ideas instead of someone else ideas. Teachers most of the time always give the people with the most perfectly organized project the best grade, when they dont even have good facts or anything about the project, while the people with not that good of organization but a lot of good information on the project get a lower grade.

One might ask, ""what is the reason for having a project during summer because that is when we have a break from school?""

That's just like saying,""why do athletes like basketball players practice during off season?"" If a athlete does not practice during off season, they can probably lose their skill, be out of shape,and not get any better for the next season. Just like if we dont have any projects or work over the summer we can forget how to do certain stuff, and not be ready for the next school year. I still dont agree with the idea of projects during summer though because thats what fourth quarter projects should be about. It should be about what you learned over the school year, instead of having to waste time in the summer doing a project . If one still had to do a project over the summer it should also be optional extra credit for the next school year. One shouldn't be forced to do school work over a time when you are supposed to be enjoying the summer off. One of my favorite sayings is from Allen Iverson when he said,""Practice? Your'e talking bout practice? I am an All Star and you are talking about practice?"" That is what I would think about if a teacher emailed me during the summer and is talking to me about doing a project when i should be resting. What's the point of summer if you are just going to be doing school work?      ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
7F697EF803C9,"Some schools today require projects over the summer break to ensure they still remember about the subjects they were taught the previous semester. But should these projects be designed by the student to make the project more enjoyable? Or should they be teacher designed to make sure they meet the criteria needed? Well, students should be given a break during the summer because that is what is is all about and it is a time to relax and enjoy the weather. So I would have to say that students, if required to do the project, should design the summer project. here is why I believe that they should.

Students will be more interested to the project if they got to assign it, because the average student today will most likely forget or just rather enjoy their break. If they were able to design it the way they want to, then they can enjoy project a lot more. There will be some students that still won't do the project, but they were not going to do the project either way weather the student nor' teacher designed the project. But if the student designed the project, then a higher percentage of students will actually do it.

Student designing the project can be a benefit of there own. How can it be a benefit? Well, when the students come together they can explore each others ideas and thoughts about a subject. They can listen to each other and it can be a great way to build on their listing and social skills with the added fact that the can come up with new and brilliant ideas that can be more relevant and unique than a single teacher. Students can also learn more about each other with this exercise and become relatively close with one another.

In lower grade levels such as, second grade to seventh grade, most just get their parents do it. I know about this occurring because in my fourth grade year there were about 32 kids in my classroom, and every project that was assigned to us, every kid had their parents do the project for them. So, kids today havent changed and the project will be irrelevant to them. But if the students make one, then this could limit the project strictly to the student in a way that the parent could not understand the project, therefore unable to do the project for them.

In conclusion, weather the students designed the project or the teacher. Students can have many more benefits than a teacher would. From having a more enjoyable time, to being more effective to the students education. Parents would have to be involved and the student can learn new things without even knowing about it.

I hope this brought a new light to the subject and to influence you to see both sides of the argument.

E024277769DE,"Summer break is the time were students get to unwind relax and just enjoy being youthful with friends and family even though it can lead to them struggling to learn for the next school year. When school is out and students are on summer break students tend to forget everything that they had previously learned from the past year. Which leads them to their first week back to school being confusing also basic concepts that they were already taught become difficult to remember. This is why teachers give out teacher designed summer projects to keep students mentally stimulated, help them get an understanding at the new subject they will be learning, and remind them of old concepts that were taught to them.

If a student is given all of summer break to themselves they won't hesitate to not look at a book or do some practice math problems or watch a video on things they have learned to refresh themselves. Students use the school breaks as a way to hang out with friends and family, get a summer job, and some stay home and do nothing. With all these ways a student can distract themselves and make up open time the summer project will ensure that students minds will have school topics on their mind and stay mentally stimulated through out the summer.

The first week of school can be the most stressful for a student because they have to get used to waking up on time, they dont know were there classes are, and they may not have friends in their new classes. Also students coming back from summer break are introduced to new topics which can be stressful. If teachers give their students coming into their classes a summer break project that the teacher created to help introduce them to the topic they will be learning it will make understanding the subject easier.

In classes that require previous knowledge from lower levels for example math I remember when I went from algebra 1 to algebra 2 it was extremely hard for me to understand algebra 2 because I couldn't use what remembered from the previous level since I had forgotten it over the summer. In this case if I was given a worksheet or some packet that I could have done over the summer to help me remember and use algebra 1 for algebra 2 it would much easier for me to understand what i was being taught. From personal experience I know I wasn't the only other student who struggled from a similar situation like this, reasons like this is why most teachers give out there own assignments for students to do to help them remember old previous concepts and methods from previous years to understand their class.

When compared to teacher designed assignments or projects if students got the choice on what to make their project it would not help them at all because they would do what the minimum of what was required and not put in the same amount of effort as others could have put in. Which is why teacher designed projects over the summer is the better option of the two to make sure students stay mentally stimulated, so they get and understanding of the new subject they will be learning, and it will ensure that they will touch up on old skills taught in previous years that will be need for the following year.             ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
A74CF2F7BC8E,"Over the Summer, students tend to disregard and ignore all things academic. This causes students to forget vital information. This can result in a challenge for students when they return to school after break, because they are expected to remember and build off of previously learned information. In an effort to lessen the amount of information lost, Summer projects are put in place and assigned. The teachers in the school should be in control of creating these projects, and assigning them to students. Teachers have a better understanding of what information is most important to retain, as well as what will be expected of students during the following school year.

When a student forgets information over break, a teacher must spend valuable class time reteaching information students should already know. This makes it difficult for teachers to move on to new information, when students need to back-track to information from the previous year. Then teachers are faced with losing time to focus on new information, causing students to feel overwhelmed when needing to make up for lost time curriculum. Summer projects eliminate this problem, because students will not need a refresher course when they return to school. Having Summer assignments keeps information from fading.

In a students perspective, these projects may not seem ideal, and students may feel as though their break is being compromised by still having work to complete over a break. However what the students don't realize, is that continuing to grow their memory of a subject over the Summer can be greatly beneficial. Teachers should create these projects based on what is believed to be most useful, so students can continue to learn and practice certain information that needs to be retained. Some students may protest these assignments, however keeping information over break is vital. Even though teachers know what was important and what will soon be expected; students know their own individual struggles and where they need to strengthen themselves. However if it were up to students to decide what was assigned and completed, not much would be done. This is because students would rather relax and forget information rather than have to do work over their Summer break. This is a main reason it should be up to teachers what information, and how much, is assigned.

Although students know where they individually struggle, teachers know what information will be incorporated into the expectations of students for the next year. These projects should include information from the previous year, but also provide insight into what students will be learning when they return from break. Students can also brush up on their own problem areas to strengthen themselves, while focusing on what teachers have assigned them.

To conclude this argument, students forgetting information over Summer break is not unheard of. It is extremely common but it is a problem students and teachers everywhere face. Teachers making Summer projects helps eliminate some of the information that fades from students, but also keeps their memory fresh to be able to continue to apply the information. Studying and doing schoolwork over the Summer may seem bothersome and laborious to students, but the results will help students secure information, influencing their academic success positively. Teachers should have the ability to assign Summer projects, but should also consult with students on what they believe would be beneficial to include, involving what the majority of the students need extra help understanding. Summer assignments prevent the hassle of reteaching information, giving students more time to learn and understand new information after their break, in the new school year.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
F955CADBB6B4,"Summer projects should be teacher designed and not student designed. When designing a project over the summer, a teacher's design will be more structured, with a clear goal for the overall project. Also, with teacher's knowing what skills and materiel students need to learn, they will be able to design a proper and well throughout project that will keep the students on their feet. Lastly, when it comes to summer, the last thing on a students mind is school based learning. So, lots of students will either procrastinate or create a poorly designed project leading to no continuation of learning over the break .

Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed and not student.

A teacher is someone who has learned the ins and outs of school based learning, who went to college and received a teaching degree, and has a specialized learning in usually one or more subjects. So when it comes to designing a summer project that's goal is to continue a student's learning during the summer, a teacher is obviously the best fit for the job. For example, if a student who already knows the basics of mechanical engineering and creates a pulley system almost identical to what they did in school, they aren't really learning anything. However, if a teacher who already knows what the student has learned designs a project adding on to what they knew, like creating a vehicle or machine using a pulley system, that would force the student to uses previous knowledge to figure out how to learn something knew.

Since teachers already know what students have learned,they can create a project that will insure further student learning.

Summer for students resembles a break from school. Whether that means traveling to the Bahamas or staying home, a student does not want even the slightest thought of school in their mind. So, if students were given the privilege to design their own projects, chances are they will take the easy way out and design something they already know or even better, procrastinate ,

ending with a rushed and poorly made project. Also studies show that young children and teens have wondering minds making simple decisions harder and causing them to become easily distracted. But, with the guidance of a teacher, students won't have to go through the pain of figuring out their topic and design. A teacher's design will have clear instructions and will prompt further learning. Additionally, teachers will be able to compare students projects allowing an easier grading process and better knowledge of the student's brain.

Some might say that student-designed projects allow a more personalized and creative component. Additionally, students will be able to design a project they enjoy learning. This is true, but not just for student designed projects. Like students, teachers can design different types or styles of projects allowing all types of learning for the student. For example, a teacher can design a project for mechanical engineering, biology, political sciences, Algebra 2, or more, allowing multiple choices for the student to choose. Also no matter what project design a student receives, the topics will be broad, giving space for creative thinking. The teacher-designed projects won't just give students space for creative opportunities but also flexibility with their decision.

When it comes to summer projects, teachers should be the ones designing them. They are specialist in learning and know what further steps students need to take to learn. With the teachers clear design instructions and guidance, it will make summer learning much easier and efficient. Teacher designed projects aren't just helpful for students but teachers as well. When grading or examining the projects, that they designed, it will be easier for them to grade and compare to other students. So when in comes to whether summer projects should be either student-designed or teacher designed, teacher-designed is the way to go and will assure a continuation of learning during the summer break.                ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
08F8BF983C64,"Teacher assigned projects will keep everyone happy,Even though student designed projects are more creative and are the students choice they don't always know or understand what the teacher wants from their project,but when its a teacher designed project the students will have a better idea of what the teacher is looking for and can try to meet all those goals. It also makes the project more structured when the teacher makes it and everyone is expected to have the same type of project. It also makes grading easier for teachers cause they know what to expect.

When a teacher assigns a project they usually list certain requirements that they want in a project. Another project a teacher may assign is a packet with questions they ask the students to complete for the first day of school. With these types of assignments it is easy to know what the teacher is asking you to present for them. in a student designed project they cannot make the requirements very specific cause students may be doing completely opposite topics which make the teachers requirements very vague.

Teacher designed projects are easier on teachers. Grading is easier for teachers when they create it,because they know what they want and in their projects they design they can just look through the students work and check to see if they mention what was wanted in the rubric. Also if its teacher designed then they will most likely be old projects they have done in the past which they would know how to answer any problems that my arise for students while trying to create their work.

Yes even though teacher designed projects are not as creativity promoting as a student project it still does allow students to be creative in how they answer or present cause not every project will be the same while also having key details. Another point student designed project people may choose is that it makes it so that it is easier since its new and the student chose to do this topic the problem with that is the student may have been able to chose the topic but it may not have been a good topic that would've been presented well also if its new every year then the teachers may encounter problems that were not resolved due to the projects being different every year.

So teacher designed projects have more benefits too them then just student designed project. By helping both teachers and students making it easier and more defined for grading.

The relief of not having to study for tests or complete homework for the next three months is pure bliss. Students start to feel the happiness of not having any more work but then the teacher hits them with a summer project and all that joy goes down the drain. Normal summer projects are either twenty page packets, book reports, or essays that must be completed before the next school year. Teachers plan and make the projects and most of them are boring and long. On the other hand, if the students made the summer projects then they could make them to be fun and entertaining. Student-designed summer projects would help assure that the work load would be manageable and would be on subjects the student need more practice with.

Every student has a different agenda over summer break, whether that is traveling for vacation, working at their job, or just hanging out with friends and family they all are doing something. Students know their schedule best so if they were to design their own summer project they would be better fit for making the work load manageable. If students could make their own over the summer assignment, then they could make sure that they would be able to successful complete the project even with their other arrangements that they may have. Some students might have multiple summer projects and their teachers wouldn't know. So if the teacher was designing the project, they might think that the amount of work their giving isn't a lot but once that amount is double or even tripled, depending on how many projects the student was given, then the student would be overwhelmed. Depending on the students' schedules and the number of projects they are being given, a student-designed summer project would be able to accurately determine which amount of work would be best for each of them.

Over the summer assignments are normally very boring and plain, for example, I had a summer project for physics this past summer and it was a fifteen page packet with generic conceptual questions and repetitive math problems. Every time I would continue the packet my eyes would glaze over and I felt as if I was falling asleep. It was extremely boring and I dreaded trying to finish it. If summer projects were student-designed then the students could make them to be more engaging and creative. The teacher's job is to teach and give the correct content so they shouldn't have to worry if the students will enjoy it. However, if the students were to create their own summer project then they wouldn't make it boring because they're the ones who have to complete it.

Summer assignments normally consist of a broad review of the basics for that specific subject. While this might be helpful for the students that easily passed the previous class, this isn't always the case for the rest of the students. For example, my friend had an over the summer assignment for her advanced biology class and the assignment was a packet that briefly reviewed all of the basic subjects. She told me that the packet was mostly easy, but once the course had started she realized that she didn't know anything. She tried reviewing her packet but it was so broad and brief that it didn't help with anything. If that packet had been student planned, then the students could have removed the common knowledge sections and went more in depth about the subjects that they didn't know. Teachers don't know what students fully understand and what they don't, so it would be extremely beneficially to the students if they were to design their own projects. It would allow them to take out the content that they know and focus more on the new or more difficult content so they could be more prepared for their upcoming classes.

Student-designed summer projects would be more beneficial since the students are the ones that know what work load is best and content they need to focus on. It would be extremely hard for the teachers to figure out each and every one of their students' summer plans and what subjects they need to focus on. By having students create their own summer projects, it would be taking away the teachers' struggle to planning a successful summer project and would be more helpful to the students. Summer projects are the foundation for the course it is focusing on, so the students should be the ones who take control and create their own foundation.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9F9FBC5BF6B3,"A student presents their self-designed science project: it is a box of dry ice and a research paper on the properties of the peculiar substance. The project has a valid topic, but it is almost irrelevant to the curriculum of the class. A month later, the student realizes that the summer project should have been some sort of a review of the graphing unit last year---which they had forgotten completely. A summer project is meant to preserve the necessary knowledge from the year before and to prepare the student for the upcoming year. If the project's design includes and practices irrelevant information, then its purpose is completely undermined. In order to avoid this, a summer project should be designed by teachers instead of students because they know the curriculum well, will take it seriously, and can use it as an opportunity to set the expectations for the upcoming school year.

It is most logical and effective for a teacher to design summer projects. As the people who teach the class, teachers are the ones who will know what skills the students must practice in order to succeed in the class.

Therefore, there is no one better fit to prepare the students than the teacher. Only they have the knowledge and expertise to coordinate what the class will require and what the students will be able to give. In Michigan, a student designed a summer project for math, but upon arrival to school, they realize that they focused on the least prevalent and useful topic. It would have been considerably more beneficial to the student if the project were designed according to the curriculum of the class. However, the students simply do not know the curriculum like the teachers do. If they have never taken the class, they would not know what they supposed to focus on for a summer assignment. The teacher, however, would and should be the one to design summer projects.

A student would not treat a summer project with as much seriousness as a teacher would. Through observation, it can be seen that the majority of the teen population does not stay ambitious or dedicated to school during the summer time. Due to this, it makes no sense why teachers would trust students to dedicate their time and effort into designing a well-thought out project instead of dismissing it so that they may enjoy their summer. Teens want to forget about school as summer time comes around, they do not want to spend it preparing for more school. For instance, if a student has the choice between an easy project or a truly helpful, but complicated and tedious project, observation shows that they are most likely to choose the easier option. Teachers should design the project because they would not be as tempted to simplify the project for the sake of their own self desires like students may. In the earlier situation, teachers would most likely choose the harder project because they know it would benefit the students in the long run. Since teachers would be more responsible and serious with the project, they are the ideal designers for it.

A summer project would show students what to expect during the school year if they were designed by teachers. For example, a highly detailed and extensive project would indicate a rigorous class. The projects are an opportunity for teachers to introduce and exemplify the expectations of the students---in this case, high expectations. This sneak peek into class life would hopefully prevent unpreparedness from students and help the class run more smoothly. Teacher-designed projects have also been shown to benefit students by preventing a switch of classes during the school year: a junior at Generic_School decides to switch out of her Spanish 5 class during the summer after attempting the summer assignment. If it were designed by the teacher, it would be just like assignments from the class itself. This demonstrates the advantage of having the opportunity to work on an assignment that mirrors the work done in a possible class: a student essentially gains the ability to do a test run to see if they like it or not. That junior would have gotten stuck in the class and performed poorly if it were not for the summer assignment. Therefore, summer assignments should be designed by teachers to give students an idea of what to expect and what is expected of them.

Teachers are the best fit to design summer assignments for students because, unlike teens with only fun and relaxation on their minds who would not take the project seriously, teachers can create an assignment that will prepare the student for the specified curriculum and demonstrate what they expect from them. This should have tremendous benefits when it comes to student preparedness, class switches, and student success. A student-designed project may sound like a good idea because it opens up the opportunity for students to be creative and show what they know, however, in reality, most students simply will not put enough effort into it. Perhaps if teenagers were more passionate about school during the summer it would work, but until then, teachers remain the best candidate for designing summer assignments.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
0A6BC5C6C8D3,"A summer project can be a great way to keep students actively engaged in their academics while providing them with a way to explore outside interests in their summer life. many schools have adopted this practice and have begun assigning summer projects to students as a way to keep them academically stimulated during their long time off, the big question however is whether teachers should design the project or whether students should instead. The goal of this is to help students to not fall into a summer slum that inevitably effects their performance at the beginning of the school year, which will start them off on a good track to succeed the rest of the year, a common way students fail is simply ""tripping on their own feet"" son to speak, they start off wrong and never quite catch back up. While teacher designed projects can be more well planned for grading and more generalized, student designed projects can arise more creativity, and interest, along with their brains learning more cause of this active stimulation.

With students controlling the project they are free to come up with more creative and well thought project subjects with more thorough research to support it. This is because when a child is given a choice, the drive towards what they are doing is substantially then when the subject is chosen for them, because their minds subconsciously seek control and when this control is given they are more likely to gain sense of tenacity towards the goal. When this tenacity is applied to a choice their minds blossom with ideas and it becomes easier for these ideas to be expressed and put onto a paper or into a presentation that they will soon be able to show their peers. If there is one main thing that drives a teenage mind it is acceptance from peers and those who share a social surrounding, this drive will push them to express themselves to help show off who they are to the people that they want to know, this will also help them to strengthen their confidence is the exploration of new subjects which will greatly improve self performance in other aspects of life.

It is a proven fact that is both children and adults , an elevated interest in a topic directly correlates to success, if the student controls what they study then their interest will increase, ergo so will success. Not to mention the mental stimulation will greatly help the students overall ability to retain information and store what is and isnt useful even if what they a doing the project on isnt directly academic it is academically helping them. In doing these projects they are training their subconscious mind how to retain, store, and apply a topic in which they are researching. when doing these projects the students must actually want to do the work and must want to know more or show what they already do and the best way to do that is given them ""guarded"" control, by ""guarded"" meaning give them control of the subject and content but not so much the requirements. This will provide interest in the subject control of the direction but easily graded work.

In allowing students to decide the topic you are allowing their brains to become willing to be stimulated, the human attention span is a mere 10 minutes. This means in order for students to continue to learn from these projects they must first be greatly interested in what it is the are researching, the brain must be able to cling to the topic so it isnt as easily swayed to a new more ""exciting"" activity like watching TV or playing video games. When a student spends their summer learning alongside the fun they become more willing to learn because then they still have fun whereas many students feel trapped with the day to day felling school cause this is what makes their attention span so short lived.

A student, if given a summer project, should not have to view it as a burden more so an opportunity to express what they know about a subject they love. Students should be the ones to design a summer project so that the end result id more reflective of their mind and not the mind teachers are trying to effect that way teachers and peers have a better understanding of the individuals and they interests. These projects should be given to students with a length requirement but not a subject or material requirement a simple "" give me 3 pages"" and leave the rest to the students.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
7EE10745D09E,"If you ask a student what their favorite season is, chances are they are going to say summer. Summer to children is a time of relaxation and stress-relief from their ten hardworking months of schooling. However, schools often times leave them a project to accomplish over the summer to keep the subjects learned in their mind over the summer. It is for that goal I say that those summer projects should be teacher-designed projects, as opposed to student-designed projects, because teacher-designed projects are better organized, are time-managment friendly, and are easier on the teachers when grading.

When you compare teacher-designed projects to student-designed projects, often times you find the teacher-designed ones to be the better organized. That is due to their adult sense as opposed to a child designed ones. It is pretty obvious if you think about it. Who would you expect to have a cleaner backpack, an adult or a kid? 99% of the time it's going to be the adult. Another reason to this argument is that when a teacher designs the project, It is simple, and it has a rubric, to help clear confusion and what it takes to get the best grade possible. If a child were to design that same thing, going back to when we said an adult organization skills are better than a child, that it will not be as clear and straight forward as a teachers (another reason we will get to soon) because the assortment of ideas behind the project will not be as straight forward and will be more confusing to the grader, leaving you off with a worst grade. With those ideas taken in mind, It appears pretty obvious that the student-designed are not as organized as a teacher

Although adults struggle with the same issue also, I would say all have better time managment skills than a child. That is a main reason why teachers should design projects and not students. Teachers would be able to set specific marks on their project so students don't get stressed out about how to do a huge project spaced out over a very long period of time. When teachers set specific due dates on a project, students tend to get better grades due to this facts. Keeping these issues in mind, summer is a time for relaxation and stress relief, so why shouldn't the students be able to do their projects at their own pace and not be forced to do a project that makes them feel like they are back in school. For that, I say the teacher can also set the due dates to make sure you remember the topics you learned over the summer in a way that a student-designed project cannot simply because of the teachers expertise because she is a teacher that went to school to become a teacher. These reasons taken into account, it's not hard to see that teacher-designed projects are more time-managment friendly than student-designed ones.

The most essential point and the whole purpose of the project is the grading, which, with a teacher-designed project, is easier on the teacher than a student-designed one. One of the key factors to this is that a teacher CAN have a set rubric to her own project, which will make grading go by easier and more accurately. Opposing this, when the project is student-designed, there will be multiple projects, forcing the teacher to spend more time grading them and not as efficiently. With this idea being kept in mind, the more efficient and faster way to grade projects is to have them be teacher-designed as opposed to student-design.

All these topics being brought together, and it shows that the most beneficial way for both teacher and student on a summer project, is to have it be teacher-designed. That way, the student is still feeling stress free, from summer, going into the school year because they have done a better job on that summer project and not fearing getting a scolding from their parents for getting a bad grade for some reason they cannot control, for they are just a child. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
F4E9B4A968FA,"Some creatures understand how to complete a task without the instruction of a mentor; for example, birds know how to construct a nest without being taught how to make one. On the contrary, birds must flap their wings for hours to days under the guidance of their parent in order to fly. The completion of such tasks draws a stark contrast between instinct and the acquisition of skills. Following this train of logic, students should not be designing their own summer projects because they lack the required intuition and experience, which would hinder their educational development.

The phenomena of instinctive behavior allows people to complete tasks without being taught, but this does not provide the student with the tools necessary to grasp what they do not understand. An exquisite example of instinct is seen with the development of verbal communication among toddlers: They are able to understand and speak their first language though only their observations. Why can this logic not be applied to students as well, or rather, why should they not be able allowed to create their own summer projects? Because they are trying to learn something foreign to them within the span of a few summer months, their learning process needs to be accelerated for them to keep up with the curriculum. Understanding the laws that hold the universe together, physics, would take a student years to fully grasp on their own. Therefore, in order to expedite this process, a parent figure with more knowledge and experience, a teacher, should design these summer projects.

Teachers were once students, but students were never teachers. First of all, students do not have the years of experience behind them that teachers had undertaken in order to qualify themselves to teach. Furthermore, these teachers have shared the same struggles that students experience, as they too were once students, so they know how to provide the necessary equipment needed for students to learn. Even if students were to create their own summer projects, they may not understand that each student absorbs information differently, which would imply the consequence that some students may get caught in the undertow of curriculum. The purpose of a teacher is to guide students through the initial continuum of learning, so let them do their job.

Teachers should design summer projects for students because they have the intuition and experience that students lack, and therefore, are able to expedite the educational development of students through the ebb and flow of curriculum. Let the teachers give the students flight so that they themselves may be able to teach another when it is their time to part their knowledge onto the next generation.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
02F4114B1F63,"Summer projects are not exacly favored by students. However, if students got to pick or have a say in their project it would deminish some of the complaints and make the students more intrigued to learn. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be interested and willing to complete the project, it will allow them to work around their summer schedule, and it will make the student feel like they are in control.

If students could pick what project they would be doing and learning about over the summer break it would increase their willingness to complete the project because they would be interested in the topic. Student-designed projects means that the students get to pick the topic that they want to learn about and allows them to create the project entirely. In 6th grade I was assigned a summer project for my reading class where we could pick any book and write two paragraphs summarizing it and make a model decipitating a specific scene from the book. Being able to pick a book that I was excited about reading for this project made it easier and enjoyable for me to complete it. The book I picked was about a wild wolf and in the book it disccussed the wolf's travels and meetings with people. The scene I choose to make a model on was a fighting scene where this wolf protected a human. I was intrigued by the fact that a wolf wanted to protect a human that it didn't know and was not familiar with. This made the project fun to do and made me want to learn more about this topic and read more books like this one. Allowing students to decide and choose what project they will be doing improves the work and interest of wanting to do the project.

A student-designed project would be indivilualized to each student, therefore making sure the student would have enough time to complete it. For most students and families summer is a time to take vacations and spend time with extended families. For instance, my family takes an annual trip down to Northern Florida for a week to celebrate The Fourth of July. Some of my friends go to two week long camps or go away for an extended period of time on vacation or to visit family. The student will be able to design a project that will work with and around their schedule so that they will have enough time to complete the project. If they go away to a camp where they won't have access to technology they can pick to do a project involving a book and bring it to camp or they can choose to do a project about thier camp so they can complete the project at camp. As you can see a student-designed project gives freedom to the student to create and work around their busy schedule to make sure they will be able to complete their project.

If asked to any student about doing a project over the summer they will answer in the same opinionated way, ""I hate summer projects."" However, providing a student-designed project gives the student complete control. The ability to pick what topic they will do and allowing them to design the project gives the power to the student and not the teacher. The teacher will over see the student created rubric and outline for the project but in the end the student gets to decide what they want to do. During the summer kids get a break from school but projects are a constant reminder that school is still there and coming around the corner. Having control over what the project will give the student a sense of control and choice of what they will be learning about. The learning is in the hands of the students and not the teacher. I was able to pick what project I got to do over summer break for my science class, I had the choice of picking anyone in the field of science to study. I could control who and what exactly I got to talk about in the project. Having that control made it easier to accept the fact that I had to do a project over the summer.

Overall, assigning summer projects that are student-designed will positively affect the students and their continued learning over the break. The students will have an increased interest in the project, they will be able to individaulize it to their schedule, and it will give them control. All of these reasons clearly explains the benefits for a student-designed project and how teachers should apply them. In the end grading a project completed by a student who had total control will be expressed in the effort and work put into the project. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
6629A229A900,"Summer is the time of the year every teacher and student look forward to as soon as they start the school year. Many schools in the states require students to complete some sort of task over the summer so that they don't fall behind in the school year. Many of these assignments are usually teacher-designed and students find them boring and useless. I think whatever project or research that schools assign should be student-designed. There are many benefits to student-designed projects such as that the students will actually be passionate about what they learn, they have fun while learning at the same time, and in some cases it can even help them decide what to pursue a career in.

It is no secret that many students just do work because of the grade and don't actually retain any information. If the projects assigned over the summer are student-designed, the students will have a say in what they want to learn about and what they care about. Everyone is passionate about something, and giving students an opportunity to explore those interests may further benefit them in the future. Studying on topics that interests a student and giving them freedom to choose will also help prepare them for the world outside of school. I believe that if the projects are student-designed, many more students will finish the project as well as do it properly. When I was doing a summer project for psych class, I was very interested and passionate about the work I did to research different mental health situations. My passion in psychology led me to finish the assignment long before it was due.

Every child to teenager in America expects nothing less than ice creams and the pool during the summer. When teachers burden them with summer projects, that can dampen their excitement as well as discourage them from completing the tedious assignment. However, if the projects are student-designed, more students will think that it is fun and have fun doing it. It is obvious that if a person gets to choose for themselves rather than have a teacher do it for them they will be much more satisfied and happy while completing the task. While doing my psych project, I had a lot of fun learning about the basic biological facts of psychology, it made me really engaged in what I did.

The grades K-12 are set up to encourage students to enroll in college. Having a student design the tasks and assignments themselves will prepare them for an higher education as well. When having to do everything themselves, students will feel a sense of responsibility and duty towards the project. These small traditions of having student-designed projects over the summer will benefit the student in the far future greatly. Exploring different options might also help students figure out what kind of career path they might want in the future. The summer project I did on my own as well as the psych class over the school year has led me to decide and major in psychology in college.

It is very difficult to make students like work over the summer, but letting them have a say in what to do can make a big difference. There are many benefits as to why student-designed projects are better than teacher-designed. Passion, fun, and future goals are just some of the reasons why student-designed projects should strongly be considered. I think this can be tied into the quote, ""do what you love, and you'll never work a day in your life.""",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9631351EFE3B,"It's true that one of the main concerns that teachers and students share about summer break is the possibility of students being unable to retain all the knowledge they worked hard to learn during the school year. One proposed solution to this issue has been the inclusion of summer projects to a school's curriculum, which would keep students' minds active and learning. The debate that surrounds this proposal, however, is whether or not students should be able to design their own projects. With all the year-round curriculum which is already massively teacher-lead, the most appropriate time to allow students to take creative liberties with their learning should be their summer break, and, by extension, on their summer project.

Students tend to lead pretty similar academic careers. While it's true they're able to somewhat diversify their areas of study in high school, the required classes remain the same, and within them, the information students are required to learn. Summer is the one escape from the rigid and rigorous schedule they otherwise must always follow. It's the best time to allow them to explore their interests, and the assignment itself will impose less on their break if they're able to fill their time with something they're actually engaged in. It grants them freedom while simultaneously fulfilling their academic needs.

It's not only true that allowing students to lead their own projects would be better for their summer liberty, but doing so would also increase the quality of the work they submit overall. The undeniable truth is that students have constant unmitigated access to all the information online they could hope to find; and while pulling from web sources can be a solid way to find information, when a project is heavily reliant on it, the student doesn't have to do much ""learning"" at all. If a student is assigned a topic they can't stand, they're far less likely to invest their time into committing the research to memory. When they have the freedom to pick something they're passionate about, however, there's a greater probability they'll put their effort into producing a paper that they and their teachers can actually be proud of.

Creativity and independence are crucial skills for students to pick up and carry with them throughout their life. Schools may teach a lot of classic skills, like time managment and memorization, but the opportunities for self-discovery and leadership can be limited. Allowing students a chance like this would broaden their horizons and guide them in developing their interests and strengths. Even their potential shortcomings with taking on such an self-supervised project would prepare them for the real world, where they'll have to complete projects on their own frequently.

If students are expected to grow and flourish, they must be given the chance to expand beyond their highly-regulated school environment. When it comes to the issue of summer projects, this means granting them the freedom of expression they need to create truly engaging products. It would provide them with valuable life skills, support them on a path of self-expression, and steer them away from taking the easy way out online. As a plus, it would allow them not to feel as though their one much-needed break is being encroached on. Taking into account all the positive effects of allowing students to lead their own summer projects, it would almost be irresponsible not to grant them the freedom to decide for themselves what they'd like to create for their summer project.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
52052A7BEEE1,"I think this should be a teacher design because, they should challenge students ,and teach us a way to never stop learning no matter where you are.

Some people think that school is hard work and to much , However, its not because no matter where you are you will always need education. Challenging your self is a good thing because putting in hard work and efforts can improve your learning.

I think this would be a great idea because students can learn more things and challenge there selves instead of having fun on the beach, or jumping off buildings.

7429789954ED,"In a lot of schools, students usually have to complete a summer project to continue learning over break. Most of the time, students have to read a certain, designated book and do a handout with it. These summer projects should be student-designed because it can be more enjoyable and creative. Nobody looks forward to wasting their summer working on a school project when the whole point of break is to get away from school and work.

Having students design their own on project makes their minds more creative. It gives them the opportunity to think of cool ideas and to build off of them. Students will be more motivated to do the project if they get to choose the layout of it and design it all by themselves. When teachers give young adults the chance to do their own project, it makes every bodies project more diverse so a lot of people will not have the same ideas or layouts. Student-designed projects give young people more freedom and opens their minds up to the world of new ideas.

Likewise, after having to go to school and doing work on a day-to-day basis, for about ten months, is exhausting. Once students finally get out of school, they feel freedom. Having a whole two and a half to three months of no school, no waking up early, and no assignments, is one of the best feelings ever. The whole point in having a break is to get out and away from school; where all people ever do is work and learn; and getting to relax. Having to complete a teacher-designed project at the end of a break just does not sound exciting or even remotely fun. Some teachers will give an assignment to the class and make it boring and difficult, to the point where students just push it aside until last minute. Every student learns differently. Some will need a more organized and basic project and others may like to create their own and have fun it. Allowing students to design their own projects is reasonable because it can reach a certain learning level that a specific student may need and at their own pace.

Additionally, teachers may disagree with these statements because they want projects that are easier to grade and go over. If a teacher is receiving over one hundred summer projects that were student-designed, he or she may feel overwhelmed and it may take a longer time to grade. All teachers teach differently, just like all students learn differently, so having teacher-designed projects for over the summer can be a simpler task for the teacher. Although teachers want students to learn over break by doing projects, I am sure they want a break too from grading papers and assignments or being flooded with them once school starts back up again.

The end of each school year is the most exciting time for a lot students and teachers because it is finally break time. Having students continue to learn and refresh their memory over the summer should be a student-designed project so they have the chance to thinks of new ideas and be creative, while also completing the given task. Most students learn differently in many diverse ways, so having the option for a student to design their own projects with certain requirements, makes it a lot more motivational for the students and to open their minds to greater extents. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
4C8066726324,"Summer projects can create an opportunity for students to expand their knowledge on a subject and keep their minds sharp. However, for these projects to achieve their intended goal they have to be completed with accuracy and efficiency, as well as have captured the students' interests and provoked thought within them. With this in mind, students should be the ones to choose their topic for a summer project rather than their teachers. A student choosing their own project can allow the student to be more engaged and willing to do the project, eliminates ambiguity within the assignment, and teaches students to be more forward thinking and creative.

Assignments given by teachers will not always reflect the interests of students. In fact, in tailoring to the class as a whole, most if not all of the class will not have particular interest in the topic of choice. By allowing students to choose their topic, these projects can tailor to the students' own thoughts. Most of the time, we will find greater interest in a topic that comes from ourselves rather than from others, especially if it deals with something we enjoy. Therefore, by choosing their own assignments, the students will be willing to complete their projects, and will likely do so with much greater fervor and effort than if the project was teacher assigned.

Sometimes, an assignment can be unclear or confusing. This may lead to a project being completed incorrectly or with more inaccuracies. By having students come up with their own projects, the room for error between the process of the teacher coming up with the project and translating their idea for the students to interpret is eliminated, and replaced with a direct process within only the student. The students will be able to accomplish much more when they know exactly what they are trying to accomplish. Like in a game of telephone, the more people involved in passing on and interpreting an idea, the more muddied and confusing the original idea will become.

A teacher simply telling a student what to do leaves no room for students to grow their abstract thinking and creativity, necessary skills to have later in life. Schooling is meant to prepare students for life, and in the future people will not hand these former-students a list of exactly what to do. Instead, problem-solving skills need to be cultured, and a proper first step is allowing students to choose their own projects. Choosing their own projects allows the students to think a little more creatively in an area of their interest, exploring a topic unique to them. This creative thinking when facilitated in a group of students, can spread to others in similar work and can help grow the education system as a whole.

Although teachers choosing summer projects can be fine for younger children, teenagers should be given the chance to independantly come up with ideas for their summer projects for personal and mental growth. The education system cannot have students expecting to be told how to do everything, as that will not get them anywhere further in life. Creativity is needed to find new ways of approaching old ideas, without it the world woudl stagnate. Ambiguity can only hurt the final product of an idea. Passion is needed for one to put as much effort as possible into completing a task, so the result can be up to standard, or better than expected. By instilling, or removing, these traits/problems early, the school system will not have failed the students themselves. Starting small, even in a summer school project, can end with a massive impact on students' futures.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
C06F12B6FC3F,"Summer can be an issue when it comes to students' abilities of retaining knowledge from the prior school year. Summer assignments are designed to help students sharpen their learning skills over the summer in order to help them thrive in the coming academic school year. One question to consider is whether these summer assignments would be more beneficial if designed by students rather than teachers, or if they should be designed by teachers rather than students. Although some argue that these assignments should be designed by students, teacher-designed assignments would be more beneficial as they would introduce the skills needed to be successful, incorporate curriculum to help students have an understanding of the course before school starts, and ensure that students are correctly preparing themselves for school.

When designing summer assignments, it is important that skills such as reading comprehension, argumentative writing, and creative thinking are reintroduced to help students refresh their memory on how to perform certain tasks to the best of their abilities. Teachers would be able to introduce those skills in the best possible ways, as they are the ones teaching the course and have a better understanding of the skills needed to be successful in the class. If students were to design the summer assignments, their own thoughts on the skills they think they need for the course are not as reliable as the teachers beliefs. Therefore, they would not be enhancing the skills they need for the course, which would make it harder to be successful in the class from the start. Teachers also have much more experience in establishing ways to improve upon these skills. Teacher-designed summer assignments would be the most reliable when it comes to specific ways of introducing skills needed in order to excel because teachers understand the qualities needed to advance in the curriculum.

Also, teacher-designed summer assignments would be the best to ensure that students can obtain prior knowledge of what the course they are going to take will include. Teachers would already have experience on the curriculum and know exactly what to include when designing the task. Students are blind to specific learning standards of the course, therefore, they would not know what to include in order to help them establish background knowledge on the subject. The best way to start off a class is with a general understanding of the purpose of the course and some knowledge on the curriculum. Teachers would be able to include that into the summer assignment to ensure that students can start off the year with a good understanding, which would help them be more likely to succeed. A teacher-designed summer assignment is much more beneficial than a student-designed assignment because teachers would already have examined the curriculum to ensure that students understand the subject before the academic school year begins.

A counter to the prior arguments is that some believe a student-designed summer assignment would be more beneficial than a teacher-designed assignment. If students were able to design their own summer tasks, they would be able to include their own creative aspect to learning and retouching on their skills. Teachers would be able to see the qualities and capabilities of each individual student to help them have an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses. However, although it is good that students can add their own creativity to the task, it does not ensure that students are correctly preparing themselves for the coming year. A student-designed assignment may not include all the necessary learning standards needed for a course such as ways to enhance skills and background knowledge on the curriculum. Therefore, student-designed summer assignments are not even close to the benefits a students would receive from being given a teacher-designed summer assignment.

Teacher-designed summer assignments are best to ensure that students continue learning to the best of their abilities. They would be able to retouch and improve upon certain skills, have a general understanding of the course, and be certain that they are properly preparing themselves for the coming school year. This coming summer, students should rely on a teacher-designed summer assignment to ensure that students can be the best academic scholars they can be in order to have a successful school year. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
31A3040F487C,"Have you ever had a project to do over summer break? well I've never had to do a project over summer break, I personally would prefer for my project to be a student designed cause, you can choose from a variety of ideas, also it would show more creative projects, last it would be different ideas. Well, having a project to do over summer break is a great Idea to keep students brains functioning. If the project is teacher designed all students would have the same topic. I prefer my project to be student designed cause you can choose from a variety of different topics, which you would do your project.

Second, with the project being student designed it would be more creative for students. different students are going to do their projects on different topics, If I had to do this project I would be very creative, And show lots of neatness, Also I would turn my project in on time. Third, with the project being student designed it would be a lot of different ideas students can choose from student would also have time on their projects. Last, having a project over summer break is a good opportunity for students it wouldn't hurt to learn while on break would it? A student designed project wouldn't stop your project it would be more creative, and it would also bring different ideas to the table.    ",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
EECAB3812EEF,"Should teachers or students design summer projects? I would think the answer to this is quite obvious. Teachers should be the ones that design the summer projects. Students are not usually responsible enough to challenge themselves during the school year, much less summer vacation. I can understand wanting to give students a choice in what project they want to complete over the summer, but having them design the project is honestly not a good idea. It would be better if the teacher gave them options as to what project to do instead of having just one assignment for everyone. Students should not design their summer projects because they aren't mature enough yet and they would go easy on themselves.

These days teenagers aren't known for making the best decisions. They go with whatever is more fun for them at the time then what would be beneficial in the long run. For example the vaping epidemic. A large percentage of students have admitted to vaping on/off school grounds, even though they know it's detrimental to their health. It isn't because they don't value their lives or anything like that, but rather it's more fun to vape right now and just face the consequenses later in life. That behavior shows exactly the maturity level this generation is currently at. If you gave them free reign to design their own projects they would most definetely miss the point of why they have summer projects. They would make it really easy on themselves and not retain any of the knowledge that they had accumulated from the past year.

That leads me into my next point, which is that students aren't ready to challenge themselves yet. Very few students have the maturity level to understand the benefits of challenging yourself. They only see summer projects as the worst part of the summer. That's why if you let them design their own projects they would fail to create a good project. You may think that giving them the responsibility to design their own project would make them more mature, but in the end most teens just see it as free points for minimum effort. In college that would be a great plan for sure, but in high school and middle school I don't think so just yet.

In conclusion, students are not at the age to make their own projects because they haven't reached the mental maturity to challenge themselves. In college that would be a great plan to give students an interactive role in their learning, but for right now teachers should definetley take the reigns. They know exactly what we would benefit from learning over the summer, and they know exactly how to prepare us for the upcoming school year. In the future if the students that attend high school and middle school are more mature then by all means go ahead and let them design their own projects that might be a great idea, but until then I don't believe that is the greatest plan right now. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
361958A6AA45,"Most people like to have the opportunity to do things their own way. Students should be allowed to design their own summer projects. Although it may be customary for teachers to design educational programs of this sort, it can allow students to display their creativity and ability to be independent when it comes to their own education. Students designing their own summer projects can get them to be more interested in what they should be learning, which can result in them being more motivated and enthusiastic for the upcoming school year.

Allowing students to design their own summer projects can give them more creative freedom. Some students enjoy making their own study guides and presentations because it allows them to contribute their talents and hobbies to make learning more enjoyable for them. When students have the ability to create something however they want, they are likely to be more determined in doing the task. It also gives students a break from the repetitive styles of teaching they are accustomed to at school.

The responsibility of designing a summer project can help students acknowledge their need to become more independent. If students realize the importance of completing their summer projects on their own, it can give them the push to strive for more by themselves. Some students may be used to getting answers handed to them, but having to do it on their own can inspire a new sense of desire and maturity.

Teachers are more accustomed to creating things like this, so they would have a more knowledge on what is and is not important for a student to be creating and learning by themselves. It could be easier on the students and teachers if teachers assigned an outline on what they expected to be learned by students over summer. However, teachers fail to consider there are alternative ways to learning that help can students compared to how they would expect it to be taught. This will give students the opportunity to explore new ways of learning independently. This can also benefit teachers by seeing where their students are individually and how they can handle projects like this by themselves.

Students designing their own summer projects can improve students love for education. Students will be able to experience a new kind of independence. Furthermore, since students are the ones expected to complete this summer project, it would only be fair if they were allowed to design it in a way that benefits them. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
1A3C75CD285A,"As a high school student, i'd like to have some freedom here at school. Being a student isn't easy, but neither is teaching. Many schools around this area allow students to choose their own summer project. Teachers at my school should allow students to choose their own project, because it gives students some freedom to choose what they want,working at your own pace, and choosing your own style of work. Also, working and taking our time and working on our time will show outstanding results.

When a teacher assigns a project, it feels like death;Especially when there's a set due date. Choosing my own due date allows me and any other high school student to get the resources we need for the project. These resources are working at my own pace, ability to think and figure what i'm doing, and finally having time to finish the work. Having the privilege to set your own due date and work at your own ace and time,will help show the work ethic and credibility of the students work. Not having to rush and stress about a project ,also allows to work flowingly and precisely. Lastly, withholding the option to choose your own due date will show how student based projects are better.

Certain styles and formats aren't for everyone. Some do not suit the worker or they just dont work. I'm not saying for everyone, but choosing my own style will be very beneficial for me. First things first, if I have to do the work, why shouldn't I be able to pick how I want it done. Secondly, I'm not a follower, i'm a trendsetter. Forcing work or something of the sort upon me will show a horrible outcome. Regulating everything i do will drive me insane. Doing something I don't like will tame a lot longer and the work will have very little effort. So clearly, having the option to pick my own way if doing my work will certainly have a wonderful result.

Teacher based projects are even better. Having a skilled and well educated teacher form or reform a students project will result in outstanding grades. Teachers are more educated,has prier knowledge of the topics, and lastly teacher based projects are easier to follow along with. Allowing the teacher to construct the summer projects is very beneficial for students. It gives the students time to prepare, research, and gather all the information they need for their projects. Many students work, waste time, or will never do their work because it's summer time. Although, some students may be responsible , but all aren't and they won't do their work. Furthermore, teacher based projects are better because teachers know what they're teaching and talking about.

In conclusion, student based projects are better and more beneficial for student. They are better and more beneficial because allowing a student to choose the topic , due date, and how it's done will show outstanding grade results and how their work ethic increased over the summer break.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
584A4BB1E954,"Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed ? I think students should designed. students can do this well.

One reason why summer projects from students. Because if the student designed their project they can choose their projects. For example, some students need an essay project but teachers give harder projects for students and they can't do this projects. And some students not have idea about the projects from teachers but when students choose their projects they have good ideas about their projects. However, some teachers did not like to students choose their projects .This is not the only reason summer projects from students is good.

Some may argue summer projects from teachers is good. This is because the teachers have more information about summer projects and they know what kind of projects is better for students. However, some students not have information about summer projects and they did not like to complete the summer projects from teachers in the summer.

In conclusion, I think the students need to choose their projects because if they choose their projects they like the summer projects and they really want to complete their projects in the summer vacation and they have good ideas about the projects.",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
A2979F6CB12B,"Some students, during a break like summer break, can forget a lot of information they have learned throughout the school year. With more schools including the addition of summer projects, this problem can be eliminated. Even so, should the responsibility of the project's design fall on the teacher or the student? Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to have fun and get better grades.

The first reason summer projects should be student-designed is sheer enjoyment. When a student, or anyone, has a break or vacation, they are going to want to enjoy it. Having to to do work on something students are interested in will make it that much easier for students to find time to finish the project in the first place. We all can relate to a time when we were given a piece of work that did not interest us at, but had to do it anyway. These struggles are not things students should be dealing with when on vacation.

Another reason summer projects should be student-designed is the increased chance of getting a better grade. Higher chances of getting a better grade ties in greatly with enjoyment as a cause-and-effect reaction. The reaction is if the students enjoy the projects they design, then they will more likely put effort into their projects and if they put more effort into their projects, then they are more likely get a higher grade. Most students, when receiving a project during a break, are not going to want to do said project which will lead some students to outright skip it. Self-made projects will decrease the chances of this to occur and increase the outcome from this non-occurrence.

Some may argue that teachers designing summer projects will make the content more academic and overall increase the students capacity for remembering information, but this is not the case. The most this will do for students is help them retain the information for the first small part of summer break and not the rest because they would have already stopped doing the project because it lost their interest. A goal for a project during a break should be to retain the most information whilst letting the student get the most out of their break.

In conclusion, the best way to get students engaged in a project is to make it fun. Keeping the project academic while letting the student highlight the best of their own abilities can not only make the student feel better about their own work, but feel good knowing that they are going to do great the following year. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
BF4BD008BA9E,"Schools make summer projects for students to continue their learning, but they can't decide whether they want it to be student-designed or teacher-designed. Student-designed projects would be more beneficial because students would be able to research their interest. Students would be able to use this summer project as a opportunity to find their passions and do some research about them. People might prefer a teacher-designed project, but I believe that student-designed projects would be much more efficient and helpful to students.

A student-designed project is a great idea because it would benefit the students more than teacher-designed one. This project would have students choose their own topic and do some research on said topic. Students would be given the opportunity to explore their interest, unlike with most projects. Students could use a internship or a presentation about their research to show their progress. Students who do an internship would have to present about their experience and prove that they actually did it. At the end of summer, students would present to one of their classes how they documented their experiences and what they learned from this project.

One of the biggest reasons why I think that a student-designed project would be a great idea is that it lets students find their interest. Teens in high school try to find what they are good by participating in extracurricular activities after school. A student-designed project would be the perfect opportunity to find interests. Students would be given some time before school ends to think about the topic they want to research. Summer would be used to research their topic and document their experience. This project could help students get an idea of what they want to study in college thanks to this Student-designed project, which allows students to find their interest/passions and research them. This kind of project has the possibility to help a lot of students find their passion or at least figure out their options.

People wouldn't like the idea of a student-designed project because students can't consult or get help from a teacher if they run into a problem. I believe that this wouldn't be the case because the whole reason behind a student-designed project is that every project will be different and unique to that student. Students wouldn't need help because the project would be about them, unlike a teacher-designed one.

the beauty of a student-designed project would be the originality of each one of the projects that is the reason why students don't need help on this kind of project, other than directions for it. A teacher-designed project doesn't really help a student at all because its just another project they have to do to keep their grades up.

In conclusion, a summer project would be best if it was a student-designed one. A student-designed project allows student to find their interests/passions and allows them to explore different interests. People might prefer a teacher-designed project, but I believe that student-designed projects would be much more efficient and helpful to students. A student-designed project is unique to every student and I believe it can impact a student career's choice.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
EC9BB8FF0638,"Although teacher-designed projects are much easier to maintain in grading terms, student-designed projects are ultimately more likable. By allowing students to create their own projects allows them to learn in a way they prefer and improves grades. Students who chose this will also get the benefit of researching what they enjoy and makes them more motivated to complete the project.

Being able to have choice in what students can make for their Summer project is better for their grades. Overall, students preference for what they choose to educate themselves in tends to make them excell in that topic. Studies have shown for years that students who are forced to complete projects by the teachers expectations fail considerably more than students who are able to choose.

By allowing students to choose this rout, their grades would increase.

Keeping students more motivated in their work is a key factor to getting things done. Topics that a student is interested in improves speed and quality to a great extent. Several schools were tested for this and research shows that the school with the option for students to create their own project got their projects done five times faster than the other schools who did not. These students highly appreciated and loved the work they made for the fact that it was hand picked by themselves.

Although, Some students may enjoy their choice and design of projects, some teachers may not. Students who lack creativity could possibly be lazy to the oppertunity of a self designed project, which makes it very hard for a teacher to be able to grade. Teachers cannot measure a grade for some lazy students for choosing something easy, this making the grading process even worse.

Nonetheless, Student-designed projects generally are better. Making a student-designed project continues to allow students to learn better at their own pace. By doing this increases speed and quality of work. A choice in what they get to learn outweights the bad apples of the student body. Giving a students the choice to make a Student-designed project would change how schools opperated in a whole new way. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
4EFC8F589A83,"Knowledge, it is one of the most powerful things in the world. How do people gain knowledge? They gain information from their mentors, teachers, coaches, parents, and older siblings. People are always learning something new everyday, from how to do long division to how to make friends. The school districts are creating projects for students to do over the summer so they can continue to learn while out of school. Although some say that teacher-design is better and more effective, student-design actually can benefit the students more by opening up their imagination and also expands their creativity.

Summer is mean't for fun and laughter, not being kept inside all day working on a project the teacher assigned over summer break. The whole point of summer is being away from school and having a vacation. So wouldn't students prefer to do a project about something that they are passionate about? Indeed, studies show that when students do school work that they choose and are passionate about their work ends up being more creative and overall better performance. Students are just growing up and in school they aren't allowed to truly express themselves because they are either too shy or the class doesn't discuss their interests. Teenagers only want to do and listen to what they want, they don't want a teacher giving them homework over summer break not even to mention that it is not something they enjoy. Creating a summer project that the students can create on their own with their brilliant minds will not only increase there productivity level, but also make them love school more because they get to do something that inspires them.

However, students grow up doing what they are told by their parents and teachers. Having a teacher planned project can be very beneficial because students more times than not, when doing something they don't like, they end up getting offtask or going the easy way out. That is why they need to have structure and guidelines. What ends up happening is when a student is struggling they procrastinate or end up not doing it at all. This branches from when students have difficulty coming up with their own ideas and are stuck trying to figure out what to do. That is why having a teacher based project is more effective because students are given what they need all they have to do is complete the assignment.

In conclusion, students grow up with an endless imagination and one day eventually it dies when they grow up to become adults. That is why a student-design project can end up being more beneficial than supposed to having a teacher assign the students a project where they aren't going to have fun and in the end will probably forget what the project was about. Students learn better when they do something that interests them and benefit more from that then to do a project about the presidents.

Having a teacher-design project has minimal benefits, that is why having a student-design project, which opens up great minds and can help students comprehend better what they are learning when doing something they enjoy.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
6C842D6D66A0,"Summer projects can allow students to focus on something, school related, while on summer break. Which is good because it keeps the school juices flowing in their brain and it gives the student something to do rather than staying at home doing nothing. When the students are at home during their summer break, most of what they learn during the school year is out the door, in about a month. Summer projects can be a bit too much when they are assigned by a teacher rather than the actual student. Summer projects should be designed by the students rather than the teacher because it allows the students to express their own ideas more and the students can be more interested/enthusiastic about the project.

To begin with, students should design their own summer project because it allows the students to express their own ideas more. For example, an 11 year old boy loves to draw, paint, and write and doesn't really get to show his talents off in school because he is afraid his friends won't treat him the same the way. His school always assigns each student to create their own project during the summer. When its the last day of school hits he gets excited and anxious because he knows he can be able to start thinking about his summer project. His creative ideas start to flow in as soon as he is released from school. He starts to write down his ideas that he thinks would be good to do during the summer break. His idea is to make a huge painting of his school and decides to write a poem to go along with it. It's the first day of school and he comes to school with his project ready to show it off to his new teacher. His teacher starts to cry because she had never seen such art before and how beautiful his poem was. She gives him a 100 on his project as she wipes her face off and tells him he should go put that in an art museum because it had looked like a professional artist had did his project. This example shows why it is important to have students create their own projects. Students can end up being as good as anybody they put their mind too when it comes to creating their own ideas. Without them being able to express their own ideas, people won't be able to see how creative their child can actual be. Students should design their own project because it allows the students to express their own ideas more.

Primarily, students should design their own project because the student can be more interested/enthusiastic about the project. For example, a student is assigned a summer project by the teacher at the end of school. The student goes online to see what the project is about. The student is anxious because they havent done a good project in a while. They read about what they have to do and ends up not liking the project at all. The student isn't interested and knows they are going to get a bad grade on it because the student doesn't do well on any projects they get assigned to them that the student doesn't like. It's almost the beginning of school and the student turns the project in and gets a C on it. The student know's that if they were able to create their own project that they would have gotten a way better grade on it. This shows that if the student was to create their own project that they would have been interested in it and would have gotten a better grade on it. Students being able to create their own summer projects gives them more space to create and think about ideas on their own without someone else creating an idea for them. Students should design their own projects because it can allow the students to be more interested/enthusiastic about the project.

To conclude summer projects should be designed by the students rather than the teacher because it allows the students to express their own ideas more and the students can be more interested/enthusiastic about the project. Students being able to create their own project gives them some kind of responsibility and ownership of their project. Without that students won't be able to express that kind of ownership until they get out of house or in high school. However, if students are able to create their own project they can make the project easy, therefore they wouldn't have to work as hard as they would, if someone created the project for them. Allowing the students to create their own projects can be risky, but it gives them that responsibility and ownership that they might need.           ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
49D96425D334,"Over the summer, students typically take a step back from schoolwork to relax, socialize, and have fun independent of school-related responsibilities. It is important to unwind but also not to forget the skills and information learned over the school year. As a result, schools assign summer work and projects in order to make sure that their kids continue to learn throughout the break. These projects should be teacher-designed in order to make sure that students do the right amount of work and critical thinking, but at the same time engage with what interests them.

A project that is designed by teachers forces students to do an amount and type of work that helps them keep learning. Many kids loathe summer work. If presented with a project that they must design themselves, there is a significant group who will not put their full effort into the task and produce a subpar final product. Not only will they have an unsatisfactory amount of work, but they will also not benefit from the brain activity that the project was designed to promote. Without structure and direction from a teacher, students can easily fall short of what is expected. Summer assignments fail in their intended purpose if students do not produce the quantity of work that benefits them, thus teacher direction is a logical way to create accountability and motivation.

Lack of quality is equally, if not more damaging than lack of quantity. Summer projects are assigned in order to keep students learning and engaging with new ideas and concepts, and critical thinking is particularly absent during the summer. Summer assignments seek to remedy that. A teacher may, for example, push a student to make connections that they would not make otherwise through the format of a project they assign. Summer projects also seek to reinforce information or processes learned during the school year, something which might not happen if the project assigned is student-designed. In many cases, a lack of critical thinking is not necessarily a result of laziness so much as lack of information and direction. Unless a teacher designs a project that has a student complete a specific task, students can miss out on the skills and information that their teacher wants to impart and reinforce.

The counter-argument is that with a teacher-led project, students lose the interest and fun factor that comes with fully independent learning. However, individual, exploratory projects can be open-ended and still teacher-designed. The freedom to create a project around a topic of interest is important, especially during the summer, and still achievable within the framework of a teacher's guidelines. The guidelines are only there to encourage the kind of thinking and learning that the schools intend.

Summer projects must be designed by teachers in order for students to do the quantity and quality of work that will help them stay smart over the summer, while still enjoying typical summertime freedom. A teacher's guidance helps create accountability and motivation to produce the right amount of work and encourage critical thinking, and teacher-designed projects do not have to mean a lack of fun. But above all, the risk of a summer spent without learning greatly outshadows the annoyance of a summer project where a teacher sets the ground rules.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
7B74A22F8230,"Students, during breaks over long periods of time, can cause ineffectiveness in their ability to remember the subjects they have learned during the school year. Therefore the idea to require students to complete a summer project to assure they continue to learn over the break is a great solution to improve this growing problem. The proposal is divided between if the projects should be student or teacher based. The projects during the summer break should be student based projects because they will learn to become more creative, they will achieve a new level in responsibility, and they will give students the ability to maintain the knowledge given to them better.

Student based projects during the break over summer would be more beneficial then teacher based projects because it gives student the opportunity to become more creative. For example, if there was a student who had to come up with an idea for the summer project and had no starting off point of where to begin, this will inspire that student to become creative and think of a project to do over the break. The ability for a student to be creative will help them in the future to create solutions for difficult problems. Teacher based projects will only limit their creative thinking to what their teacher come up with. Also, the creativity in one student can inspire another to do very creative things as well. Perhaps, that student could inspire another student also to be creative. By doing that it will create a chain reaction leading to new creative thinkers for the future. Creativity is more beneficial in student based projects then teacher based ones.

Responsibility will improve those who used student based project opposed to teacher based projects over the break. The increased habit for students to be responsible will improve their maturity for their future. Students will sooner be prepared for a new level of responsibility in college. This will also prepare them for future job positions as well. Further more, the students with this new level of responsibility will have a better tendency to turn in their work on time due to the student based projects other than the teacher based projects. Student who do not turn in papers on time will likely improve on this habit. Responsible students will be even more so once they have done their project over the break. Students who use the student based projects will make them more responsible than others who use the teacher based project.

Finally, the ability to maintain the knowledge will improve if they use the project based by students not by teachers. Students who make their own projects will memorize them better because the student made the project themselves instead of a teacher. They spend more time coming up with the project; by doing this, the student will obtain the information given to them better. Students spend this time researching projects that interest them which will make the project more memorable to that student opposed to a project given to them by a teacher. The ability to maintain the knowledge will also improve when students do this over a long period of time. Students are given a long period of time because this project is going on during summer break. Some students will spend a lot of time researching the subject of the project which will help maintain their knowledge better then short term projects. Student based projects will improve the ability to maintain the knowledge better than teacher based projects.

In conclusion, the projects during the summer break should be student based projects because they will learn to become more creative, they will achieve a new level in responsibility, and they will give students the ability to maintain the knowledge given to them better. The better students are with maintain knowledge over long periods of time the better their lives will be in the future. The future will be changed by those students they should be taught how to lead the future responsibly. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
D6F76B0E487F,"Teachers should be the ones to designed summer projects because, they are more experienced at giving out projects and homework based assingments then students. A teacher can explain things way better than students can, and will help you out if you got questions. They can hand you out a list of the things that are required to do the summer project, or a rubric paper. Most students would prefer to design the project themselves, but it would not benefit them because it makes it easy on themselves, therefore they aren't learning anything. It would be easy for them and some students wouldn't do it because it's summer time.

I don't like the idea that students should be doing summer work because its our break time. Schools should take in consideration, that students spent a whole year doing loads of work and learning. Nobody wants to be doing work over the summer, so if a student makes a project for the whole school students would be less likely to do it. Student have a better understanding of the work if a teacher did it then another student making the project. Also not every student can agree with another student because some students don't have any creativity, where as if a teacher did everyone can agree.

I don't like the idea of some schools only worrying about us learning, that they decide to give us work during our summer time. Some parents wouldn't like the idea of summer work because, some families travel or go on vacation for the summer. Not every student has the same capability to make a summer project. First some teachers wouldn't be able to understand every kids individual work, where as if a teacher assinged the project she would understand because everyone has the same project. We are all human beings, we all breath the same air, and we all feel the same way about doing work during the summer.

Schools think that we become lazy over the summer and that we forget about what they tough us when we were still in school. Life isn't just about doing school work all the time, we should be able to enjoy it and not have to worry about education all the time. We spend part of our life in school and when we try to have fun, they still want their students to always worry about it. Lastly I don't think teachers want to always be grading projects.

In Conclusion Teachers should be the ones to make the work that way everyone kows what their doing. The teacher can hand out a rubric about what the project is based on. Students would agree to do it more because, someone with experience made it and would be mandatory for them to do it. All and all students don't have enough experience and patients to make a project for everyone. If the project is worth a lot of points then they are also most likely to do it aswell because, it can impact their next year grade.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
A020F9D9B47C,"In modern day schools, students are focused on things such as technology more than classwork. Schools across America have adapted to this very quickly and now a lot of class work is done on computers and cellular devices. This advancement has been very beneficial to students and teachers, but because of technology students have begun to lose information faster than ever. Some teachers have even begun to assign projects over the summer time. Students have become very upset that they have to complete school assignments over the summer, therefore some have suggested to let students design these summer projects. It would'nt work out as many would think. Teachers should design summer projects because it will be more educational, better organized, and it will be retained better by students.

Teachers should create these summer projects because it would be more educational. Teachers jobs are to help students gain more knowledge and learn new things. Students just aren't capable of creating a project that helps them retain information over the summer. Even if students were to design the project it would hinder the accuracy of the information there for making it less helpful for them. Teachers could make it more accurate and efficient in helping them keep the information they learned before summer.

Also teachers should design these projects because it will be better organized. Some students aren't even capable of keeping their own room organized so why should school staff let them create an assignment for the summer. Though some teachers may not be the most organized they get the job done. Teachers have a tendency to keep things clean and neat due to them having to know where all of their papers and supplies are. Therefore, students should not design these papers because they are not organized.

Finally, the information they learn from these projects will be retained by students if teachers design them. Over the summer, students would much rather use their cell phones and go to social events than complete a project that helps them retain information over the summer. So, students would most likely design this project to be easy so they can finish it quickly and afterwards do anything they want over the summer. Though teachers could look over these projects and make sure they are educational, it would be much less of a hassle to just let teachers deign it instead of students. After students complete exams and essays at the end of a school they're most likely tired from the whole year full of work they just completed. Yes, it may be stressful but it is very important that students are able to keep this information.

In conclusion, teachers should design summer projects because it will be more educational, better organized, and it will be retained better by students. As shown, students are just not cut to design these assignments. Teachers should design them because it will be more beneficial for students. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
2FEBCE09CF3C,"In many schools in Virginia there are summer assignments. These assignments are for students to continue learning year round. Teachers design these assignments so that students are prepared for the curriculum, it is easier to grade, and structure is applied.

Teachers know what is expected in classes before the students. So if the teacher creates the projects then students will have prepared prior knowledge. Such as a student is going to take a new math class the next year. The teacher expects that student to have formulas memorized but the student does not know that until they are already behind in the class. If they are given projects to find and research this prior knowledge they will be prepared for that math class. If no context is given to a person how will they answer the question? They will answer with more questions.

When a teacher makes an assignment they know exactly what they want. The student may infer close to what the teacher expects. This leaves little room for interpretation on the students part. While if a student is only given a large subject area to create a project over the summer they are left to create anything they feel fits in the subject. The teacher has to make sure the rubric is broad enough to accept most projects but detailed enough to put a real grade to it. The teacher will then have to work harder to grade and understand how the project fits in the subject. They, depending on the size of the classes, could have hundreds of projects to grade and interpret.

Structure is always needed to keep a student on track. A clear rubric allows for a student to know exactly how they will be graded. If a student is left to interpret something they will also have a very broad rubric. The rubric will be written by the teacher who is grading it. This means even if the student creates the project the teacher still put parameters on the student leading it back to being a teacher made project. There would be no reason to create the project if there is no grading system. This would slowly tear down the structure of the school system. This failing of structure would leave students to have to teach themselves and they would become uninterested and not learn anything.

Teacher led assignments give a path to preparation, grading, and structure. Without easier grading methods the teachers will even more over worked. Without prior knowledge to the class students will fail even more. Without structure within assignments schools would become anarchies. In the end, teacher created projects allow for less stress on both parties. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
29C9EF546659,"Summer Learning

Summer break was created to let students have fun and freedom. It's a time for students to relax and enjoy their youth with friends and families. However, when students come back into school they forget the material they learned last year. Some schools require summer projects so students can continue learning and obtain the knowledge. While some may believe letting students designed their projects gives them freedom with it, others may believe letting teachers design the project because the project would be based more on educational topics and have a set of guidelines to help the student.

Having the summer project teacher-designed gives the teacher the choice of educational topics for the project. Depending on the teacher, it can be on math, science, english, history, or any other subject that the student takes in school. This helps the student continue their learning from the previous year and keeps the topic school appropriate. The main point of schools doing this summer project is to further the learning of the student. While some people believe it's taking the freedom of choosing a topic, a student can chose anything which doesn't improve their learning. If a student chooses skateboarding, video games, sports, or food it defeats the purpose of the summer project. The teacher, however, can give many different topics to chose from which allows some freedom to the student. They can pick a topic that seems interesting, but also continues their learning for the school year that is coming ahead. Also, by letting teachers pick the topics that can be picked by the students, the students can teach the kids in the class about the learning they have learned. This gives other kids the opportunity to hear new educational topics and gives the teacher only to review over that unit. Having teachers base the topics more educational benefits the students, but as well as the teachers.

Another reason why the summer project should be teacher-designed is so they can create a set of guidelines to guide the student. The teacher can provide a rubric and rules to help the student understand what needs to be done for this project. For example, if the project needs to be a poster, tri-fold, or PowerPoint. Another aspect is if students can work in groups, duos, trios, or by themselves. Moreover, if the student needs to include any pictures, drawings, or symbols. Having guidelines helps the students be organized with their work and keeps them responsible of doing the work. If the student had designed this project they could've been confused and lost on what needed to be done. Students could've also forgotten about the project and not be prepared for the first day of school. With having this guideline, teachers can leave their email so the student can have access to help if needed. Furthermore, the teacher can leave websites and databases that help provide the student with resources for this project. These sets of guidelines can also included the choices of all the topics. This keeps the teacher informed of what students might do and what the teacher should prepare for on the first day of school. Overall, having a guideline created supports the student and keeps the teacher organized for the upcoming year.

Although creating the summer project teacher-designed takes the freedom of choice from the students, the teacher-design allows for the topics to be educational and for the teachers to create a set of guidelines to support the students. The summer project is to help keep students continue learning during their break. Teacher-design keeps that idea in place, while students can mess around with it. It is a teachers job to teach and provide guidance and not for the students to teach themselves and stress themselves out. Teacher-design is the right way to go for the summer project.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
F4F75FAEAFD6,"When I first read this prompt my first thought was, why would any student ever want work over break? Students go to school Monday through Friday for 8 hours a day, summer for teenagers is suppose to be kids having fun, getting a job to maybe achieving some goals, maybe making some money. It's also suppose to be a time for no stressing, and just focusing on being happy, and most school projects cause a good amount of stress for most students. But if I had to pick between students designing it or the teacher designing it, I would pick the students designing my project.

If students designed the project they would be more likely to design a project they might actually want to do, and spend their time on, so maybe when they finish their project they can have time for other things. Students would also be able to pick a project they would have fun doing over the summer, not every school project has to be miserable. Students would also be able to pick how much work they'd want to do and what kind of project they would be willing to do. If they have too much work, or a project they don't like doing most students would probably procrastinate on finishing it and put their work off till last minute, then the project would be rushed and sloppy.

If teachers designed their project then they would probably have more work than they wanted, and also a harder project to do, and something the students would probably have no fun doing at all. One positive thing, if teachers did design the project, would be the fact it would be really well constructed and put together. If the students designed the entire project it would probably be a little confusing for them and not put together as well, as if the teachers did it. That wouldn't be good on any ones part, the teachers would hate grading the project and the students would achieve a bad grade.

It seems that they're many pros and cons for both sides, the students and the teachers, determining on who shall design the project and what the pros and cons are, are just personal opinions. Your opinion is determined on your personal experience, and the teachers and students you've been around. How the teacher is and how the students are determine who should design the project, everyone is different.

In conclusion, I think students designing the project would be better, especially if they put in hard work and effort, I think most students would rather have fun with the project and decide what they want to do on their own rather than having a teacher design it and pick everything students have to do. Most students would probably be miserable doing it then, or procrastinate and not do anything at all. But nobody can do anything if they don't put their mind to it.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
5E9118C7949A,"During the summer many students tend to loose the skills and information they gather through the previous school year. Some higher level courses to prevent this problem, implement summer reading activities or online module/guided programs to keep their students on top of the material or to refresh them... but with all schools come different teaching styles. Some teachers strive for their students to be more independent and do the work on their own, but other teachers like to have a rigorous and set rubric or outline of what projects and essays should look like. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it eliminates the loopholes that can be found by the students, the teacher can incorporate the summer project into a future theme or unit in the school year, and if students designed a project for themselves they wouldn't challenge themselves and put minimal effort in.

Students when they are given freedom or multiple options tend to tweak and stretch the guidelines to make it easier or to even make excuses on why they didn't do a certain part or do it a certain way. If teachers have full control over the design of this summer based assignment they can insure the students will do what they say exactly and theres no if's, and's, or but's about it. Also when the teacher has full control over the summer assignments design it is easier for them to fi the project's theme into the curriculum or unit they desire during the school year. With my AP English teacher this year, 11th grade, I had summer reading to do and an assignment she attached with it. This book ended up tying into other books we discussed in class and fit into the curriculum very well. This shows how it benefits the teachers a lot with workload, and even students, because the assignment actually means something and isn't just a bogus last minute project they could make up and waste their time.

The last example of why a teacher-designed project is beneficial to the students is that it doesn't sell the kids short of their academic potential by just taking the easy way out with an easy project. Students, or anyone, only grow and develop when they're exposed to challenges and obstacles it builds their mental capacity and their problem solving skills. If a teacher choices to do a particularly hard project or assignment this pushes the students out of their comfort zone allowing them to make these new connections in their brain and gain new knowledge and working skills. But if a kid is allowed to design their own project for the summer, most kids aren't going to do an extravagant or hard project, but instead take a more simplistic and easier way because the students want to enjoy their summer and not waste it on a school project. This would be a detriment to the students academics and the skills they could've acquired if they were to apply themselves.

The opposing idea of a student-designed project can be argued to be beneficial to the students for maybe 2 ways, it allows the student to be more creative and if they can design something they like... they will be more motivated to complete the task. Though these are both good ideas. They don't hold as many pros as the teacher-designed project does. Teachers often add a lot of creativity to their projects and even have a rubric section for maybe 5-10 points just for creativity and colorfulness itself. Teachers also often allow kids to atleast pick the topic of the project or what they want to research to encourage them to do something they like, but still hold the same guidelines for the attatched project.

Though sometimes these projects the teachers provide seem tedious, pointless, and ""too much"" the teachers are usually doing it for the students own good and want to see them grow as a student. These teacher-designed assignments allow them to help students through the school year, guide them through lessons, and develop them as a student. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9620EB00A5C5,"What student enjoys seeing that link on the school website saying, ""Summer assignments""? Most students hate the idea of having to do a math packet or write a paper over the summer. Students, especially high school students want a break from all the grueling homework that they have to do throughout the school year, so the idea of a break sounds nice to them. If the idea of summer homework was up to students, most of them wouldn't do it. If students were to design summer homework, it would be the easiest assignments out there. There wouldn't be essays or math packets to do, instead there might be maybe 20 math problems and a book to read. Students deal with a lot of stress during the school year, so adding more homework and projects to do over the summer adds to what they're already dealing with. Summer is supposed to be a time of relaxation, getting away from school, if kids were in charge of those summer projects, there wouldn't be any.

That is why if there is going to be summer assignments, it needs to be teacher-designed.

A teacher-designed project or assignment is to help the student retain their knowledge of the previous year throughout the summer, so that they will be prepared for next year. Teachers are able to see the skills and struggles of students and they can base the project off of those areas. Most students will have about 3-4 summer assignments that could possibly be done in two weeks, but most wait until the last few days or weeks of summer to do them. Why? Kids want to be able to enjoy their summer without thinking about homework or school. A few weekends ago, I had a youth retreat to the mountains, I didn't think about school once that weekend and it was probably the most fun I'd had all school year. School is like bondage to students. They're forced to do homework, projects, and standardized tests. That's why they appreciate their time off from it all. If teachers don't take the initiative on summer assignments, students won't work on any schooling all summer long. Let's be real, as a teacher, would you do summer homework if your teacher didn't give you any?

Today's generation is known as the ""Lost Generation"", they deal with the stresses of social media, body image, and on top of that, school. Even though they deal with those things, schooling is still very important to every individual. Teachers need to make sure that their students are maintaining previous learned information so that they can succeed in the next school year. Students who are dealing with stress and anxiety would most likely not do the summer projects so that they can have a break. Most adults know that when leaving things up to children, they will either most likely not do what they're told or they would try to find the easiest way out of it. Allowing summer projects to be student led would be the dumbest idea ever. They would find easy ways to escape the project or they wouldn't come up with one in order to escape the stress that it brings with it.

While some may say that student-designed summer projects will allow them to use different brain muscles then they normally use during the school year. I would argue that as a student, most high school kids I know, if given the opportunity, would make it the easiest project ever. Kids today don't want extra work. They will take every chance they can so that they don't have to go to class or don't have to turn in their homework. For example, earlier this year my mom sent a note with me to school saying that I was to leave early because we were going to Generic_City for an event. Later that morning, my mom learned that we weren't able to go, but I still had my note to leave early. Normally I would've had to stay in school, but I pleaded with my mom so that I could leave early, because I wanted to get out of the rest of the day. The moral of the story is that kids today, especially towards the end of the school year don't want to do school work at all. Another example of this would be ""Senioritis"" where seniors just stop doing there work because it doesn't matter to them anymore. Even though student-designed projects do work another part of people's brains, kids would take the idea as a joke and would make the summer project very easy.

Teachers often know what's best for each individual student. When they give students homework it's often for their benefit. That's why, teacher-designed summer projects would be better than student-designed projects. Particularly because students wouldn't take the project seriously. If a project is for a grade, most students would take the assignemnt seiously. If the assignment is for extra credit or just practice but won't be a grade, then they probably woudln't do it. Students respect teacher's assignments if given, but if I were to give another student a summer assignment, they would luagh at me. Why? 1. They could care less if a student gave them an assignment and 2. they want the summer off. That's why a student-designed project wouldn't be successful to today's age.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
3513A3F9728F,"Many schools and classes required students to complete summer projects. These projects are generally meant to introduce a subject or refresh the students memory in a subject area. Since these projects are teacher-designed, many of them fail to achieve the purpose which they are meant for and instead just become another tedious task on a kids to do list. Students should be able to design their own summer projects in order to prevent cheating, encourage creativity, and so the students can be more engaged in their project.

One big problem with summer assignments is that they are easy to cheat on. This is a problem because if a student cheats on a summer project, he or she will fail to get what they were supposed to learn from that project. A good example of kids cheating is a summer math packet. Many apps such as mathway and photomath can be used to take a picture of the problem and get the correct answer with all the steps. Students could also just simply find all the right answers online or consult with another student to get the answers. Student designed projects could eliminate the possibility for cheating by making students each produce their own unique project. A good example of a student-designed project that would eliminate cheating is a math teacher asking his or her students to design their own math problems. When the students submitted their problems the teacher could then easily compare one students work to the other students and also to students on the internet. Students could also cheat on other assignments, such as reading a summer book, by just using the internet to look up a summary. Therefore, instead of making students read, the teacher could assign a short essay on any topic, helping students practice writing. Overall, student-designed projects are just harder to cheat on because they require that the student produces his or her own unique project. This can ensure the teacher that the student is actually learning what they need to rather than getting answers from a computer screen.

The second reason that summer projects should be student-designed is that it would encourage creativity. Rather than doing mindless busywork, students would be encouraged to think outside the box and conduct their own project however they see fit. This would make students more likely to complete their summer projects and more likely to actually learn their info because they would have to apply it in order to design a project. A good way to think about this is with science projects. Throughout most students school careers many have to complete a science project. These projects require that students design their own projects that will later be presented in a competition. Unlike normal school events, science fairs like this inspire tons of creativity and even draw in attention with the outside world. Many gifted kids experiment with vaccines, robotics, and even engineering. This application of skill and creativity is able to show the teacher what a student is like, which then helps the teacher understand the student better moving forward. It can also help the student better show the teacher what he or she is capable of and how smart they are. Projects being student designed would also minimize the burden of a teacher to grade the projects. All of the projects would be unique and present new viewpoints on the topic at hand, some of which the teacher might not even know. Also if students make their own unique project they would most likely receive full credit since the only standards they have to achieve is the ones they themselves set. The teachers could simply grade based off of creativity and whether or not the student completed the assignment.

The final reason that a student-designed project is better than a teacher designed one, is that a project which is designed by a student would be more engaging than a teacher assigned one. One example is summer reading. Most of the time teachers assign one book or an extremely limited variety of choices for the student to read over the summer. Many students tend to be extremely bored reading these books or just simply look up a summary and remember it. Instead of doing this students could instead let students pick out their own book, so long as it is a certain topic and/or in a certain genre. If the students were to pick there own books they would be far more likely to actually read the book and be engaged with it. If they enjoyed the book more and actually read it, then they would be more adept in assignments and discussions relating to the book that they read. Another good example of student-designed project is once again the science fair. Science fair projects are basically just student-designed science labs. The difference is that when a student is doing their science fair projects, they are generally far more interested and willing to put more work into their project. There is also another benefit to a project being more engaging to a student. If a project that a student completes is memorable and engaging, a student will be far more likely to remember that info moving forward. This would help the student have a better base of knowledge and perform better in the class that the project was assigned. By designing their own projects students would simply be more interested and more committed to learning over the summer than if they completed a teacher-designed project.

Overall, the benefits of student-designed summer projects are enormous. Giving creative direction to a student is crucial to making sure they retain information during a long break like summer. Students would be far more engaged and motivated to complete a project that fulfills their specific desires and interests relating to a topic rather than do just another summer packet. They would also show far more creative integrity and creativity compared to a normal project. Schools across the nation should integrate student-designed projects into their curriculum.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
7AE4C8D9B286,"My grandpa once said to me that school is a way to broaden one's horizon; it's not just a way to learn and get through the school years. Throughout one's schooling one is exposed to many different topics, this effects what they choose as a career and or the path they take later on in life. Certain topics sparks one's interest when in school, this may lead to one becoming more involved. The students know what interest them and what doesn't; therefor, the students should be able to choose their summer projects. When the students chooses their summer projects they are able to choose a topic they are actually interested in, they are able to choose a new topic that they have never heard of so that they may actually learn something new, and the teachers themselves are able to learn new things with all the different subjects the student choose for their summer projects.

When a student is able to choose a subject they are actually interested in they are able to be more creative and hands on. This creativity gives the students the opportunity to put a little bit of themselves making the project more relate able. As the project becomes more relate able the student is able to give more examples about the topic and how it relates to themselves ,and or the real world. Along with this the students are able to put in more effort to his or her project because the interest they have in the topic; fo rexample, If a student who loves history were to do this project she'd more than likely pick a topic that has to do with history like the cold war and gladly do the summer project, but if she were given a topic by the teacher that had to do with science she would not have as much interest in the topic and would be less motivated to complete the summer project. If a teacher were to assign a topic to the students it is likely that the students would either not complete the summer project or complete it to the bare minimum. This is because the students do not have any interest in that topic; therefor, they would not put in as much time and effort into the summer project. It is much easier for the student to complete an assignment that they enjoy learning about because they do not mind spending more time on the topic and or learning more about the topic. Some students may choose a subject they have never learned about, this could beneficial to the student.

If students were given the opportunity to choose their own topic they may choose a topic they know nothing about; for example, A girl who lives Idaho would normally not do a project on the beach because there is no beach around her, but because she was given the opportunity to choose her own topic ,so she decided to research a topic that she new little to nothing about. A student might do this because the topic sparks their interest. When a topic sparks a student interest they are more likely to complete the summer project and get a better grade because the time and effort they put into the summer project. The purpose of the summer projects was for the student to continue learning during the summer ,choosing a topic that one know nothing about does just that. As the student does research on the topic they come into contact with many facts that they did not know therefor they are learning. Along with this the student may become more and more interested with the topic, which leads to more time and effort being put into the project. The student completing the project would also have many topics to choose from. This gives the student a big opportunity to become open minded and research a topic that they have never really considered.

Many beneficial things can come from the student having the freedom to choose their own topic for their summer projects. When students are given just the smallest bit of freedom on their assignments they can accomplish many things. The summer project is an example of this, the students can bring out their creativity and show the greatness they can produce when given this opportunity. Students should choose the topic for their summer assignment because they would be able to do it on something that actually interest them, the students would be able to choose a new subject that they know nothing about so that they may actually learn something new, and the teachers may learn a thing or two from the various topics that the students choose for their summer projects. This is a very big opportunity for the students, perhaps they will provide a great summer project if the opportunity were given to them.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
2A6F79AB6CEA,"The last time I remember having a summer project was when I was in 7th grade. As I think about it now, honesty, I did not find it as bad as other people made it out to be. Sure, we had to write a lot, but it really helped improve my writing skills. I fondly enjoyed writing about books we were interested in, ten times more than writing about the intensely boring ones we were forced to read in school. Of course,not everyone liked summer projects in my school. Some found it boring and others really hated it. This is why I personally consider for summer projects or in general, students and teachers should be both on the same page so each side can benefit. I believe summer projects should be a mix of both teacher's and student's designs based upon evidence from personal experience.

This first piece of evidence of why summer projects should be a mix of both teacher and student design, comes from a conversation I had with one of my friends in 7th grade. It was the almost the end of May and our English teacher had given us our summer reading project. As my teacher started handing out the hefty packets, my friend Generic_Name groaned in disappointment. I looked over to him and said, ""Whats the matter?"" He responded with that he had always hated the summer reading assignments because they were not very interesting. Since I knew I liked them I jokingly responded, ""What do you mean, I love them!"" I can still remember Generic_Name's face of disgust and horror when I spoke those words. ""Okay,Okay, what would make you enjoy the projects more?"" I responded.

He told me that he had wished they had more variety. I knew at the time he loved drawing. If summer reading projects were not just teacher based, Generic_Name would have actually liked them. This evidence helps support the thesis because my friend Generic_Name would have had a better engagement of this assignment if there were places in the project where he could express himself the way he enjoys. Most likely this could have benefited the teachers more because there would have been quality work coming from this project since the students would be more connected to them. This agreement of both the teacher and the student on a assignment is want I want to talk about next.

The next piece of evidence has to deal with a personal experience of mine that can help support how teachers and students designs can benefit both sides;as well as summer projects. This evidence comes from a time where my English teacher in 9th grade and our class, had been discussing over an assignment that should be completed through the ways we creatively liked. Our teacher told us two classes later that the results were amazing and she had fun grading our work because they were all creative and unique. One kid even brought in a guitar to play for the assignment. The reason why this evidence helps support the thesis is because both our class and our teacher shared each others opinions. We came together as one and on how we could make the assignment more engaging for both us and our teacher. Another instance like this happened in 8th grade.

I will always remember 8th grade being the best year of school for me. The reason was because in all of my classes most of my teachers and the class shared and agreed on assignments which made the classes more interesting. One of my favorite classes was history. My teacher, Generic_Name helped engage us in history by acting out certain events that happened. Till this day I still can remember the event that started WWI,thanks to my teacher. An argument that could be made against this is that my teacher loved what he was doing and thats why the class enjoyed history. That can be true because,most of the things I remember for certain classes were because of teachers I had that loved what they were teaching. However since both the students and the teacher agreed with each others decisions, thats what made the class engaging not just the teacher enjoying what he teaches.

There needs to be a connection between the students and the teachers designs on certain projects especially like summer projects. If both students and teachers can agree on one thing then the work provided will be significantly better. The reason for this is because students would be more encouraged to produce quality work based upon the evidence of my 9th grade English project and my 8th grade history teacher. However if there is no agreement then you can have a situation where the students will not like the assignment. Just like how my friend Generic_Name hated summer projects. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
600959D8A343,"Summer projects are done by many students and are used by schools to assure learning over the break. Summer projects are usually assigned by teachers or by the school so they know what and how the student is doing academically over the summer. Most of the time, students find the summer projects annoying and a nuissance to their break and, thus, do the project later in the summer rather than doing gadually over summer. To fix this, students should be able to design what they are doing so that it assures the student wants to do the project, the student gets the opportunity to be more creative, and the student get to control their education and independence.

Having the student design the project they are doing assure that the student wants to complete the project. A student designed project would allow the student to accomplish what they want. For example, if a teacher gave a student a summer project to do over the summer and the student does not like the project, the student would not be inclined to do the project. However, if the student had designed the project, the student would be more inclined to do it since the student would know what exactly they can and cannot do. The student would also be more excited to do the project and thus complete it. Since the student would want to complete project, they would probably retain the information better.

A student designed project would allow the student to be more creative with their learning process and with the finished product in general. Since letting the students design the project means for freedom, the student could become more creative with what they accomplish. For example, if the student designed a book project, they could make the project a video project or a visual arts project or something that would be entertaining rather than a project like a book summary or a relationship between two things. With more creativity, students get to explore more with the topic and relate the topic to something they personally like.

Most importantly, the student would get control over their education. With a teacher designed project, the students would not get that much control over what they learn and would feel dependent on the teacher and not feel ready for the outside world. With a student designed project, the students get to choose what is important to their education and what they need to remember over the summer. The students would also feel a sense of independece from the mostly teacher-based education they normally get. This control and independence would also let the student become prouder of their accomplishment and the finished product.

With the opportunity to be more creative, in control, and independent, student designed projects over the summer would be a great idea for continued learning outside of the classroom. With that opportunity, students would feel a sense of freedom and a sense control over what they are doing. Student designed projects would allow an opportunity for self based learning outside of the classroom.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
FD4A4E94DEDB,"Time and time again, it has been proven that students are more likely to demonstrate an engaged focus when studying topics they have a genuine interest in. For example, elective classes often garner the most frequent acts of student initiative in a variety of academic fields. This is because students have been given the opportunity to explore their own personal interests and have found academic work that feels like an interest rather than a chore. Dedicated study can only truly be achieved once a student feels they have a strong connection to their own work. If schools wish to continue learning throughout summer break, they must allow students to pursue something they will actually find interest in. Student-designed projects are the most reliable option in achieving the desired result of continued learning outside the classroom as they encourage initiative, support individuality, and can be more applicable to students' futures.

Some of the more prominent examples of student initiative in high schools are elective classes and club programs. For example, at Generic_School, many of the elective classes and extracurricular groups have found prosperity through encouragement of student initiative. The school magazine,

Inside15000, has won numerous awards over the years for both design and content. Similarly, the robotics team has received recognition globally for their outreach efforts in spreading the love of STEM to their local community. It is important to note that the main similarity between these groups is their student initiative. The magazine is run by student editors and student staff members, and Robotic's outreach is comprised of hired and elected student leaders. Students in these organizations work year round on academically oriented work that is not graded or assessed. Without the explicit demand of an educator, students are able to pursue ventures in a new way. They are able to create a completely student-designed feat of success. Thus, solidifying the notion that when given the opportunity to create and explore on their own, students take initiative.

Another reason to rely on student-designed projects is their ability to support individuality. Colleges, employers, and leaders alike all look for the individual that sticks out. In life, one of the best things a person can do is be his or her own self. When applying to a job or college in the future, students may be forced to answer the question asked on almost all applications. Why should that individual be considered over or set apart from their peers? If these students have not been given ample opportunity to develop individualistic qualities, they may have their efforts hindered in the future. Summer projects should be used to enhance learning, but also the student as a whole. Having the opportunity to design their own project would provide students with vital opportunity and adversity which can aid them in establishing themselves later in life. Adversity and opportunity lead to advanced character and innovation. Without which, students may never reach their optimal performance or status.

Although character is necessary in later life, specified education is equally as important, if not more so. Allowing students to focus allotted academic time on a topic they wish to pursue in later life is the most practical application of a summer break project. In Ireland secondary school students are required to complete a year of work experience through their school. The intended purpose is to help prepare students for their desired field of work. During a scheduled period of school time, students are able to engage in a myriad of opportunities including internships, seminars, and apprenticeships. It is, however, still important to consider major differences between the Irish school system and the American one when assessing its merit. Though the work experience system is not a currently realistic implication for American students, pursuing endeavors related to their desired future careers can be. One way of allowing for such endeavors is through student-designed projects. Students would be able to dedicate their time and energy into learning something, not purely for the educational value, but for the real world application as well.

There are many reasons to implement student-designed summer projects. All of the aforementioned reasons would consequently contribute to a more well-rounded student. Ultimately, students will create a more unique and well developed project once they are engaged in the subject matter. Therefore, students should most definitely be responsible for designing their own summer break projects. Students should be given the chance to take initiative and explore their own uniqueness. They should also be allowed to pursue knowledge that will eventually make them a profit one day. It is for these reasons, among others, that students should complete student-designed summer break projects as opposed to teacher-designed alternatives.        ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
5672F9F49336,"Summer projects have usually been designed by teachers, but it would be better if the students were the ones who designed? Most summer projects have been designed by teachers to help students keep learning throughout the summer. Students should be able to choose what they want to research with more freedom so they can enjoy what they're writing. Student-designed summer projects is a chance for students to enjoy and have freedom in the topic of their choosing.

Students should be able to enjoy the project they are doing over the summer. Summer projects are so students are still learning throughout the summer. One example of someone doing a research that they could enjoy is, if that person loves nature and hiking they could make a project on wildlife or the growth of plant species in a mountain or forest. During the summer everyone is trying to have fun and a summer project on a topic a student does not like will cause them to feel bored or burnt out. For that to not happen they also need more freedom in the topics that they choose.

Student freedom in a project is one of the most important parts of a student-designed summer projects. Freedom of choosing what the topic would be has a couple benefits. Students are more likely to enjoy what they are researching, students will be able to debate topic that they couldn't have based on restrictions that a teacher might have placed, and Students would feel more motivated to do the project. Many students do not enjoy their summer projects based on how restrictive it can be, so they can meet their teacher's rubric and expectations. A student's motivation is key to how the project will result in and having more freedom will allow them to explore topics that they never could.

Student-designed summer projects is a way for a student to enjoy and have freedom in a topic of their choosing. Students with freedom will tend to enjoy their research and will be more lilekly to produce a wonderful assignment. Teacher-designed summer projects are a thing of the past and should allow the student to design a project that will let them enjoy their vacation and find something educational along the way.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
794A0704B01C,"School is very important to a students future. It allows different parts of the brain to flourish and grow whether it be in the main subjects like Math, Science, English and History, or even in the arts like music, dance, and theater. Even though students learn new things throughout the year, the new found information can sometimes be forgotten because of the lack of practice, which is why students completing summer projects is so important. The only problem with this is the decision on whether the projects should be student or teacher designed. While some teacher-designed projects are good, summer projects should be designed by the student because this way their summer plans will not get interrupted, the student can choose a topic that interests them, and it allows the student to learn responsibility.

While school is very important, relaxation and downtime can be extremely beneficial too. When people become overwhelmed with school they begin to stop doing work and paying attention because they feel as though their is no point in doing work, if they are just going to fail anyways. Having a summer vacation and making plans to hang out with friends and family can relieve some of the stress put on students, because they can take that break to re-energize their interest in learning. Summer plans can also consist of traveling to other countries, which could be beneficial in a students topic. If a teacher were to design the projects, then the student would not only miss out on a spectacular opportunity to travel, because of having to stay home to do the project, but also because of a fun interesting topic they had to miss out on.

Another reason why summer projects should be student designed is because of the risk of students not being interested. The danger in this scenario is that when a student becomes uninterested in what they are learning, it causes the student to not pay attention and stop doing work because of the lack of strive to learn. Not only does this situation cause a strain on the student who did not do his or her work, and the teacher, but also the other students in the class. The other students are also effected, because the teacher is now required to take the time out of the new lessons to re-teach what should have already been learned. To prevent this lack of gusto, summer projects should be chosen by the students so they can pick a topic that makes them want to learn.

Having student choose their topics for their summer project is beneficial because it allows the student to learn important life skills they can use in the future. From being able to pick their topic, a student accepts the responsibility to create a project and execute it over the summer. This new found responsibility can encourage a student to create a planner to organize a schedule, make sure the project is relevant and challenging, and also that they can get the project done over their break, splitting their time doing fun activities and being able to recognize ones priorities. Students learning responsibilities like these at a young age can prepare them for their future careers. Since responsibility is such a big part in everyday life as an adult it is important that students learn how to be responsible now than in the future when it is too late.

Since some schools require summer projects they should be student- designed because students should have a summer to relax and not have their plans ruined, students can choose a topic they are interested in and it allows students to learn responsibility. While there are so many more examples of why summer projects should be student led the examples stated are the most important ones. Students being able to make their own decisions is apart of life, and the school system not granting that experience is a tragedy because is stunts a students growth in learning.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
56090663E82F,"During their summer vacation, students look forward to their time off of school and a break from the stress of their school work. However, often times, teachers provide students with an assignment to complete over the summer in order to ensure that they remain knowledgeable and don't forget what they worked so hard to learn during the school year. It is important that these summer assignments be teacher-designed because it guarantees that the students are reminded of what they really need to know, takes unnecessary stress off of students, and makes grading these assignments easier for the teachers.

It is better for students' summer assignments to be designed by their teacher to make sure that the students are practicing the information that they really need to know and not completing useless assignments. If given total freedom to create a project just for the sake of learning something, a student could be practicing skills that will not be useful to them in the coming school year, and waste their break on an assignment that will have no value on their future education. However, if given a structured assignment designed by teachers who know the curriculum and what students will need to carry with them into a new school year, the benefit of the assignment would enhance greatly and there would be no debate on whether or not the project was beneficial. In addition, some students may take their projects in very different directions and end up ahead or behind other students who didn't have the structure to be as successful as they could have been. This creates problems, not only for the students, but for the teachers who will start the year with a class of students at all different levels. To avoid this problem, the summer projects assigned should be created by teachers, rather than the students.

In addition, being given a set list of directions and expectation from their teacher would take stress off of many students who get lost with so much freedom. After all, it is their vacation, and while it is important that they continue to learn year-round, students should not have to stress over their school work during the break that they look forward to since the moment the school year starts. Many students, if told, ""write a five paragraph essay about your favorite animal that incorporates two quotes and three different uses of commas"", would be able to stick to that structure and hit every point of the assignment without any problem. On the other hand, if students were just simply told, ""write and essay about anything you want"", they get no sense of what their teacher is looking for and, again, could potentially write an essay that won't support what they should be practicing. All of this is to say, many students thrive with some sort of structure, which would only be provided if teachers created the project for their students to complete during the summer.

Lastly, if teachers were to design the summer projects for their students, it would undoubtedly make grading them easier. Starting off the beginning of the year with an assignment from every single student that needs to be graded is a struggle when paired with setting up a classroom, meeting all of their students, and establishing the rules and curriculum in their class. It would lift a burden off of not only the students, but the teachers as well. To speed up the process, it would be beneficial for teachers to grade different variations of the same assignment, rather than having to carefully check a mix of project to see if it meets their expectations. In order to make the lives of both parties a little bit easier, teachers should create the summer assignments for their students.

Why add to the stress and work load of both students and teachers by making students design their own summer project? Rather than benefiting students in a way that supports the goal of the assignment, to keep them reminded of what they need to remember in the future, it takes away unnecessary time from their well-deserved break. It just ends up doing more harm than good to both student and teachers, Luckily, there is an easy solution to this problem: make summer projects teacher-designed. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
158EDBD5EC25,"No one likes summer projects, it just interferes with the whole point of summer which is to have fun and forget about school. But imagine having to come up with your own project, than having to complete the project that you already made by the end of the summer, doesnt that sound like so much work. Summer Projects should be teacher-designed because it is easier to grade for the teachers, you would be able to work with your peers in your class, and it would be less work to complete for students.

If everyone were to come up with their own project it would be difficult on the teachers end because they would have to grade everyones project. Each kid would have a completely different project from each other, which would cause confusion and take up too much of the teachers time. In Generic_School one year they actually tried to experiment if kids would be more productive if they were to make their own project and it turns out that students were emailing my teacher like seven times a day asking questions about each of their projects just for them to fail that exact project. That is when they realized that the student-designed project was not the smartest thing to come up with.

With everyone having pretty much the same summer project it would give students the chance to work in groups with their peers. Working in groups could help build social skills, it could better your leadership skills, and it could make you more open minded on certain topics and ideas. Working in groups could also increase your chances of getting a good grade because you would of other students working on it aswell and profreading it which would increase the chances of your project getting a good grade. I noticed everytime I would work in groups for certain assignments that my chancing of getting a passing grade was higher because I had other people helping me with the assignment and making sure it was done to the best of my ability.

Summer is all about having fun and enjoying your summer without interuptions. Summer projects defeat the whole purpose of having a summer break because you still are requiered to finish up assignments while trying to have fun on vacation, So having the least amount of work would be beneficial to the students and teacher because they coud spend more time enjoying their summer instead of focusing on work. It woud be easier for the student to complete and easier for the teacher to grade through. If a students feels as if an assignment is too much for them to complete some might get lazy to the point where they will not even want to complete the assignment because their is no point in doin an assignment the will not complete.

However having students design their own projects would be a great idea because it would force them to think creatively, and wisely. It would make students have to think outside the box in order for them to earn the grade they deserve, it would make them strive for the grade they want. Students work hard for the things that they believe in, and spend time doing so why not have them assign their own projects and complete them, it also would be easier for them to complete since they made the project themselves.

As you can see having teacher-designed summer projects would have students working more productively, would keep teachers from doing too much when it comes to grading and it would be less work to complete on the students. So next time you see your teacher make sure to appreciate them for not over loading you with work over the summer and minimizing the asingments to the best of their abilites.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
F7561C027920,"In high school, summer projects (especially for advanced placement classes) are assignments that students must complete. There is no way to get out from completing those assignments. Teachers create most of these summer projects because they know exactly what the students should learn before they reach the first class of the year. For example, AP Language and Composition has the students create 15 precis on different nonfiction pieces and read the book

Thank You for Arguing in order to prepare for some of the essays that will be written for the exam. Although many people believe that teachers should create these summer projects because the students would know exactly what they need to learn or prepare for, nevertheless, students should be the ones creating the summer projects because it gives them a chance to show their creativity, use their skills from prior knowledge, and build on life skills needed for the future.

Giving the students the ability to use their creativity is very important because it lets their voices and thoughts be heard. Students usually have more time over the summer to be able to express their creativity, but that is being pulled back due to the same projects that teachers have them do every year. For example, most high school math classes provide students with a four to six page study guide to complete over the summer to make sure that their prior knowledge is still remembered. What if students created their own, unique study guides to complete? How about a presentation on the basics of a unit and sharing it with the class the first or second day back? Not only would the students be able to use their creativity in a project and express their knowledge in many different ways, students in the first class would have a great review of prior knowledge to prepare them for the challenge ahead. Giving students an assignment that they create also makes them more interested and determined to complete their project. Most students would rather show what they learned their own way than the same way as everyone else, and a lot of teacher-designed assignments have the students all doing the same thing. It might be easier for the teacher to grade or review, but students aren't enjoying the assignment because they aren't able to express their knowledge that is different from everyone else. Letting the students create their own projects will give them the opportunity to be creative and express their ideas. Additionally, students will continue to use or remember the skills and knowledge prior to help them create their projects.

The biggest reason why these summer projects are created is so that students wouldn't lose the skills and knowledge from previous years that are need for their upcoming classes. If the students created their own summer projects, they would not lose those skills or knowledge at all. More than likely, they would research more about certain skills or information in order to make their projects even better and stand out from their peers. Subjects such as science and english are definitely able to make this happen because the skills and techniques that are learned can always be worked on, and they are easier for students to share what they know about certain topics. For example, AP chemistry has everyone doing the same assignment before the school year starts. Students in AP Chemistry, instead, could create their own experiments with the skills and knowledge acquired from Research Chemistry. The students would not only keep the techniques/skills practiced and knowledge from the year before, but also have the opportunity to explore different skills or use the skills obtained at a more advanced level. Even though students wouldn't lose the skills and knowledge learned from previous classes, they would also learn and build on some others skills such as life skills.

Student-designed projects would build on skills that students need for the future. Teachers help them practice life skills with these projects as they could be long and tedious. However, students should have opportunities to build these skills themselves to prepare them for the upcoming school year and their future in general. Students who would work really hard on their own summer projects build their organizational skills as they plan out their assignments. Time management is another skill that is taken into these projects. Practicing time management prepares them for college and their future careers as deadlines can't be rearranged, and some tasks take more time than others. They would be able to schedule how much time in a day they can work on their summer assignments. Students who create their own projects also practice focusing and perseverance. There will be times where the project comes to a stand still in progress; practicing focus and perseverance encourages students to not give up on their projects and to make it the best it can be. In conclusion, students will prepare themselves for future tasks such as college projects and career projects when they create their own summer projects in high school.

So, what is the point on arguing about whether students or teachers should create the summer projects? These projects set up the students for what is coming in the following school year. The knowledge and skills used in previous classes are still needed for the upcoming classes. However, when students are able to be creative and make their own projects, those skills and knowledge would never leave them. In fact, teachers would be amazed at how advanced the skills of their students are because the students were actually interested in learning more to create an amazing summer project.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
49340A641E1E,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure they continue learning during their break. Students should get to choose the project they want because they will learn more and will enjoy doing a topic of their liking. Having a teacher choose could likely end up in failure to complete, due to the topic and student preference. Allowing them the freedom of choice will result in a higher pass rate and assurance of learning on break.

The first reason schools should let students choose is because the student will enjoy doing the project. A student will choose something that keeps them interested and entertained which will assure they complete and get a good grade on the project. Most teen students have a short attention span which could cause them to get bored and stop trying if they get a topic that isnt enjoyable for them. As a result in students doing the topic they enjoy, they focus more and can get it done easier

The second reason schools should let students choose is because they will learn more as they progress on the project. When students choose their own topic of their liking it proves they'll learn more the more research is done about that topic. A student may not know where to find specific information required if a teacher chose the topic since they wont know much or anything about it. research has shown that even lazy students learned more while on break because they got to choose a topic they enjoyed.

If students chose the topic then a student could already know everything about it which may result in them not learning more while on break. Students could have also done a previous project on the same topic they chose this time and they could remake it and result in learning nothing.

In conclusion, schools that require summer projects should allow students to design and choose the topic. Having this will result in the whole class completing the project and get a passing grade on it. Students will complete it easily and will know where to find the information without any issue. This will assure they have learned more and retained any information in their heads",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
C8E9D6F3C80A,"Rules are a basic principle in the world.

If you follow the rules, you don't get in trouble.

In school, there are some classes that require students to learn over the summer break through an assignment.

The purpose of these summer assignments is to ensure that students are maintaining or learning knowledge that will be used in the class the following year.

Teacher-designed assignments are generally more effective than those created by students.

They provide an accurate workload, take more work off students, and educate them through a teacher-designed assignment.

Teachers should continue to create and design the summer assignments in order to ensure that students are learning the information needed for the coming school year.

The amount of work dictated by a student-designed summer assignment is very likely to be little to none.

Students create simple projects for many reasons.

Those reasons include ensuring that they have less work, creating an easy way to cheat the assignment, and fabricating the idea that they are actually learning and maintaining new information.

Students see summer as a break from work and stress, and with a summer assignment that they are assigned to create, they will take any shortcuts they can discover.

For example, if a teacher assigns a self-reflective summer assignment for the AP Language class, a student could create a set of five flashcards and call it a day.

With no guidelines to be enforced, how will the students effectively learn the material that the teachers assign?

Teachers need to create the assignments in order to enforce a strong way of learning.

If not, then students will cheat their way through the work and not be prepared for the start of a new year.

Work is a concept that no student enjoys.

If students were to create their own summer assignment, they would spend even more time thinking about what they would want to do rather than actually fulfilling the needed criteria.

If a Junior in High School is assigned a summer assignment in which they have full control, they would need to create a meaningful and efficient piece of work that would assist them in maintaining and learning the information needed for the class.

Assuming that the student has a rigorous summer schedule, where would they have the time to effectively plan and carry out a summer assignment in which they can comprehend the information necessary for the class?

Creating the work needed for a summer assignment is no easy task.

To effectively create the work, teachers need to understand the material, as well as understand which material is needed for the student to rehearse and learn over the summer.

Students can not effectively prepare themselves for the class over the summer if they have no idea what material they need to cover, as well as how to cover it.

I was assigned a summer assignment last summer for AP Psychology.

My class was required to do research on the education for a particular branch of psychology to prepare for a test that we would receive in our first week back.

Everyone did different branches of psychology, but we all did the same content.

Basically we all answered the same questions when it came to the assignment.

Needless to say most of my class ended up passing the test with flying colors.

The ones that didn't do well were those that went off on their own tangents.

A buddy of mine created his own worksheet that consisted of incorrect information, which led to him failing the test.

He told me afterward that the instructions said to come up with your own resource to study for the test, and that's what he did, leading him to fail.

Student-designed summer assignments can be reliable in some cases.

If you're a rising Senior in High School then you could use the opportunity to help prepare yourself for the future.

It would be a valuable learning experience that you could use in your life.

The problem is that the Seniors would continue to try and fudge their way through the system.

They wouldn't be able to effectively learn and maintain the information if they are left to their own agendas.

A student at Generic_School, Generic_Name, was told to do a project over the summer while following guidelines, while another student was told to just do a project.

Both would take a test when they got back from break.

Which student would most likely do better on the exam?

The one who was assigned the guidelines, or the one that was more freelanced?

Students need to follow guidelines in order to perform well on exams and the future.

Summer assignments are not a favorite topic.

When it comes to the whole idea of a summer assignment, we expect a teacher-based project that informs us on what information we need to learn and construct.

Teacher-designed summer assignments allow for higher understanding of a subject, less overall work for students, and a more accurate workload that shows the knowledge of the student.

Summer assignments are meant to help students learn and prepare for the next school year.

They aren't meant to trick and deceive students into thinking that they can fudge their way through the course.

Following the rules is how you will succeed.  ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
5470F4CF4DED,"Teacher Designed Summer Projects

Summer finally comes to an end and all students have completed their student designed summer project. Students are one month into school and realize the summer projects they created has not helped them prepare for school. Students are put into a horrible scenario, where they are mentally not prepared for school and are assigned many assignments they cant keep up with. It is a teachers job to create projects, tests, and assignments to help further improve a students ability to learn and understand the subject.

Summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers are familiar with the format, would prepare students for school, and students are inexperienced project designers.

Many people disagree with the idea of having a teacher design a summer project for students. The opposing side believes that students should create summer projects because students would feel familiar with the format and would feel stress free. What critics fail to consider is students have never created a summer project before and would be stressed when school starts, due to creating a bad project. Teachers have always been the people that create the summer projects, so they are more familiar with creating a great project design. Teachers are great at preparing students for school and upcoming challenges. Students may stress a little over the summer, but the teacher designed projects would help students be prepared for the school year and cause less stress. Teachers are known to help students and would try their best to help students ready for the next year.

Teachers have created assignments and projects for years.

Teachers are very familiar with the format of creating a summer project due to the previous years. A teacher would know what information to put for the students whether if its easy or hard. For example, a teacher could make a project based on review and information learned from the previous year. Teachers can make the project familiar to the students based on recent studies or similar assignments they have made during the year. Students would then be more understanding of the project and remember the information they have been taught. Students would then have to actively use their brain to remember information and how to complete the project due to previous assignments. Teachers are good at spreading out the variety of information on a assignment, so students can learn and remember more than one unit. For instance, teachers can eliminate the repetition of a unit/subject that can possibly be put, and have a variety of information. Teachers would help students remember information taught throughout the year and let them be able to solve it in the project. The repetition of a subject could be created by a student if they designed their own project. Teachers are used to creating assignments and due to the many years of creating summer projects, it would be perfect for teachers, due to them being familiar with the format.

Teachers are very good at helping students get ready for the upcoming tests, by giving students the necessary information needed. By letting teachers design summer projects for students, it would allow them to prepare students for the next school year. To explain this, teachers would give a certain amount of questions for students to complete, so students can continue to learn and use their brain power through break. As students advance in their school years, they would start to receive more assignments and projects. By allowing teachers to design summer projects, they can help prepare students for that certain situation, by giving students a little more work or questions then students think they would receive. Teachers could make projects a little more advanced by giving students a more challenging or different format, to prepare them for the upcoming school year. To demonstrate this, teachers can give students a research project, so students would have to use both their brains and online websites to find their information. This prepares students for the school year, by challenging them to actually focus on their projects and be more familiar on how their future assignments would look like.

If teachers create summer projects, it would help students be more prepared and less stressed for the upcoming new school year.

Teachers have always been the ones to create assignments, because it's their jobs. If a students created a summer project, they would poorly design it, due to their lack of experience. Students would not know how to exactly format the projects. To demonstrate this, students can create a project that doesn't meet requirements for a student to learn and work on. It would be hard for a group of students to decide on how to make their projects, because they are not taught to create projects. Students aren't as skilled as teachers to design a perfect format for all students to complete during the summer. Many students like to enjoy their summer without school projects, because they think projects are a lot of work, or very hard. If students have the power to create a summer project, they would poorly design it, for it to be easier. To clarify, students would make the questions or requirements to complete the projects very easy. Students would not create a challenging project for other students to complete. This can poorly prepare students for the next school year, which can leave students very stressed.

The arguable statement on whether if students or teachers should create summer projects is clearly obvious. Teachers should create summer projects because teachers have experience, can help students better prepare for school, and students have no experience of formatting a project. Teachers have a great impact on helping students ready for school. A petition must be signed by teachers and schools to allow teachers to continue to create summer projects. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
D0C6EB30D833,"Did you know every summer students are assigned to summer reading? Students are required to read at least one book or more in order to stay engaged in learning. Summer projets should be teacher-designed because you get extra help, you worry less, and you create a stronger bond with the teacher. First, I belive summer projects should be teacher-designed because you get extra help from the teacher. By getting extra help, you able to work on your mistakes and fix them. In this case, you are free to get assistence from you teacher regarding any concept you do not understand and he or she will be more than welcome to help you. For example, incase you are working on an assignment that is math related and there happens to be a question you have worked on several times but still can not figure out, you will then find the need to explain your weaknesses to your teacher so that they work on a solution for your concerns and questions about that specific problem you are trying to solve. As a matter of fact, if you happen to be struggling with any particular subject having teacher-designed projects is more helpful and significant hence you are attaining help and directions from a professional person who understands what they are doinig as well as what you need help on a much higher level that outstand that of a student-designed one. That being said, a teacher-designed summer project is a perfect way to continue learning because you are not only being assisted by getting extra help on a specific assignment, but you are getting more knowledge and benefiting your education even when you are not in school. In other words, you are learning from your mistakes by fixing them with the right tools you need through your teacher and that results in you being more confident and comfortable on that very topic or project you had issues with in the first place. Indeed, getting extra help from you teacher will help you get better grades and following a well teacher-designed summer project will put you in good position for working hard and working on your communication skills as well as keeping your brain sharp and training it to endure any complex situations such as making sure you complete any due work and homework on time. In conclusion, a teacher-designed summer project is the better option to work with since the student is being given extra help on a certain topic or concept they do not understand and as a result the student not only gets assisted and help, but also works on their weak areas and try to fix their mistakes and make them better. Next, I strongly agree that summer projects should be teacher-designed because students do not get stressed or over worry on any assignement since they know they are working with their teacher. Because students are on vocations, this is their time to get caught up on their favorite hobbies and fun activities with their friends and one last thing they would want to think about is doing some sort of homework during their free relaxing time with family and friends moreover on a summer morning. For instance, lets say a student wants to hang out with friends on a saturday evening, but they remember they have a whole packet of work that was assigned to them before summer vocation and that by the end of summer before school starts, they have to finish it. The student will most liekly be worried and concerned about getting it over with and that means they will either cancell hanging out with friends and stay home doing random summer assigned homework on a saturday, but this is not the case when you know you are working with you teacher and that they will be able to walk you through all the work. Students surely worry less when they are working with a teacher on summer projects hence them doing something fun and relaxing in their free time sinc their teacher is available at any given point. School related projects or assignments are more easier to handle when your teacher is always there to work with you on that specific assigned assignment. As a result, students are much likely to enjoy their time away from school without anything bothering them for whatsoever case. Since students have already endured and served their time on the previous school year, they do not need any kind of aspect worrying them to the point where they have to stay home rather than them having fun and enjoying themselves and having a good time on a summer beach day while having fresh air and cooling off. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed since students are not getting overwhelmed with what they need complete, but rather having some fun time with their friends and telling jokes and laughing them off with their relatives and maybe their pets who knows. To sum it up, summer projects should highly be teacher-designed because of the students' mental state and their happiness. Finally,summer projects should be teacher-designed beacuse the students get to somewhat create a strong bond with their teacher. By doing so, teachers and students are most likely to get along with each other with no issues of any kind. Teachers are more than people who went to school and got their degree, but they are also regualr people just like everyone esle and at a certain point they become like family to us. So it is important for students to make sure they are in good terms with their teacher just in case they need help or guidance from the teachers, they will not get it if they behaved wrongly or cursed at their teachers which is something we often see in schools today. Well, if students and teacher manage to keep a steady and firm bond between one another, no obstacle or problem will come between their relationship, meaning they will be able to work with each other on a daily basis with no problematic concerns from either side. That being said, no matter what they have against each other, they will be able to work it out since they have created a bond that never breaks. In conclusion, teacher-designed projects are best",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
ADF83B2078E9,"It is said that some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure the student continues learning during their break. I think that these projects should be student-designed. I feel these projects should be student- designed because it gives the student more to learn about due to it being their ideas, it gives the student more independence, and it allows the student to be mor creative as well. Allowing student-designed projects be possible, gives the students a chance to think for themselves. Giving student this opportunity opens doors for more creativity and descision making.

Being able to create and mold your own ideas, gives students more confidence in their work. Though some students prefer teacher-designed projects, they aren't allowing themselves that chace to come up with and give theirown thoghts and ideas. For example a student who's teacher says they can do a favorite place in the world project would have more excitement and come up with so many different ideas fot he projects, verses a student that is given a certain place to do the project on. Each individual student has their own mind. Allowing these students their own minds and creativity to be used with the projects would show their special abilities.

Another reason students should be allowed to do student-designed projects is because, it allows gives the student the ability to learn more due to it being their idea. Now-a-days students with teacher-designed projects can copy and paste the information. This does not give the stuudent the chance to learn about the information being given. One example would be me being given a teacher-designed project,copy and pasting it without reading one word about what the project was based on; Or being given a project i was able to read about on my own and learn more information about due to my mind being used. Even though some students do not want to think and just think of just giving in the assignment, they are not using their own ideas just ones provided.

The last reason students should be allowed student-based projects is because, they should be allowed the independency to make their own choices and think for themselves. Allowing students to think for themselves prepares them for the real world and choices tthey would make in the future. For example I am being given a chance to either work on a project according to how I want about any topic I want in my class, but my classmate decides to take the teacher-designed project to just get it over with. That classmate isn't allowing themsleves to think on their own and have their oen mindset. Students in the head space of just getting things over with, miss out on alot of opportunities in life because of it.

In conclusion, students should be allowed to express their creativity and reasons for them. Not all students want o be confined to what the teahers allow them to do, especially when it comes to projects. Students showuld be able to show that they know more then hat the teacher does. All in all students can rise to more then the standard of what the teachers think is acceptable. Teachers should allow the students to be creative and expand their minds beyond just projects as well.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
6D4DCE0C2EF6,"Summer assignments should be designed by the student with the whole student body in mind. The point of school is to prepare and benefit an individual for the remainder of their life in society. With this in mind, school work should be universally understood by the student so that everyone is in mind and everyone has an equal opportunity. What better way for an assignment to be understood if its created by the student? Students know themselves and their peers more than teachers do, so it would be best if students made a project that would suit them best.

A summer assignment is more of a pain than the usual assignment because it takes away precious time from the summer, so in order to make the project less of a chore, it would lift the spirit of the student if it was them in charge of what the work load could be. The student wouldn't see it as much of a woeful task, but rather a commitment they themselves made. If its more personalized, then students would take more time and dedication to work on the assignment. It would feel more like a prompt that would be in their best interest to better themselves and not a school issued worksheet.

Also, a student designed project would benefit the teachers, too. They wouldn't have to take the time out of their busy schedule to produce a lengthy assignment, and having a teacher designed one would make it more standardized and less suitable to the audience it is targeting. It would be mundane and frankly, acrimonious for a teacher to grade an assignment they created, especially depending on how many students are doing the project. It would be a relief for the teacher and would prove that their students are responsible and ambitious enough to create and work on a school assignment that proves their own worth as a student.

In my personal experience with summer assignments, the school has always issued work designed by the county. This has proved to be not that efficient of a task, because most of my classmates failed to complete, or even attempt to do the summer project because it was so daunting, and the fact that it was to be done over the summer made it worse. I'll even admit I didnt finish any of my summer assignments either for that same reason. The teachers speak of summer assignments with much vicar, thus showing that both teacher and student loath the project. Now there would be a different outcome if it was student designed. The student would have completed it since it was a project that they committed to, and the teacher would see it as a task that builds the character of a student.

A student designed project is in many ways a better alternative to teacher designed ones. Its an assignment benefits everyone involved. Students would likely finish to project in a shorter time since it would hold their attention. It is a task that gets a student prepared for the following year, and what better way to have a teacher introduced to a student by grading a piece of work created by the student themselves. A student designed summer assignment is the only way to go.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
E14632E60C40,"Summer is all about being free from the stress that school, teachers, and assignments create during the fall, winter, and spring, but there are times when classes require students to complete certain tasks that have a template that is designed by the teacher. Students need to be able to control their time and energy during break to be able to complete summer assignments successfully, so by having students design their own projects over the summer, students can learn based on their own terms and at their own pace, they can apply themselves creatively and in a workload aspect, and create a sense of independence which strengthens their applicability.

Students want to take summer at their own perspective pace; moving too fast or too slow would only create stress and cause them to focus too much on their work and/ or possibly too little on it. By giving students the ability to design their own projects, they can learn and work at their own pace and on their own terms. This gives students the ability to have summer break feel smooth, comfortable, and not as if they are completing work that goes outside their ""outside of school"" comfort zone. The summer mindset is very liberal and reciprocity should only flow congruently with it so that students can move along freely with their projects.

Creating an environment that goes based on an individual student's mindset allows for them to be more tenacious. By giving students the opportunity to design their own work, they feel more obligated to put as much effort that they are most comfortable with as possible. It's a method of ""teaching"" self-reliance, which gives the students a starting point to see how much they can really apply themselves and utilize their creativity to its maximized potential; although, teacher-designed projects tend to be most specific and direct, which directly gives students something to start with; however, this can limit usage of students' creative prowess, applicable knowledge and abilities that maximize creative output and work-management tendencies in the long run.

Self-reliance is key to the summer mindset. Students are all about being more independent, not just from parents and guardian figures, but being more independent from school as well. Removing guidance and direct expectations from the workload, this gives the students a chance to build self-reliance and strengthens reasons for them to work on their own terms and at their own pace. Students being able to design their own projects ultimately allows for them to work more independently and non-conjugally from the summer mindset.

In the end, it's all about how each individual student can manage their whole summer and incorporate their summer ideals into their school work. Self-creating the projects and creating an ideal rubric is the best way for students to work outside of the school year because they can learn and work at their own pace, truly do their work based on their own applications and efforts, and build self-reliance by subtracting guidance from their work. What the individual wants and how they think completely overpowers any teacher-designed project because tenacity and effort becomes exposed once students work based on their ideals, desires, and with their own brain.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
6D091EC2A64B,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These projects can either be teacher-designed or student-designed. Many people feel that these projects should be student-designed so that the students are being creative and learning at the same time. However, a teacher-designed summer project is more beneficial for the students. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it allows students to see what they need to know for the following school year, it refreshes on subjects that students learned in their previous years at school, and it allows for all students to know the same information when school starts.

Having a teacher-designed summer project is helpful for students to get a glimpse at what they will be learning in the upcoming school year. The project gives problems, or work, that the teacher finds important for their students to look at before their first day of class. It makes the students feel prepared and more comfortable when seeing the work in the classroom. One example of this would be asking Spanish students to name three Spanish-speaking countries. By looking up these places, the students will gather a little information and already know about the topic before class even starts. Once back in school, the teacher will start teaching about where Spanish-speaking countries are, and how each one is unique, but the students will already have some information from when they found these countries over the summer. By having the teacher-designed summer project, students are able to work proactively for the next school year.

Teacher-designed summer projects are important because they help students review on major topics from their previous years at school. An example of this is Algebra II math teachers. They have to make sure students remember everything from Algebra I before they can expand and teach new topics in math. By putting problems on the summer assignment from Algebra I, it allows the students to review and remember more from that class. Then when going back to school in the fall, the teacher can spend less time reviewing old material, and start teaching new things to the students. Another example of this is World History II teachers. By having a teacher-designed summer project, they can put important things to remember so that students refresh on the topics that are necessary for that class. The teacher knows exactly what will be taught through the school year and can make the summer assignment a great review for the upcoming class.

Summer projects should also be teacher-designed because it makes sure all students are on the same page. Students come from a variety of teachers with many different styles of teaching. By having a teacher-designed summer assignment, it ensures that the students will be doing the same work. In that case, the teacher can compare the student's project and see if the students are on the same level. They can also see what was hard for the students as a whole, and what was easy. The teacher can use it as a guide for the class, on what needs to be reviewed and taught more in depth. It is important for summer assignments to be designed by the teacher so they can see how the class is going to learn.

Summer projects are very important for students to review, work, and learn during their long break. They keep people from forgetting everything that was learned over the previous school year. By having the summer projects be teacher-designed, students are able to be proactive, open-minded, and efficient when doing their work. It makes sure the work they are doing is important, and useful, in the upcoming school year. It also keep the students on track for new topics and allows them to see what their teacher will teach over the course of the year. Teacher-designed summer projects are important for students to learn to their fullest abilities. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9259FAACA3D3,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these Summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? One may believe that the students should be able to design their own projects rather than the teacher do it for them. This way, students are more likely to complete the project, there is a higher chance that they will understand it, and it gives them an opportunity to be creative and overall learn more.

Letting students design their own projects holds a higher chance of them actually completing it. If the teachers were to design the project the students may not like the topic causing them to not try hard, or worse, not complete it. Most may believe that students should be able to choose a topic they actually agree with, instead of being forced to do as their teachers say.

If students choose the design of their projects there is a more likely chance of them understanding it. Some teachers have a habit of choosing confusing topics for their students to do projects on. Students will most likely not do too great of a job on a topic they do not have the least amount of knowledge about. Students have more of an understanding of what they know then their teachers do.

Allowing students to choose the design of their projects gives them an opportunity to be creative and overall learn more. If the student chooses their own topic it gives them a chance to learn more about a topic they are already interested in. Without having rules set by teachers, they can be creative about the way they set up their project. Creativity is a big part of the learning process.

On the other hand, some may believe that teachers would do a better job at designing the project, because they could choose a topic their students know nothing about so they will learn more, although, others may not agree with this opinion. In conclusion, students being more likely to understand, students actually completing their work, and students having the opportunity to be creative and learn more are all the reasons one might need to give students the choice to design their own project. ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
DA1108A0B880,"What would be the best way for students to continue learning over the break teacher-designed or student-designed projects? In my opinion,teacher-designed projects would be the best way for students to continue learning over the break. The teachers have many assignments they can give to the students over the break. They also know would be best for their students. The teachers will assign something that will be beneficial to the students.

Initially,these summer projects should be teacher-designed because it will give the teacher a good look while they are helping the students expand their mind. It shows how much they care for their students to design them a project for them. The teacher will be helping the students grasp their knowledge while their on break. The project the teacher designed will increase their intelligence and challenge their minds.

Most importantly,teachers know what is best for their students. They already been through school,learned graduated,and earn their degrees. They will give us projects that will keep our minds fresh and stimulated For example,my teacher was named Mr. Generic_Name teaches Biology my tenth grade year. He teaches Biology class second block. He gave me a five page packet over my summer break. It was about some lessons I really didn't understand in his class. It really helped me out the next year i was the top kid in class because of the packet he designed for me.

However that might be the case but,If the projects were student-designed they could design a project that is about their weak points to work on them..Also,if the students create the projects it showed how creative they are and how much they care about their education. They will also get the opportunity to create projects they'll enjoy doing and still get a good lesson from it. For example,Generic_Name designed his project on his game system now, he get to play the game and do his work at the same time. Although,some students might be too busy or not even take the time to design one. If the teacher already have the project designed that all they have to do is take the time to do it.

In total,teacher-designed projects will allow the students to continue learning over their break. It will also give the teachers the change to show the societty how much they care about their students. Teachers know what is the best way for their students to grasp in knowledge while they are not at school. If the projects was created by your teacher it is some to help you.

3ACABEEA34D2,"Summer projects, meant to ensure students continue learning throughout summer, should be teacher-designed instead of student-designed. Student-designed courses would fail to be well focused around the course, as teachers would not be able to guide the students through the process of developing and carrying out these projects. Those who take the project seriously and those that do not will also result in drastically different kinds of projects. In contrast, teacher-designed projects would provide a good quality of learning, that all students will be learning the same material, and insight into the course and the teacher. Depending on how the teacher structures the assignment, the project should still allow students to express their own thoughts and ideas while maintaining a solid standard of work.

When a teacher designs a project for their class, the class is given standards they are expected to meet. As someone who is well-versed in their field, the teacher will be able to decide what the project should focus on, as well as how in-depth it should be to properly prepare their students. Therefore, students will be well prepared for the course, as well as have a firm grasp on the type of things the course will teach them. Without this supervision, it remains inevitable that all students will think differently, resulting in projects of varying qualities. This inequality would lead to an awkward period of time in the new school year, as the students will enter the year with uneven levels of education. The teacher would have to do work anyways, as they would be forced to catch some students up while others find themselves with nothing to do.

With the previously mentioned idea that students will think differently, that includes the fact that students will choose different topics. If the project were teacher-designed, the topics students were allowed to research would be relevant and helpful to what students would be learning later. These would be greatly beneficial to students, as it better prepares them for the course. However, if the projects were student-designed, some may not even be relevant to the course the students are supposed to be taking. Instead of a helpful summer project to ensure the continuation of learning, students who chose worse topics than others would find the project as both unhelpful and a waste of time, leaving them less prepared than their peers.

As mentioned before, teacher-designed projects deliver insight into the class and the teacher's method of teaching through what is expected of the students. For example, a psychology class in which the teacher wants their students to reflect deeply upon themselves might assign a summer assignment that involves such a task. If the students were to decide for themselves what they wanted their project to revolve around, the teacher would never be given the opportunity to express what they want from their students. This restricts the understanding between the students and the teacher of what the course is centered around, as it is impossible to tell what kind of class a teacher will teach by only the name of the course and perhaps a short description. With a teacher-design project, the student will have the opportunity to learn more about their teacher, while their teacher can learn about them in return, adjusting their teaching method to best fit a class.

In conclusion, while some may argue a student-designed project is beneficial to their creativity and to what they want to learn, nowhere does it specify whether or not this project will be supervised by a teacher. This lack of supervision leads to the possibility of more issues than benefits seen with student-designed projects. It is true that the student-designed projects might turn out to be both well-executed and planned projects, but it is just as likely that they become the opposite. Even if some students turn in work indicative of the success they wish to achieve in class, others will fall behind and the class will be harmed as a result of these projects. Students need the supervision of a teacher, or else risk missing out on the opportunity for projects with the expectations of a high quality education, a strong focus on relevant material, and the establishment of a connection between the teacher and their class.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
8FC5C278EFCF,"Summer projects should be teacher designed because it would be a much neater process than having student designed ones. When you have a project made by a teacher you have a rubric that makes it easier. When you have a student designed project it has a rubric but its very different than the on that would be for a teacher designed one because all the students won't have the same project prompt they will all have different types of projects because they would all get to choose their own prompts and they will all have a different quality to them that can vary across many different subjects unlike one that is teacher designed which can be one or two different subjects which make it easier to keep the grading process less taxing on the teachers. An example that comes directly from my life s that for English we had to write a paper and it could ve anything that we waned but the teacher had to approve it and most people got approved of right away but a small amount of people had to do different ones because they were not approve which made it harder form them because it was a thing they were not really interested in which made they grade lower than it could have been because my grade was low for a paper in that class because I choose a bad thing that did not have enough info about it online but if that was a teacher designed project than I feel like would have done better on that paper than I did do

Another example of this working is the writing sol because it only has a small amount of prompts to keep people from getting the same one every year and it gives variety for the students doing it. Having a teacher designed one is also easier because it gives you a clear cut view of what needs to be done and how to get it done and what resources that you need to get it done unlike a student designed one because then you would have to research something to do than you have to get that topic approved by the teacher and tan you have to do the project but if your topic gets denied than you have to do the process all over again.

FA138B97C15F,"Did you know some schools require students to do projects over their break in summer? They are required to complete specific projects, even though it is summer time, for the schools to make sure students are still continuing to learn and grow. With that being said, it is very important to decide whether the projects should be student- designed or teacher-designed. I agree that summer projects for student should be teacher-designed because teachers have more experience with teaching, and because they are more aware of what students need to work on.

Experience is the key to a lot of things in life. Like becoming a teacher, it is the experience that genuinely makes someone a teacher. Therefor, summer projects for students should always be teacher-designed because teachers know the best for what should be assigned for students to complete. They would know what is too hard for them to complete, and certainly, what is too easy. With teachers being in charge of designing the projects, students will be more familiar with the process of completing the projects because they have been assigned projects and tasks from teachers all year long. Also, after many researching and studying, in 2015, researchers came up with the conclusion that the students that were assigned projects designed by teachers, were much more prepared for the upcoming school year, than the students that worked on the student-designed projects.

Last but not least, the required projects for students to complete over the summer, should be teacher-designed and not student-designed because teachers are more aware of what students need more practice on. Summer is meant to relax and have fun, but it is always beneficial for student to get associated with school work, even a little, to continue learning and becoming more and more bright. With that being said, a teachers goal is to always help students; so the projects designed by teachers will be assured to not waste a students time. In fact, they will learn beyond what they are required, and students will also be more informed towards some topics that they will going to need for their next school year.

Although, at the end of the day, students connect to each other better than teachers do. Summer projects being designed by students will be much more interesting and fun for students to complete. Students understand how other students do not want to do school work over the summer, so a student-designed project will be more interesting and less challenging! However, this way, the projects will be less informative. Meaning students will not only waste their time, but they will also be less prepared for school when it starts again. As mentioned before, teacher-designed projects will only have a positive impact on students for their own good due to teachers experience of teaching.

In conclusion, the required summer projects should be teacher-designed and not student-designed because of the teacher's experiences, and their understanding of what will have a more positive outcome on a student. regardless of the project being student or teacher-designed, students are required to do summer projects either way. That is why it is very important for the projects to be teacher-designed so it will have a more positive outcome for the student's education. Lastly, speak up to your school about how important it is to have summer projects designed by teachers. It is never too late, so make sure you make education over the summer for students a more effective type of learning,",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8

That being said, I believe that if students had to complete an assignment over summer break, it should be student-designed. This would give them the opportunity to show their creativity, knowledge, and work ethic.

Students who are able to choose their own assignment would be able to express their creativity how they believe it would fit. A portion of students could be excellent drawers, or just find enjoyment in drawing, and find that they want to do a project that they could express their drawing abilities. Others may find that they are more crafty and choose to do a sculpture of a significant scene in a book that they read. Students who are able to choose their own project can make it seem more interesting to them, given that they could make it how they want. Some may believe that having a teacher-designed project would be better, but not everyone would get to show their creative abilities. Creativity is an important factor that goes into making a project great.

Second, students that get to pick their own project, would be able to show their strength of knowledge that they have learned throughout the years. This would be able to help them create something extraordinary and impress themselves and their teachers. Being able to express your knowledge can show someone how far you have come in your education and what you are still weak in. Finding your weaknesses is an important aspect and can help you grow as a person both inside and outside of school. Students that get to pick their own projects would be able to make it challenging for themselves. People may think that having a teacher-designed project would be more fair to everyone, but I believe that everyone's knowledge is different, so allowing them to design their projects would accompany their knowledge best. Thus, being able to express their knowledge is another important component in allowing students to pick their own project.

Last, having students choose their own projects would help show their work ethic. By allowing them to choose their projects, it can aid them in allowing them to choose an assignment that they could finish in a couple of days, or challenge themselves and make a thorough project. Students, that I have seen, that get to pick their own projects are usually more ecstatic about making them above their expectations and have fun with it. This can also help them in managing their time wisely by being able to both finish the project and have fun during summer break. Some think that students should be given teacher-designed projects over the break so they will be more encouraged to finish them. I believe that if students are given a choice in what they want to do for their project, that it gives them more motivation to work on it and continue to make it better. Showing work ethic in an assignment is also an important aspect to allowing them to choose their own projects.

Overall, I believe that allowing students to make their own project shows their creativity, knowledge, and work ethic. Not only do they get to make it all of the above things, but they also get to have fun with it. Sometimes not everyone enjoys the assigned projects that they are given by their teacher, so this allows them to get to expand the horizon and make it their own. Therefore, I believe that if students are given a project over summer break, it should be student-designed. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
77A579CB2F86,"Summer break the longest break during the year from school. this is the time you decompress and forget everything you learned from the year prior before your head gets crammed with more information. requiring students to complete summer activities would help students keep all of the information from the prior year in their brain to give them a better chance to have a better start to the next school year. These summer assignments should be teacher-designed to promote better learning conditions.

Teacher designed summer activities would help students in the long run. this would keep their brain thinking and remembering the curriculum from the previous school year. A teacher could design a summer project that would help reinforce what the students learned. the teacher could use projects like a book report or a lab report on a experiment students would have to complete over the summer. a teacher designed project would insure maximum learning is still happening outside of the school environment. This would support the students learning for the next school year by keeping the brain thinking about the information and not to forget it.

One of the biggest problems in school today is that students come back from winter break and have forgotten all of the things that they learned the prior year. Teachers could assign projects that must be completed for a grade in the next school year to ensure students completed this activity. teachers would have the ability to help students over the summer by way of internet learning.

This would give students a way to still ask the teachers questions and get help on assignments while they are working over the summer. if the teacher assigned a project like a science project or experiment the student would still be able to reach out to the teacher and get directions from them. They could also make lessons in videos that that the students would be able to watch and help as a review for what they learned in the prior year.

On the other side of the table students would absolutely hate the idea of having to do school work on their summer break. The summer break is when students get to decompress hang out with friends and family. This would also make a problem for families trying to go on vacation. Summer activities could also be made by students which would make them more exciting and make the students want to complete it more. Students could create assignments that would interest them and they could make them group work so that the students could work together with their friends. This could positively benefit the students in the long run but this would most likely require schools to give every student a personal laptop which some school districts cant afford.

Having students complete summer activities that are teacher made would help the students remember what they learned in the prior year. This would help students retain more information than if they just had a whole summer off with no work. Studetns would hate this because they just want to have the summer away from school but teacher made assignements would help students in the long run. Summer assignments should be teacher-designed to promote better learning conditions. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
E9E9AEC9100C,"Student should designed the summer project because it gives them more freedom, more experience and it is life-changing.

However, not everyone would agree with this position. Some people may argue that teacher should designed the summer project. For example it challenging and you will learn more. Nevertheless, there are other viewpoint to consider.

To begin with, it gives you more freedom. For example, in India there was a kid named Generic_Name, sometime when the teacher was not in the class room. He always help his class mates, one day his teacher give them a project and he decide to do a toy little rocket, also he decide to test the rocket and it worked. And now he win the grand winner award by the President of India.

In addition, it gives you more experience. For example, in schools teacher are the one who do all the work, and if a student did not do his work, it will be a waste of time for the student and the teacher. If we allow student to make their own work they will know how hard is also they gain experience by doing the project by them self.

Finally, it is life-changing. For example, in Generic_City schools they have to take every class every year and some extra load on the top. But expert for one thing it was summer school project, because they want their student to relay on their self not on the others. Sometime when you do the work on your own, you known how hard is the work and you will more learn by the work you did in the end.

If we allow the student to do their work on their self. They will know how hard is it and they will force their self to the limit to do better at ever thing they do, also it gain more experience to do it right and freedom to think of an idea they have and life-changing is the one put it to together in the end to make it better.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
92BA1245F66C,"The reason why the summer project should be student-designed, because the student would be interested,and their knowledge about things would expand. They would researching about their topic,and things they want to know more about, when they learn new facts they would apply it to their everyday life. The summer project would keep their knowledge fresh for the next year.

The topic the the teacher gives you maybe boring, so students don't feel like doing it that is not fair to the kids were you are not allowed to chose your own topic. It keep the student busy. Doesn't allow them to sit around the house playing video games and watching television. Maybe the assignment has to with them being outside like: watching people play basketball,football,walk their pets. In third grade there was this project they we had to do over the summer, were I had to walk around my neighborhood to count how many car were different colors, then we had to make a bar graph to see the percentage. then we had to look up what color car gets pulled over more, and come to find out red cars get pulled over more than any other car. The decisions, were the student or teacher should design the summer project. The student should be allowed to design the summer project, because you want student to be engage and willing to succeed and prosper throughout the project and through life.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
DDF94CF384FD,"Learning over summer break is typically not ideal for students, but some classes do require it. Students procrastinate and avoid the summer projects because they want to enjoy their break, not spend it working on something for school. They do know themselves best, and therefore they should be able to design their own projects before summer to make it easier for them to do the project. I think summer projects should be student-designed to make it easier for students to get the work done and learn from it. With a bit of help from teachers, students would be able to design projects that they know would be the easiest and best way for them to learn over summer break.

Summer break is a precious time for students. They get to relax away from school, spend time with friends, and enjoy a stress-free 3 months. If they were able to design the projects they have to do over this cherished time, I can say that most of them would not avoid it as much. I believe students would not procrastinate on something they have specifically tailored for their own learning capabilities. Whenever I have a project assigned that is made by a teacher in a way that I do not learn easily through, I procrastinate on it and put off getting it done. As a student, I love summer break, and I would not want to do a project that I know I will not enjoy.

Every student learns differently. We do not receive or process information the same way. If students were to create their own projects, they would be able to make something that they know they can learn from. True, teachers can see what students struggle with and what they should be learning, but they cannot know how the student works mentally. Only the student can truly know themselves. When teachers assign projects with product options such as art, writing, acting, or others, I find it rather nice. I can choose what I know I will be able to do and get it done faster, as opposed to a project where I cannot choose what I do. This personalized learning is a much better experience for students than all students being treated like they think the same way. We are all human beings who are very different individuals.

Teachers may think they should be the ones to design these projects since they know the curriculum and have probably seen what projects seem to have worked in the the past. However, the world changes, people change, and learning should change with it. Students should be able to make projects that work just right for them, and if they have the help of a teacher to do it, then it could be just perfect. It has always been beneficial when a teacher has worked with me to help me do an assignment the way I am able to do it. Teachers could help students create these assignments to make a great learning activity each individual. Teachers know the learning material, and students know themselves. Put them together and you get a project that is not too hard, not too easy, but just right.

To conclude, I think summer projects should be student-designed to make it easier for the students to get their work done. Student-designed projects would be much easier on the students' break time, giving them the stress-free vacation they deserve, preventing them from procrastinating on their work. Along with this, no one knows a student better than themselves. We are all very different people, and with help from teachers and their knowledge of the subject, we can make a project just for ourselves that can help us really learn what we need to learn over the summer break. I think this is the best approach for summer projects, and it should be the way to go.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
B628FF1A07C6,"Relaxing poolside on a sunny day after going for a swim in the cool water. Most summer days can be drawn up to this scenario, but as kids grow older they start to become accountable for Summer assignments. Schools find these assignments necessary in order for students to experience some sort of learning while they are not attending school.

Although, it is difficult to decide whether assignments designed by students or teachers would be more beneficial to prepare for the upcoming school year. Summer assignments should be teacher-designed so that students are familiar with next year topics, students are not worried about coming up with their own assignments, and teachers are able to assess students accordingly.

People would argue that Summer assignments should be student-designed because some students get away with not doing any work when they are designed by teachers. The issue with teacher-designed assignments is that they tend to be the same to give everyone equal opportunity, so students reach out to others to get answers to the assignments and do not actually work out the questions themselves. However, while it may seem like a problem for students to 'cheat' on their assignments it is not that big of a deal because it is not during the actual school year. Also, even if students are just copying down answers they can still retain knowledge from seeing the answers and connecting them to the questions. Understanding how to get the answer or where it comes from still helps students problem solve and interact with the question.

To start off with, Summer assignments should be teacher-designed to let students be comfortable with upcoming topics. For instance, a math student who is going into their second year of Algebra receives a packet covering topics they learned in their first year of Algebra because they carry into the second year. Lessons can always connect to something students have been taught in the past, whether it be yesterday or years ago. With these assignments teachers can provide students with problems highlighting what information is most valuable to remember going into the next year. It is very helpful for students to have a clear objective of what they need to work or focus on.

Moving on, Summer assignments should be teacher-designed so students do not have to stress about finding their own idea. For example, if the assignment is to read a book over the break and the teacher assigns their students read a specific one so they can teach lessons based on that book during the school year. Having the teacher assign certain books or give a few options helps students by reducing their selection and might make it easier than choosing from a wide variety.

During the Summer most kids want to focus on traveling or spending time with friends, so the less they have to think about school the better. With this solution, all students have to do is read the book while teachers get to test students however they like with the lessons regarding the book.

Finally, Summer assignments should be teacher-designed to let teachers assess each student's skills. For instance, if an English teacher gives their students the same writing assignment then they are able to see the difference in how each student handles that sort of task. Teachers can tell a lot about their students from their work like how they approach the given task, their assets, their disadvantages, and how much effort they put in. It will assist in teachers' decisions on what they need to teach or focus on to help students improve individually and overall.

In conclusion, teachers should design Summer assignments so that students can be familiar with upcoming topics, not worry about finding their own assignments, and teachers can assess students' skills accordingly. I encourage schools to let their Summer assignments be teacher-designed so that students can be prepared for the next school year.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
CE9CD7275C9F,"As a student growing up I've always wondered what it would be like if I could make my own summer project; instead of my teachers always making them. When it comes to summer projects, many people dispute whether or not, should students design said projects or should the teachers. If students designed their own summer projects they'd only pick what they're good at. They wouldn't pick what they struggle with, like a teacher would, so you can better yourself for the next level.

Me personally, I would say summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers pick what you need to work on to improve yourself, they actually know the curriculum and what you need to know for the following year, and they give you the work to help you; not to hurt you.

See, teachers actually know the curriculum and what they're teaching; so when they assign you these summer projects they're just trying to prepare you for the next step. When they give you all this extra work, or at least what seems like extra work, they are just doing it to prepare you for what comes next. Teachers just want to see you do better and use what you learned from them to excel at the next stage. Summer projects are used for teachers to gauge what you learned from them and to see if you can use it on ""foreign"" material that you've never seen before. They do this because they want to see you win.

Another thing for why I say that these summer projects should be teacher designed is because when create these things; they pick what you need to better yourself. Like for instance one time when I was in the 6th grade going to the 7th grade; my teacher assigned me this big summer project. Everyone else in my class didn't have to anything as big, they all got little miniature projects to do. At first I thought my teacher was doing it out of spite and hatred for me. I almost started crying, but then I asked her when school was over, why my packet was one of the biggest ones out of everyone else. She looked at me and said the only reason my packet was one of the biggest in the class was because she believed in me and I was one of the smartest kids in the class; and that I could actually complete the whole thing if I put my mind to it. I almost agreed with her but then I asked how come I can't have a smaller one and she told me I could choose if I wanted to do this one or make a smaller one for myself. I almost went along with that for a second, but then I thought about just because I could pick what I wanted to work on, would that really benefit me in the long run. After I sat and thought about that for a second I just decided to roll with bigger packet because all my teacher was trying to do was help me better myself for the next level.

The final reason for why I say teachers should be the ones to design the summer projects is because they give you the work to help you, not to hurt you. I only say this because why would a teacher intentionally give you work they know you can't do unless they know you can do it if you put your mind to it. The only reason they give out summer projects is to help you. All this extra work is used to benefit you in every way possible. I used to think it was used to just make us not be able to have a fun summer; until I actually sat down and did it and then by the time the new school year came around, I already knew all the stuff they were teaching for the first semester.

So, in conclusion when it comes to summer projects, let students tell it, they should be the ones to design it. But, all in all teachers should be the ones to design it because they do it to benefit you in the long run, they know what you'll need for the next year, and last but not least they pick what you need to become a better you. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
10049349777A,"It is important for students to continue learning over summer because they are out of school for a couple months. By assigning a project/projects, this continues their education while on break. It should be up to the teachers to design projects because it gives students a good idea on what they should be doing, so students do not struggle with finding a topic/idea on what to do. Teachers assigning a project can also contribute to lead students to learn material that will help them for their new classes when school starts back up. Most teacher-designed projects will give students options on what they could do for it. Having a student-designed project may lead to extra stress, not knowing what to do, and students forgetting about it or giving up.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed so students have a good idea on what they should be doing for their project. Most summer projects are teacher-designed so students do not have to struggle with figuring out what it should be on. For example, if there was a student who was going to head into an AP Language Arts class for their junior year, a teacher should design a project by giving an outline on what their project should be like. If a student were to design a project without the help from a teacher it could be hard and a struggle for students, to figure out what it should be on. With the help from a teacher to design a project students are more likely to succeed on it.

Another factor in a teacher designing a project would be, giving students a majority of options. This would be helpful for students so, they do not have to think long and hard about what their project should be on. Including this for a teacher-designed outline could be a very helpful factor when students have to pick what it should be on. For example, if a student were to do a project for science and they have to study something for Biology, having options on what they should study and look for while creating a project would be helpful and easy on the students. Having a teacher design a project will also contribute when leading students on the track to what they are going to learn about in the new school year.

Having a teacher-designed project can contribute to students having to do a project that will be an overview for what they will be learning in the new school year. Students should have a little insight on what they will be learning in their new class. An example of this would be, a student who decided to take Astronomy, this student has no idea what he will be learning about in this class. A teacher designs a project so that students can learn a little about this class before they enter it, by creating a research project. This will contribute to students learning about the class because they will have to read about Astronomy, find sources, and more. If a student were to design their own project it could lead to it being not enough, them barely learning anything, and just being not really complete, how a teacher might of wanted it.

If students were held accountable for designing a project there are many downsides. Students tend to not always complete or even start summer projects. This is why many teachers design their own projects so it puts pressure on the students to complete it. Some students rush near the end of summer and during the beginning of the school year to complete it. Students are young and although some can be responsible and accountable for what they are told to do, a minority continue each year not willing or try to do their summer projects. Having a teacher-designed project will help students complete it as told, by giving students a good idea on what they should do for their project, have a majority of options on what they could do, and help contribute to lead students to learn material for their new classes when the school year starts. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
A41AAD3F632D,"Summer break for teachers and students is a great resting period to rejuvenate for the next, upcoming school year. Students are not overwhelmed by the constant workload, while teachers get a well-deserved break from planning. Concerned individuals, such as parents and teachers, believe that during this two-month-break, students do not continue to learn or keep their minds fresh with knowledge. Due to this, most schools give out packets and other tedious work to keep students busy on their time off. Some schools even require students to do summer projects to be sure they will continue to learn outside of school. These projects could possibly be teacher-designed or student-designed. Students should complete summer projects that are student-designed because it promotes creativity, students will be more likely to complete them, and it will allow them to be more engaged in something that interests them.

However, there are some people who may disagree with this point of view because teacher-designed projects would be more specific and perhaps more relevant to that teacher's class subject. if summer projects were teacher-designed, teachers would have the opportunity to provide students with project guidelines to prevent them from feeling overwhelmed or discouraged. Guidelines for these projects would narrow topics down and give the student a better understanding of what his or her project should consist of. Nevertheless, student-designed summer projects would be highly conducive to students because they would allow them to have the freedom to exemplify creativity and give them the chance to think outside of the box.

Allowing the assigned projects to be student-designed would promote the creativity of all students. Being that it is summer, the students should be able to have fun and look forward to their projects rather than feel overwhelmed by them. If the projects are designed by the students, they would have no choice but to plan out and execute their project plans to the best of their ability. This forces their minds to fully think and map out their assignments to know how they would like them to turn out. Because of this, students would have to engage in various research activities which is a vital life skill and would be further conducive to them. In my English class, I was assigned a summative project on the topic of global problems and I was left to come up with a local solution. The choice of the global problem was up to me and I was urged to come up with my own effective local solution. After making a decision and solving it locally how I saw best fit, I had to display this somehow, whether it was by an advertisement, radio podcast, TV commercial, etc. It was all up to me and I had complete freedom to choose something that was really important to me. This was really motivating to me because I was genuinely passionate and interested in the topic of my choosing. Providing students with a creative outlet when doing work can grab their attention and spark an interest ultimately causing them to score higher on assignments.

Students will be more likely to do the projects if they have the option to design them. Teacher-designed projects could discourage a lot of students from completing them due to a lack of motivation or interest. A lot of the time, students are assigned summer homework, whether it be reading, writing, or math packets. Although teachers make these assignments mandatory to be completed and turned in on the first day, the sad reality is: most students don't have their assignments done on time for the returning school year. This is because the students are not interested, let alone engaged. The teacher-designed summer assignments allow no room for fun or creativity that sparks an interest in children, therefore the assignments do not get done. In 7th and 8th grade, me and my peers were asked to do summer break reading logs and summaries. We were allotted the full, two-month-break to fully and thoroughly complete them, yet on the first day of school, hardly anyone had brought them in for credit. This was simply because they did not care enough to have them done over the summer. While students may do their work when school is in session, it does not guarantee they will do it during break. The more creative freedom given to them to do these assignments, the higher the chances are of them getting completed.

If students are actually interested in their projects, they will be more engaged and have higher quality work. Every student is passionate about something and if they are given the opportunity to showcase what is is they're passionate about, the work would be remarkable. It is a proven fact that students learn better when they are truly interested and fascinated by the curriculum. Being engaged also allows students to expand their knowledge. Learning becomes fun to a student when they care about the things being taught, and when learning becomes fun, students desire to know more to develop a higher understanding of what it is they are fascinated with.

Providing students with the chance to be creative and design their own projects will, overall, be what is best for them. They will get the opportunity to excel due to a genuine interest in the projects of their choice. Students will feel less overwhelmed and stressed by work designed by their teachers and will feel more motivated to complete the assignments given to them. Summer break for students is a time to feel stress-free and relaxed before returning back the following year. The projects given during that time should be a way to express their creativity and also be a fun way to learn more about something. The best way to keep a student engaged over the summer is by letting he or she choose an area of interest and letting them explore as much as possible. Student-designed projects are the best way to make sure students continue learning and growing over the long summer break. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
3FEB1129B8D7,"Summer projects should be teacher-designed because, students can enjoy their summer break without any stress, teachers are making things like posters for the new school year, and school staff wanted students to have a long good break until some day in August of each year. For example, if students were given a summer project it would ruin their summer break and makes some kids angry.

Teachers would have to help their school have more decorations and make their school hallways look nicer. The teachers would also learn things they have to teach students what is it about and students can put their brains at a high level of knowledge once they come back from summer break.

In conclusion, teachers should do summer projects to support their school because, students would not have to deal with work during their summer break, the school would be ready for the first day after summer break, and getting students ready to learn something new when their summer break is over.",1,Summer projects,Independent,0.0
D25C3B9925E3,"Summer projects are not always fun to do but to make them fun they should be student-designed. Teacher-designed projects for the summer are really boring and most people dread doing projects in the summer. Although teacher-designed projects are less creative, student-designed projects are more creative. Students should design projects for the summer because the projects will be more creative, they will be fun to do in the summer, and the students will be more interested in doing the projects.

Students should design the projects because they will be more creative than Teacher-designed projects. For example, if a teacher were to hand out a project, there would be certain things that you would have to follow in order to get a good grade on it. If it were a student-designed project it would have follow a guide line to make sure it is on topic. Another example, every year in elementary school teachers would give a checklist for how many books you read. Students don't want to do that at all but if teachers told the to keep track of what they did through out the summer that might be fun. Students should design the projects because students are more creative than adults and can come up with projects that are fun for them.

Students should design the projects because they can come up with fun idea's for a project. For example, instead of reading a certain amount of books for a grade, they can set a challenge goal like trying to see who could swim the fastest in a certain amount of time, they can record how much tropical foods they have eaten. Another example, when summer starts students can keep record of how many miles they walked or ran. Students can keep track of how many miles they traveled in the summer and at the beginning of the school year they can see who traveled the most and Whoever had the most can get a special prize. Students should design the projects because the students would have a lot more fun doing the project.

Students should design the projects for the summer because they will have more interest doing the projects. For example, if teachers were to design the projects students wouldn't want to really do them. The students would want to do something they're interested in, not an assignment from the teacher for the summer. Another example, Students are interested in what they're doing because they want to. When teachers make the projects they want you to get a good grade but they really don't care if you are enjoying it. Students should design the projects because while they are getting a good grade on them, they are also interested in what they are doing.

In conclusion, Students should design the projects because they can enjoy doing the project, they can have fun while doing the project, and also they can be really creative when they need to do a project they're interested in. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
F983FFA8BB50,"Majority of students that attend school are assigned a project over the summer to assure they continue learning during their break. Those projects that are assigned are teacher-designed or sometimes, student-designed. Students argue that summer projects are better off being designed by themselves. Projects assigned over the summer are beneficial being teacher-designed because teachers have knowledge on what the students need to continue learning.

First, when students go on summer break, their main focus is getting a break away from school. When allowing teachers to design the projects, it makes a promise that students will have all of the right knowledge; The teachers design the project long enough so the students can gain enough knowledge to continue learning. Giving the student an opportunity to design their project only means they will design the easiest task. When students are put in charge of designing their project, they have a chance of getting off topic and not doing it over the summer.

Second, students have been with their teachers the entire school year. Teachers get to know their students and know what they are capable of doing. Not all students have the same learning capability, therefore, the teachers might not give a student a hard designed project. When the student is in charge of designing their project, they might design a project that they think they can do, but the teacher could disagree. Teachers are doing their students a favor and analyzing them to create a well designed project fit for their knowledge capability.

Some may say, students are better off designing their own project because they know what will be best for themselves over the summer. That student-designed projects will give students a window of opportunity to show their maturity on creating a project. However, not every student has that maturity level or creativity level to design a project that meets their teachers standards. Majority of students rely on teachers to design something for them that would best fit their criteria to continue learning.

In conclusion, teacher-designed projects assigned over the summer are more beneficial to students. Teachers have knowledge on how long a project should be so the students cannot make them shorter for their own benefit. Students do not realize how much a teacher benefits them in analyzing what the student needs to continue learning. Projects that are assigned over the summer should be teacher-designed.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
E06A8C8B5666,"I think that a summer project should really be designed by the teacher. However, there could be a exception if the student had a good idea. I do think that this would be a good idea, it would help keep students out of trouble and keep them from getting bored. If the projects are designed by the teacher then they will be alot better.

However if the teacher does come up with the project, there should be a few diffrent choices for the students to pick. For one if the students are able to find one that they have intrest in, the project will be alot better for both the teacher and the student. If the student has intrest in the project, it will actually be benifital to them.

So say the student came up with a good idea for a summer project. I think that the teacher should allow for he or she to proceed in that project and maybe let the idea become more open to the other students. If the student comes up with a project they would like to do, well most likely they would have good intrest in the project and actually get something out of it.

Me personaly, I would probably come up with my own idea for a project. Because, most likely if I come up with something I want to wright about, then I will most likely sucssed and do well. For one, I will have plenty of ideas and will actually be interested in doing it.

So i think, this would be a good idea if the teachers came up with the ideas. But, like i said before if the students have a good idea they come up with, then it needs to be given and approved by the teacher. Because, if the students come up with the ideas and there not teacher approved, then who knows what it will be about. Please, consider thinking about my idea.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
EAAF750723A4,"During summer break, most kids will not use a lot of their time for learning. A way to change this is for schools to require students to complete summer projects. At Generic_School, students are not required to complete any work over summer break. If Generic_School started to assign projects over the summer, they should be teacher-designed. Reasons for this include more on-topic work, easy grading, and assessing the students.

Summer projects that are assigned should be created by the teachers and assign the same or similar project to all students. This way, students are doing work that is relevant to their curriculum and is worth doing. If the projects were designed by students, students could potentially pick a topic that is irrelevant to learning, and does not relate to what the teacher would want. An example of this is a research project. If students were allowed to choose whatever they want for their project, it is possible that some students create a project that is not relevant to learning. If teachers assigned a broad topic for students to choose from, it would help regulate the project more to make sure that students are staying on topic and learning. These projects could potentially tie in to what students will be learning next year. If this is the case, having a teacher-designed project will help students get a head start on the curriculum for the next school year.

If schools are assigning projects to kids over the summer, it is most likely that they will be graded. With a teacher-designed project, it will be easier and quicker for teachers to assess the projects that were made by the students. For example, if there was one or two set projects that were teacher-created, the grading process would be simpler than having a range of very different projects that were student-designed. This also allows teachers to grade off a rubric easier, since there are set objectives that students need to complete. This also makes it easier for the students to complete the project, since they will have a clearer understanding of what to do for their project, instead of coming up with their own. If a student creates their own project, it will be hard for them to know exactly what to include and how much to do. It is possible they could go off a rubric, but this is not as practical.

Another reason that summer projects should be teacher-designed is that it can help teachers know where students are academically placed and find out what students already know. This is similar to a pre-test that teachers often give to test the students knowledge of a topic. If the teacher assigns an English project, it might give the teacher an idea on how good that student is at writing an essay or doing a research project. This lets teachers know if a certain student might need help during the year, or if a student is already capable of performing well in the class. This gives a good reason for a school to assign a summer project, because it will benefit the teachers and the students.

Giving a summer project is not something that I have ever gotten in the past. If I were to have been assigned one, I would like it to be from a teacher. This would help me complete the project easier. With all the reasons stated above, this is how summer projects should be assigned.    ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
640899CC6EC5,"Should summer projects be student or teacher-designed?

Generic_City has some of the smartest and extremely qualified staff in the nation. The teachers in this county have degrees from some of the most prestigious universities in America. Teachers are always prepared to teach the curriculum to the best of their abilities. Partially due to their efforts we have some of the highest

SAT

and exam scores in the nation. It would only make sense for teachers to design a project that they think would be beneficial to all new incoming students based on their experience through prior years. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers can base them around the their curriculum and needs of the upcoming class.

With teacher-designed summer projects teachers can give work they believe is most appropriate and beneficial for their curriculum during the school year. During the school year, the teacher is the individual who creates the worksheets and teaches the new course work, so who's better to prepare from than the source itself. Students taking that class should be prepared by having an overview of the new course work from the teacher. Teachers are familiar to the little basics most students forget coming into their class from previous years therefore, they incorporate the extra practice into the summer assignments and/or projects.

Teachers have a better insight on the students coming into their class the next year. Every class is different, a group of students may have a weakness in a certain unit that maybe the previous class didn't. Teachers can look at the previous year average grades of the new incoming class and tweak and adjust the projects based on the needs of the majority of incoming students. Teachers are able to talk to other teachers to get an insight on the students coming in during the fall and therefore, able to create a project or assignment that is most beneficial to all students.

Granted, there are times student-designed assignments are beneficial because sometimes teachers may not fully realize or understand the students need more preparation for a specific skill to thrive in their class. Alumni students can help by giving a better insight on the subjects that should be brushed up on. Although, this can be very beneficial to some students who learn a similar way, others may not have an issue with that specific topic or skill. It may be a strength for them and they would just be wasting their time on one specific skill when they could be working on a weakness of theirs. To avoid bias in summer assignments it is best to leave the assignments for teachers to create since they give more of an overview of the topics and generally don't go in depth on one specific skill but still prepare students enough to where they know what they'll be learning in their class.

Summer assignments should be teacher assigned to eliminate bias from students and receive work that is beneficial to all students. Teachers have connections with other staff members to make sure the incoming class is prepared and have all the basics down to thrive in their class during the new school year. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9B15C49AAF99,"Summer projects are a fantastic idea for students to be able to learn over their break. Although having a teacher design these projects would be beneficial in making sure the students are learning the correct material, it would be more efficient if the students were allowed to design the projects themselves. Therefore, summer projects should be student-designed as it well allow for students not only to enjoy what they are learning, but also allows them to use their own strengths to understand better.

Allowing a student to design their own project will change their attitude from if it was created by a teacher; furthermore, accomplishing it will make them feel even more proud. If the project was designed by the teacher, students will think that it will be boring, long before even seeing what the requirements are. Moreover, if the students were allowed to create their own project they would make it as enjoyable as they can, so they wouldn't have to dread working on it. By giving students the opportunity to create their own project, they will be more erratic to initiate it.

Also, students will be able to create a project that will allow them to use their strengths instead of their weaknesses when it comes to learning. Students have different strengths in ways of learning from one another; for example, some students learn better with visuals while others learn better from texts. By allowing students to design their own projects it will allow them to learn using their strengths, which can result in leading to an exposure of new ideas for the teacher to implement. Students being able to design their own project would help have a better understanding of the material that they are working on.

Student-designed projects will help boost a students morale toward the project and be able to have a better understanding of what they are learning. Student-designed projects will help focus on one student's understanding, rather than a teacher-designed project that focuses on every student's understanding. Summer projects are beneficial for learning, but would be more efficient if projects were created by the students.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
8103AD07727E,"Over summer there is a multitude of things students want to do. None of these things are school related. Yet at the end of each school year teachers give out a summer project to these students, expecting it to be done by the start of next school year. Some times the project is to read a book other times it is to watch a movie, but sometimes it is to wright an essay or create a piece of art. All of this is assigned for a three month break, and usually a student receives a project like this from all of his or her teachers. Most these project will take 3-4 days to complete. That is around one month of summer dedicated to doing school work. How can this be made easier for students? If teachers made it simpler! Teachers should design summer projects because having predetermined topics will shorten the length of the project, project topics will be related to bettering students lives outside of academics, and topics of a similar subject will encourage student to communicate over summer.

While some people believe that students should design these projects by themselves. Citing that it will help the students to learn more and they are more likely to be enthusiastic about his or hers own project. When students design there own project he or she can pick the subject, the method, even the form of presentation. Nevertheless, with such a broad variety of options, students could not receive credit from a teacher because there project did not have the proper category or criteria. This would lead to a student starting of the year with a low grade which could be difficult for he or she to raise depending on the grading scale.

Having a list of topics to choose from would shorten projects length by a large percent taking at the least the two to three day brain storming period away. This would give student more time to work on the project its self, and more time for he or she to do things they want to do. There is a lot of planning that goes in to summer by the students . Students sign up for trips to places all around the world other students sign up for summer jobs and some students stay home. By shortening the time it would take students to to finish there projects. Students would have more time to enjoy there break and take advantage of there much needed vacation.

When teachers design the summer project they can relate it to bettering students live outside of academics. An example being the gap between junior and senior year, most students will be doing one of three things; working at a job, working at a internship, or working on college visits. If teachers knowing that the following year the first thing students will be doing is to wright up a college essays. Making the project about researching your college of choice and finding there essay requirements. Students would be able to to do something that they already should have been working on, and with the incentive of a good grade students would put more effort in to finding this information about his or her school of choice. In other summers students can be encouraged to get internships and have jobs over summer to help set students up for the world out side of academics. By having the project relate to life outside academics teachers can help student complete projects that already relate to bettering there lives and setting them on track for a wonder full and productive life.

When student are all given choices from the same list then there topics will be similar, this will encouraging the possibility of group work. There is a large range of advantages to group work, especially, over summer. Group work can help students when they are all reading the same book or drafting the same essay. It gives students a outlet to brainstorm together and bounce ideas of each other. This can help students to grow and strengthen there ability to socialize, be criticized, and even to compromise. Group work will also help the students who are less likely to adventure of of the house during the summer months weather it is be because they are antisocial or just lazy the incentive of getting a better grade by talking to fellow class mates may encourage said students.

When teachers design project students are given more time to be them selves, more time to gain experience out side of academics, and are even encouraged to work in groups which helps students to grow as people. Summer is a vital time to teenagers and teachers should not create obstacles to take away from this important time students get to be them selves.  ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
318C3D719F7C,"To maintain a healthy, active mind, many students are assigned an educational, summer-long project.

These assignments vary from science experiments to maintaining a reading log; anything that would keep kids busy on their summer-long vacation.

However, there is the question of if these summer assignments should be created by teachers or by the students themselves.

To create the optimal educational experience, summer projects should be self-administered so that they are individualized for every student, so they are easy to manage, and so students can learn how to be self-sufficient.

Providing students with the opportunity to take control of their own summer project makes the assignment more individualized.

Compare the idea of assigning a summer project to the scenario of a student choosing their classes; they are much more likely be perform well in a subject of their interest than in a random class enforced upon them.

Relating this back to summer projects, students tend to better commit to a project that aligns with their interests.

Also, Students are more motivated when they have control over their decisions.

When people take a personal initiative towards what they do, they carry more pride and are more successful in their work.

Personalization of summer projects produce more meaningful experiences that serve as a solid foundation for education.

As students are away from school for a long three months, there is no other person better than the students themselves to manage a personal project.

Teacher are not aware of the responsibilities or vacation plans of their students, so the expectations they would set might not be attainable for some students.

For example, a student would not be able to keep up with an at-home project if they were away for the majority of their summer.

Rather if they were to choose their own project, they could more easily manage how to carry out the project in consideration of their personal circumstance.

In general, students would be better at following their own judgment when creating and completing their own project.

Without any teachers to answer their questions over the summer, it is better for the students to be their own bosses.

If students were to create their own parameters for a summer-long project, it would be easier to manage because the students would be more knowledgeable of the requirements than if the project were assigned by a teacher.

Leaving a student to create and complete their own summer-long project would instill responsibility.

At an age of maturation, students need to learn how to be self-sufficient.

The responsibility of a summer-long project is comparable to that which is handled in the regular education students go through the other three seasons of the year.

Students must learn to make decisions for themselves in school as they would have to for a summer project.

A self-assigned project teaches many of the qualities innate to being an functioning adult.

Many people must work by their own deadlines to make a living.

Without responsiblity, which is taught be self-assigned summer projects, people would not be able to hold jobs to pay bills.

The long vacation over summer is a oppertune time to hone personal skills necessary to getting by and thriving in life.

.

Through a self-created project, students can best investigate their personal intersets by setting and managing their own goals while developing responsibility along the way.

When students can take it upon themselves to improve their education while on their summer break, they can find success and personal enrichment while still enjoying their vacation                                        ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
BA2E03C7A8F4,"In some schools, students are made to complete academic projects over summer break to retain the information they learned in the year. Weather or not they should be made to do these projects in the first place is a discussion in itself. Looking past that, some people believe students should create their own project, rather than the teacher. Presumably because the students may not be so hard on themselves when it comes to assigning a workload, and they may even have a little fun with it; however, the downside to this, of course, is that students do not necessarily know how to teach themselves. They may not create a project that challenges them in any way or helps them retain what they learned in school.

To begin, Many people would argue that students should not be forced to complete work over summer vacation; that being said, having students create their own project may make it feel less like work,and more like a fun activity, and if they are learning the material then who cares? The problem does become evident here, ""are students that create their own project actually learning what they need to?"", and they likely are not. It goes against a child, or teenagers nature to actually try in something like this. Majority of the students made to create a project would likely do the bare minimum, and nobody would learn anything valuable like that.

To continue, This does not mean the alternative is the best option. Both ideas have a plethora of pros and cons. Teachers are more likely to give you far too much work, and so much work that needs to be done during a period of relaxation may totally kill initiative, making a student not want to learn, even when school starts again. Teachers will inevitably reuse the same project for years on end, perhaps because they believe that it is still good material, or rather they are too lazy to create a new one each year. Either way, this does not help the students. The human mind is constantly evolving, and our knowledge of everything likewise, projects will quickly grow outdated, then even fewer people will get a quality education.

With all the negative aspects of each idea fighting one another in a battle over what is the worst one, a spectator can't help but wonder if we have strayed too far into the deep end when it comes to the education system. An argument over education should not be ""which of these ideas isn't god awful?"", but rather an argument over what is the better option. A reprisal of our nations education system is long overdue, it hardly works, but finding what does work is much easier said than done. Perhaps if there were an alternative option that did, it would be in place by now. Maybe the future generations will figure it all out, or maybe we are supposed to remain as the primitive apes we are today, perhaps that is never meant to change.

To conclude, when creating a project with the sole purpose of teaching someone about something, or how to do something, it is imperative that they know all the information that needs to be learned. This necessity would eliminate pretty much every student, simply because they are learning it. In the words of famed Gonzo journalist, Hunter Thompson, ""if something is worth doing, it's worth doing right"", and while the teachers may overdo it, and they most likely will not understand how much it pains the student to do their work over break, they need to create the projects. The teachers also need to be sure that the information they are teaching alligns with the times, no lazyness should be tolerated. A middle ground needs to be reached, with a mix of fun and important learning material. Perhaps, the students and teachers could work together when creating a project, that way a nice middle ground could be achieved. This would have to be a yearly thing with each new class, so the information in the projects would also be updated yearly. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
619D4176B04A,"With summer break comes the joy of sleeping in and spending the day with friends, allowing students to be free from the stress that school may cause them. However, as students enjoy their freedom, they end up losing the knowledge they have carefully built up over the course of the school year. To combat this issue, some schools have implemented summer projects that students must complete over the course of their summer break. The issue with the mandatory summer projects is whether or not they should be designed by the students or by the teachers. Some may argue that student-designed projects are more beneficial, but teacher-designed projects ensures that the project's purpose is fulfilled and that student can receive the help they need.

While it can be said that creating the project would allow the students to retain the information better, there is no guarantee that the information itself would be accurate. Any student can make a worksheet or an assignment based on what they have learned, but few can do it correctly. If student-designed projects are done incorrectly, then the purpose of the project is completely disregarded; the entire point of the summer projects is to make sure students do not forget valuable information. Having teacher-designed projects is a safer and more reliable option. Teachers have studied the subject for years and have experience, meanwhile students are only just beginning to understand the concepts of the subject. Teachers must be able to determine whether or not what they are doing with their students is not superficial, but actually necessary and needed for the students. The projects designed by teachers provide a safety net for their students, while the projects designed by students would be a gamble.

Though it is important that students are able to successfully work on their own, their ability to collaborate with peers and help one another is extremely beneficial for them. Making students design their own project is not only extremely stressful, it also isolates them from other students and from help. Teacher-designed projects would be uniform, meaning every students receives the same project. It would allow them to look to classmates for help if needed, or to even work together as a unit to get the project done. The collaboration would lessen the burden on the students and would also let them enjoy their summer break. Creating their own projects would quickly become overwhelming for students, especially if they have no one to turn to for support. Instead of focusing on the information like they are supposed to, the panicked students would focus only on finishing their assignment before it is due, thus defeating the purpose of the project.

The main goal of summer projects is to provide students with a way to retain everything they have learned and to be prepared for their next school year, regardless of who creates the projects. To best achieve this goal, teachers should be the ones who design the projects. Teacher-designed projects would provide everything that students will need, as well as allow them breathing room during their well deserved break from school. Overall, teachers designing the projects would be a win-win for everyone involved. The students would feel confident and prepared, while the teachers would not have to worry about going over concepts from the year prior. At the end of the day, as long as the students feel comfortable and prideful of their work that was created by a teacher, then that is all that matters.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
698BD19AABD9,"Summer projects have been around for decades and have the stigma of being boring or just too much work for one student to handle due to not understanding the information because the project is about a class they have yet to take as schools require students to learn over break. These thoughts provoke the idea of student designed projects instead of teacher-designed projects due to the student knowing what they are capable of and are well equipped for. Schools should allow students to be able to design their own projects in the thought of students knowing what they are capable of, what intrigues the student about the class they are taking, and is equal for all learners and with these points, it allows the student to feel more confident in their required summer projects.

Required. It's the word that comes to mind as students try to complete their summer projects with the idea of only striving to get an A+ on it. There are no other thoughts as students scramble to get it done, but with the idea of students being able to design it, it changes the way that the students look at it. With the ability to design, the students are able to choose what intrigues them about the class they are doing the project for and with that in mind, it gives them more of a push to try and complete the summer project. The idea of choosing what you want to focus on gives nostalgia to the idea of Science Fairs when they were children. The Science Fair was a science project that was required as a grade and students had to complete it, but they allowed for students to design the idea of the project and to learn and explore about what intrigues them and it gave them this look at what science with the mix of combining what you love. The teachers would allow kids to design and create what they wanted while following a prompt and an agenda of what they needed to complete. This ties into doing student-designed projects with the example of doing what you love, but with the agenda and being able to cover certain points that the teachers wanted them to learn in their summer projects.

What about the teachers? That's a question that you would ask. The pros of teachers creating the summer projects is for the unity that it gives the projects making it easier for the teachers to grade, but turning back onto the point of the Science Fair if they created an agenda for the students to follow, then they would be able to grade it efficently. The major issue that could come up is the fact that most teachers use the summer projects as a way to teach the first lesson of year by the ability of already having background information on it and being able to give quizzes on it to test the students knowledge. This is a great point that would come up in these debates, but a simple way of solving this issue is to make the project based on the information of the class by allowing the students to choose something that would be taught in the class either later or in the beginning of the year and to solve the issue with taking a quiz based on the assignments, the student could describe the topic they did their project about and allow it so that it was vague allowing for students to write about whatever their topic was which makes it so that everyone could do the quiz and it wouldn't have to be based on a teacher-designed project.

This allows for teachers to be able to test on this knowledge and still allows the student to learn whatever they want to learn with their project.

Teachers don't create projects that are equal to all learners. When students are able to design their own work, it allows for them to create it in a way that they learn best. Everyone learns differently and teachers don't create projects that effectively help everyone learn and instead it's based of one sole learner or based on how they learn as a person. The way you learn impacts everything you do in a school because projects are based off of the idea that you learn a certain way and with that in mind, if students design their own project they are able to create it in the best way, so that they can retain the information. This allows them to continue learning and to be able to do it in the way that suits them the best and by doing so, it causes them to be more intrigued in doing their work if they are able to understand it more. We have put in place test that allow for audio to be played, so that people who don't speak fluent English can listen to how it would be in Spanish which allows them to more fully understand. Teachers create slides with pictures and text in the hopes that visual and regular learners can both equally understand. Teachers create YouTube videos in hopes that by saying it out people who learn better in listening can listen to the lectures repeatedly instead of having to flip through slides. We have put these conditions in, so that others can learn to the best of their ability with the tools that have been provided. It provokes the idea that projects should be equal in this way, so that when a student does a project they can learn in the best way they can which assures that they are learning during their break. Student-designed project would all for the playing field to be level, so that all learners are able to do their projects more efficently and to be able to be confident in what they have completed.

Finally, student-designed projects allow for students to feel confident in what they are putting out into the world and with the idea that they will be intrigued and given an agenda that the teachers can have faith in. Throughout this essay, we have learned that with these projects, it allows for the projects to be more intriguing for students, it allows teachers to be more flexible and still have the ability to test on this knowledge, it creates the projects to be equal for all learners and lastly, it allows students to be confident in what they have achieved while inspiring others to do the same. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
263E94CD1C90,"During the summer would you students want to do the same old slide presentation about a topic you don't care about? Would you rather have your teacher choose the assignment and the way you do the assignment or would you rather choose the assignment yourself and the way you get to do the assignment? I think summer projects should be student-designed instead of them being teacher-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed because, the students could choose something they are interested in, the students will actually finish the project on time and the projects would have a more creative thought.

The first reason why I think summer projects should be student-designed is that the students can actually pick a topic they are interested in. Teenagers are not going to care about anything if they are not interested in it. If we got to choose what our project can be about and how we want to do it, I promise more students will actually do the project. Also it is the time of the year where there is no school and everyone is out doing something. People could be out on vacation, playing different sports, working and all different kinds of things. Everyone should have a good topic that is interesting to them. The teachers usually gives us a boring topic we would have to look up on the internet or a database and then we would have to research about it. The teachers make us do that basically the whole year so at least in the summer let us choose what the project should be about.

My next reason as to why I think us students should be able to have control over summer projects is that most students will actually do it and get it done on time. This reason kind of connects with the first reason but more people would turn it in on time because, we get to choose how the project is set up. Also the final product will come out better because they actually care about the topic. Since the project is based on how we want it, more students will put more effort into the project and getting it done on time. They might even add more than you expected and exceed your expectations. Summer projects will be ten times easier and more fun to do

My last reason as to why I think that we should be allowed to control our own summer projects is that there would be more creativity among the students. Most of the projects we get in school is an essay or a PowerPoint slide. Very boring and basic ways to do assignments, but imagine if students got to control the way they do their project. People would be doing edited videos, speeches and maybe even bring in a tri fold, and that is not even half of the ways students can do their projects. Some students can be so creative when it comes to school assignments, but all the teachers wants us to do some boring essay or slide show. When students get to be more creative I think they tend to do better on projects. Also like I said before, it will be a summer project, which means it will be in the summer and students will have plenty of time to get the tools and everything they need to do the project. There are various ways a student can do a project.

Also some teachers might think why would they let their students do a project about topics that has nothing to do with the class their taking. Some people might think a teacher-designed summer project, the traditional way, is better to have than a student-designed summer project. I understand where those people might be coming from, but at the same time, I wouldn't just throw them course based assignments already when the class hasn't even started yet. The teachers have not even taught them anything or even seen them, but they want to give them a summer assignment about something no one has taught us yet. Getting to know how your students are and what they are capable of is more important, in my opinion. A project about how a student's summer went can tell a lot about the student and If I was a teacher I would want to know how my students are and how they do assignments so I would plan around that so I could make the school year be a whole lot smoother. I wouldn't just throw students an assignment about something they haven't learned about yet.

In conclusion, I think that student-designed summer projects are better than teacher-designed summer projects because students will actually get it done on time, there would be more creativity among the students and the students would have the liberty to choose any type of topic they want to choose. Yes teacher-designed summer projects might have some good points, but overall it is better to have student-designed summer projects. It wouldn't be no more boring PowerPoint slides all the time, it would be more fun, creative and interesting projects for when the school year begins.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
E82267D7C2FB,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during these long summer breaks. Students should have the ability to pick their own projects, because they can do a project over something that interests them and they would like to know more about. This could also want them to share an idea with there class that they find interesting this could be a good way to educate themselves and the other students.

If students are aloud to pick the project that they would like to do,they could learn about something that they never knew before, this could make them want to find out more about it and research more and have more details for the project. If students are aloud to pick it they could educate themselves and make their mind run wild,it could also challenge the mind to keep on finding more details and more information so that they could have a good project. They wouldn't only educate themselves but it would teach the other classmates something new and make them pay more attention to the project and more kids will be awake for it and not want to fall asleep because its an interesting project. Kids have a big mind and if we let them do what they want for education they could amaze the teachers and make them want to give the kids more of these self reliable projects. Students would also have the ability to decorate there project and make it more appealing and more beautiful to look at and that would grab other kids attention.

Some students don't always do the project that the teacher assign to them and most of the kids will not do it and fail, and that could make the kids not move onto the next grade. If teachers let students pick their own project over the summer most of the kids would do it, because they have a choice and the grades will rise and kids will move onto the next grade. They wouldn't only move onto the next grade they would also have a good bond with their parents, because the kids are stress free and have good grades. Some family's go on family vacation during the summer and some kids don't have time to finish the project, but if they had a choice they wouldn't have to rush, because they could always write over something they like and then they could also have some fun and enjoy there summer, and they don't have to rush and get the project done. Everyone has been there once when you got a project and its so hard that you can't think of something and your are sitting in front of your computer thinking about something to research on, this could cause you to have stress and make you angry, writing over something you like and find interesting could help you reduce stress and make you a happier pearson and the less stress you have the friendlier you will be.

If the project was off of what the teacher would want us to write about it would be hard and it would challenge our mind to think beyond the boundaries and make us smarter and more intelligent. Teachers only want the best for their students so they pick the hard projects to make our minds grow so that we can be smarter and be ready for college. The projects that the teachers pick can be challenging but you can learn something interesting or maybe something new that you never even knew existed. Teachers are good people and they just want us to be successful in life.

If teachers let students pick their own projects more kids will do it and there would be a good passing rate in the class, because students are not forced to do something that they hate they can let their minds run free and find something interesting to do their project on. There will be more information for the classmates to learn and the teacher may learn something that they haven't learned before. Students can reduce stress and enjoy the project that they are doing. Students have a wild and creative mind if teachers let them us it for education it will amaze them with all the knowledge that they have. let the students have a choice and let their minds run free like a bird.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
DDEF5E8CEDA0,"Ever had a school project that you had to do over the summer? Ever hated a teacher for making you do it? And I know you think that summer time is to be not focused on school and to have a break but, school is important and so is focusing on it too. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning their break. I believe these summer projects should be teacher designed. They should be teacher designed to get a head start for next year, over the summer our brains just get caught up in the fun and time off, and it would be more challenging to us if a teacher designed it.

First, it is important to head start for the next year. It would feel amazing to be in the top of your class and finally understand everything your teacher was talking about. In doing so, you could even start to tutor your friends and classmates. I don't know about you but, when ever I get a ""light bulb"" in class or finally I feel like I know what I'm doing is correct, I feel amazing. Imagine having that feeling in that class most of the time! If you had a summer project that a teacher designed, you could get a head start with the materials and may even learn them better in the process.

Secondly, remember during the school year when you would dream about being on a beach or even just being at home having some rest from school? Don't you want summer to last forever? Everyone misses summer at some point, especially when it's blowing snow outside. Also, remember when august comes around and you start to dread about going to school? Yeah me too but, when you have summer projects you can exercise your brain and make it not so hard when you come back to school. I believe if summer projects were student based, nothing would get done. If anything, the bare minimum would get done because kids want to spend time resting and relaxing and not having to worry about anything.

Lastly, it would be more challenging for the students. If you were to make a project over summer, it would be a mess. It would be past due, not done at all, or just not done with enough effort. Most teachers give you this project not to be mean, but to benefit you in the long run. I feel like if a student made a project for themselves, it would not be challenging enough and also, you want a good impression on that teacher that you are hard working and can go through any challenges that may come your way.

Next time you get a project to do over the summer, be thankful and look at the positives from it. Mostly the teacher isn't trying to be mean and try to ""ruin your summer"" so, don't think of it in that way. You can be a tutor and get some side money while you are at it, you can make a good impression on your teacher, and many more. So, next time you get a project over the summer that the teacher designed just know they are coming from the right place. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
F03B8BB4539F,"It is important for students to continue developing their minds and knowledge over summer break, but I think it is even more important for them to do so by doing something that intrigues them. During the school year, students are constantly pressured to do assignments that aren't of their interest, which commonly leads them to procrastinate the assignments and their desire to do any work drops. Summer break is an escape for students nationwide; teachers should allow them to have that time to be stress-free, to have fun, and to enjoy everyday to the best of their ability. I believe that if students were to have to do a summer project it should be student-designed for these three reasons: (1) there is no reason for a student to learn about something that doesn't interest them over their break, (2) a student should not be stressed or confused about school work over break, and (3) the student's mind would develop more by giving them the freedom to use imagination and creativity to design their own project.

During the school year, students are made to do assignments that they may not understand or have any interest in. And while teachers assign that work in order to give the students the information they need for standardized testing, there is no reason for them to give the students work that fits that curriculum over summer break. As a student in high school, it is quite common to hear students, and even teachers, say that the topics we have to learn about will be useless in our everyday lives as adults. As I implied before, summer is supposed to be an escape from the constant memorization of information for the next big test. A student-designed project over the summer would continue the education of the students, but in a way that allows them to learn about and work on a topic that they find interest in.

Although there are other things that could stress out a student over summer break, one of those stresses should never be schoolwork. Many don't realize it, but the amount of stress that high school and college students tend to carry around is extreme. For example, I am constantly over thinking about the countless hours of homework that I will have to sit through when I get home, the big test that I will probably fail at the end of the week, or exactly how these people expect me to get an A in a class when the teacher doesn't even teach me. Situations like this leave students to worry; in my opinion, students shouldn't have to go through that during their time off. By giving them the opportunity to create their own project and decide what they will be spending their time working on, the chances of the students becoming stressed over the assignment would be lower than if the teacher were to design the project and give them certain criteria to fill.

When a teacher assigns a project that the students aren't particularly interested in, odds are that they will just breeze through the whole thing and not retain any of the information because they just want to complete the assignment. Thus meaning that the project didn't actually help the student develop in any way. I am almost certain that this would be especially true over the summer months when students have no desire to do school work, mostly because they aren't in school and, in the case of a teacher-designed project, wouldn't find the assignment interesting. If teachers were to give the students the freedom to design their own projects, the students would have to be creative in making an assignment in order to keep themselves entertained. The likelihood of a student making a project on something that doesn't interest them is very much unlikely. I truly don't think anyone would willingly do work that didn't interest them.

Overall, I believe that a summer project designed by a teacher would be miserable and useless. Because of the standardized testing situation, students being forced to learn material that isn't particularly important. Students feel that their success is determined by the score they get, and honestly, it kind of is. As you can imagine, that can cause someone a lot of stress and actually end up limiting their ability to develop into something/someone greater. I am sure that everyone knows what it feels like to lose a little bit of confidence and determination once you get a bad grade on an assignment. After weeks and months of students learning the curriculum that the state wants them to learn, I think it important to give them the time and encouragement to look into a topic that may actually be of interest to them. Which is where the student-designed project comes into play. All students deserve to have a break from the mental battle that comes along with constantly forcing themselves to learn information that doesn't intrigue them. A summer project should be open ended so that the students don't fall under the pressure of meeting the specific standards of the teacher, but to feel obligated to look into something they find interesting. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
CEF8476956C8,"Once summer break begians, most students feel realived that they do not have to worry about school work till the next school year. However, most teachers make their students complete a summer project to make sure they continue to learn throughout their summer vacation. If there were no summer porjects, sudents would come into the new school almost feeling brain dead from the lack of learning. The summer projects should be teacher designed because they can ensure you the purpose of the project will benefit the students education and if the sudents were to desinged it they would make the projects too easy to avoid challenging themselves.

If the teachers were to design the summer project they will be able to create a project that will cover inforamtion that the studens have learned in the previous year or introduce the inforamtion they will learn the next school year. For example, if an english teacher was to assigne a book project, the studenst would be required to complete reading the book and the project that the teacher designed. The teacher would then be able to teach more indepth and create benefical activites that all the students would be able to relate too after summer break. If the teacher was to make the projects a group project, it gives the students the chance to work thier clabotaion skills with thier classmates during summer break. This will give the studnest a way to always be learning and a way to start off the school year on the right foot.

When it comes to students designing their own summer projects, no student would willing challenge themselves if they had the option to make all their school work easy. From personal experiance, most of my peers always try to get by in school by doing the bare minimum in all their classes. I can understand why when we all have at least seven classes to complete school work for. However, during the summer most students will have pelenty of time to foucus on one summer project and make sure it is done with their best effort. The sudents are given a decent amount of time to acually absorb the information they are learning instead of rushing through every assigment like they would during the school year. If the teachers were to design the projects, they can ensure the student will be challlanged, but they know the students are given more theen enough time to complete the project.

Studets who are asssigned a summer project may be unmotivaed to complete it becuase of their lack of intrest in the topic. If the teachers were to design the summer project the studnets would be limited to what they are allowed to learn though the project, which would make many studnets unexcited to learn. If they students were to design the projects, they would be able to pick a topic that they are acually interested in learning about and would create a sense of modivation. When students find a topic they want to learn about, it makes learning so much more enjoyable, which would make more stuents want to comeple their summer projects. However, there is always the risk of students making their project too simple when they are the ones desging the projets, which would defeats the purpose of the summer projects.

Overall, the students and teachers would benefit the most if the teachers were to design the summer projects. As much as studenst dislike school and the amout of homework they are faced with everynight, these summer projects create a way to make leaning more enjoyable and exciting. The teachers are able to challenge their students in a stress free enviernment. When the students are not under a lot of stress duing their summer, they are able to ratine the inforamtion they are learing insted of putting all their hard work to waste. Summer projects are a great way to ensure the students are stilling learning throughout the summer, but are able to do it at their own pace and helpes make sure each student is prepared for the next school year.  ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
FD2DD23CB152,"Some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure they continue learning over their break. Although some may disagree, teachers should design the project. Those who disagree state that students would be more involved if they designed it themselves or chose their own prompt, but these are simply not true. The best way a summer project should be carried out is with a teacher's design, and here's why.

First off, teachers are the ones who shall grade it, so they should be the ones who choose the guidelines for that grade. This gives teachers the ability to give all the students the same thing but pick out which projects were done good. If every student designed their own project then there would be no control for what is good and what is bad. On top of that, when students all have a teacher designed project it makes it so they have to reach a certain level of effort, and not just be lazy and write two sentences. Allowing students to design their own project would most definitely enable some more lazy projects.

In addition, some students prefer to have something structured and guided so they dont have to create everything from scratch. Projects can be hard to completely design without any loopholes or flaws. Some students simply lack the creativity to think up a whole project on their own. Projects could be anything, from a potato being observed to a summer book review. Giving students that much freedom would only cause confusion among them and the teacher trying to grade many very different projects. The projects would be incomparable, so how would a teacher be able to argue that one is bad and another isn't. What if students want to help each other on their projects? well they cant if every project is unique; however, if given a prompt they can cooperate and benefit from each other in creating a unique, yet immaculate project.

Although some may disagree, students should not be allowed to design their own summer projects, they would be less efficient and become easily not gradable. Those who disagree with this statement say that students feel more relaxed doing their own project, and are more enthusiastic if they have full creative control. However, these statements are simply not true. In the end, there is many reasons why teachers should control summer projects, and whether students like it or not, it is better for all if the teacher designs them. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
898F6EB240EA,"Summer break has finally arrived and students can not wait to relax and have fun. But some schools assign projects for students even while they have summer break. They do this so the students can continue to learn even when they are on break. Those assignments and projects need to have the accurate amount of designing and planning either by the students or the teachers. Students should have the right and responsibility to design their own projects for the summer. Students will have the ability to show their creativity. Students will make their assignments fun and educational and last but not least, students will not have as much stress if they can design their own projects.

When students or young people in general have the opportunity to create or design something, their creativity flourishes. They can come up with many ideas and suggestions when they write papers, draw pictures or sing and dance. Making and creating their own assignments would not be any different. Students will enjoy being able to be in control of their own assignments. It would give them a sense of responsibility and also the feeling of being able to do something on their own. Teachers would see how accountable and imaginative their students truly are.

Some may say, that students could potentially make their assignments too easy and will not put in enough work. They could take advantage of how much creativity they can show by hindering how much creativity they actually put into the project. If they did that, they would not show their true artistic potential in the assignment. If the students wants to be truly seen as a responsible, young adults, then they should not take advantage of the project and they should put the correct amount of effort into the assignment. The next reason as to why students should assign their own projects over the summer is that could make it fun but also educational at the same time.

Some teachers' assignments can be more educational than they are fun. Teachers want what is best for their students. When it comes to projects that are to be done over the summer though, their should be a balance of education and fun since students are on break from school itself. Students will have the opportunity to incorporate the fun as well as the educational side of the project. Pupils will be excited and intrigued with how they can learn from their very own project, while having fun at the same time. The fun of the project at times could overpower the educational gain from the assignment. The student could be caught up in so much of the fun, that they do not realize the learning aspect of the project. However, students should want the teacher to see how they benefited from the project that they designed on their own. The last reason why students should design their own projects over the summer is that they are not put through much stress.

Many assignments, especially if someone is in an honors or AP class, can be daunting. Students controlling their own projects will make them at ease. Young people know their limits and they also know when they are not able to do certain things. When they create their own assignments, they will cater to their own limits. They will not feel the same pressure that would come from a regular assignment from school. Summer breaks are supposed to be relaxing. Students should not feel stress especially from school during their vacation. Many students around the world all know how stress inducing some assignments can be. They would feel so much better if they could create it on their own.

Some may say that students will hold back and not try things that may take more work, like was mentioned in the second paragraph. But summer vacations are supposed to refresh students. Students will not be under a lot of pressure, but they will still be able to learn when they design their own projects for the summer.

Over the summer projects are assigned in many schools. Teachers have the responsibility of creating their own projects for their pupils. Students though should be able to create and design it for themselves. When they create the project by themselves they show their creative ability. They can make it fun and educational at the same. Lastly, they will not be under much pressure or stress. So if someone's school encourages the idea of over-the-summer projects, the students should also encourage the idea of letting the students create their own projects. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
E03ABEC27E0E,"When I came to United States I had to learn English to become a psychologist. I went to school to learn and adapt to new place. I thought that no one couldn't help me. Until, school gave a solution that help me and motivate to achieve my goals. I'm proud of learning by summer projects made as student-designed. Therefore, summer projects should be student-designed because help students to build knowledge, experience, and relationships.

First, the summer projects should be student-designed because it will help increase students' knowledge. Also, creates an environment to help students build strategies that improve their achievements. Complete projects during summer will prepare them to learn quickly a subject. For example,

Generic_Name and Generic_Name improved a lot during vacations. They enjoyed learning through the methods both adapt. An example, both felt insecure with the teachers methods to teach. So, both adapted a method step by step to learn the subject. Generic_Name learned to listen and communicate her ideas through the projects as a student-designed. Meanwhile, Generic_Name developed patience and strategies to solve his problems in math. Generic_Name and Generic_Name improved in science and math. Although, Generic_Name and Generic_Name believed that summer projects weren't helping enough. Their knowledge increased a lot by the summer projects that both complete. In addition, project made as student-designed improve and build greater coefficient intellectual.

Next, complete summer projects by student-designed will create a bond with the students's experiences. For instance, the experiences that I helped me learn English. I developed a purpose to learn a new language through the situations that I live. I came to United States without any knowledge of English. I felt lonely and mad because I made many mistakes in my classes. My English skills didn't help me enough to comprehend any of my subjects. Then, the experiences that I lived in schools became a motivation. I feel secure about myself and the skills that I builded through summer projects made to student-designed. Another reason, each summer project made as student-designed are based in their experiences. Some students may need methods to concentrate as their classmates.

Finally, students-designed to learn subjects and build relationships through activities. The summer projects that are student-designed will improve strategies and build relationship between classmates and teachers. For example, my sister Generic_Name preferred to work alone than as a group with her classmates. Despite, her grades decreased and make her feel pessimistic her teacher gave her a solution. The solution was to learn as group with her classmates. Generic_Name accepted her teacher's solution to increase her grades. The summer projects that were student-designed help her build relationships with her classmates and increase her grades. Furthermore, I'm sure that summer project that made as student-designed help many people to build relationships with anyone in the same situation.

In conclusion, summer projects should be students-designed because of the huge opportunities to help us as students to improve our motivation to learn. The chances to learn during vacation will make us feel prepare to comeback to school.

A way to help students to learn and believe in their capacity to become the future of the country. People that believe in the students to achieve their goals. Despite, the numerous mistake we made to achieve our goals are the motivation become an excellent student. So, I motivate you to believe that summer projects should be student-designed.           ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
DCEFAC68750A,"Schools all across the nation are requiring students to complete projects over summer break. Research shows that these assignments are extremely helpful to a students learning power. Although there are benefits for completing these summer projects, students and teachers are conflicted with one major underlying issue. Should teachers design the assignments, or students?

From personal experience, teachers should definitely design summer projects for students. When I was in the seventh grade, my science teacher gave us a project to complete over the summer, but there was no strict topic on the assignment. Our teacher told us, ""complete this project over summer break and be sure to come up with a creative design for your assignment."" Given these vague directions, students created poorly structured projects that included little, to the very least of science material within their work. Why were their projects created so poorly? It is simple, over summer break the last thing on a students mind is school work, but when assigned a project that allows the student to design it however they desire, their work will inevitably lead to a disaster.

A recent study showed that students who were assigned a project that was designed by a teacher increased the likelihood of having higher grades when the next school year started. The logical reasoning behind this conclusion is because teachers know what topics the students should focus on over break. Teacher designed projects challenge a students intelligence by enabling them to put in time and effort into their work rather than putting in little to no dedication at all. For example, if an individual was given a teacher designed project about pollution and how it affects our world, the student would be required to put in as much effort possible into the specific topic that is assigned, rather than creating a sorry topic of their own.

Given this information, hopefully schools all across the nation will continue to assign teacher designed projects over the summer. By doing so, it is certain students will learn more, be more attentive on a specific topic, and enable them to do their absolute best on any future assignment. Please take the time to share this issue with as many individuals as you can to fight against this growing problem. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
1D5D22EBADBB,"I highly think students should design, and the reason why im chosing students is because, studente need the oppertunity to express what they feel plus, student are way more creative in my opinion. Some teacher think that the students shouldnt make their own prompts because i guess the teachers want the prompts to have reasons to them.

First of all, these promps do sometimes get on my nerves in my opinion because were spending our time trying to figure out how ot set up the thesis and what examples can will fit with the paragraph and how does it support the idea. When the teachers make these prompts they expect us to get it right off the back and not struggle but some of them we have to sit back and think about how can this be an impact of how does this support the idea. Us students can be very exellent writers if we try and take our time, thats why if we get to write our own prompts about creative things and events that weve experienced.

Secondly, The reason why that i say that the teachers shouldnt write the paragraphs is because half of them are about school activites, there'ye never about fun things we dont on the weekends or how our breaks were there'ye always about adding extra hours in school, dress codes and adding extra class or something like that its nevr on things the students want to write about it always has to be school related nevr something fun.

Lastly, Some students may say that the teachers write better prompts but when you write sbout something you actullay enjoy or love then you actullay might consider because writing is another way of expressing how you feel and it gives you diffrent ways to say it. Writing is and important thing in life because when we go off to college it going to get harder because were in the stage of becoming and adult grow up and college is no ijoke its way harder its preparing you for the outside world (life) so enjoy writing while you can beause it doent get any easier than this

In conclusion, i feel as if the students would write better prompts then the teacahers in my opipion. We the students have more creativity then the teachers no offense but im just speaking the truth, us students can make writing prompts and other activities way more fun then it already is. What im trying to say is give us students a chance to write some prompts and make writing more fun and educantional.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4

Which is why summer projects should be teacher-designed project. Teachers know what you need to know to be prepared for the next school year and its a easy grade for the new year and it can be turned into your own with your creative, fun ideas.

Teachers know better than students in many things. They know the curriculum for the next school year. Which is why they can make the project based off stuff you need to know ,so you won't fall behind. It's easy to forget things and having this project will allow you to stay on the same track as your peers. It's important that you have knowledge going into the next grade and a little studying time over the summer.

Doing this during the summer can start your school year off with better grades and intentions. A summer project will remind you what you learned and keep you up to date. So, when your back to school your grades are up and you gained more knowledge.

Its a sneak peep into what the year will bring you.

Even if you don't enjoy projects and school doesn't interest you this project can be turned into your own. You can make the project interesting and still get it done. You can go outside the box and make this fun and easy to do. While still getting the knowledge you need. Even if it's teacher-designed you can figure out ways to make your project different and enjoyable to do and read.

2BB881487FD0,"Summer is a time away from the stresses of school, the chaos of getting assignments in before the deadline, and a chance to catch up on the little to no sleep we've gotten. But remember that feeling of sitting in a desk after two or three months, not remembering the proper way to hold a pencil or how to speak a language you spoke in all of last year? Although it is a pain to be thinking about school and grades over the summer, doing some summer projects to keep our minds in check is not the worst idea in the world. However, the question of whether a summer project should be teacher-designed verses student-designed, I believe, has an enormous impact on the effectiveness and quality of the project itself. Based on personal experiences, summer projects should be student-designed to improve the quality, effectiveness, and to allow the project to be more enjoyable overall.

The idea is simple, it is a known fact that when a student likes what they are reading or learning, they are more motivated to do it. For my fourth grade summer project, my teacher assigned us all the same book and told to complete a plot analysis through either a paper or a plot diagram. I read this book the weekend before school started and wrote my plot analysis the night before. Looking back at it, I understand why fourth grade me put it off to the last second. Even eleventh grade me would put a project like that off to the last second. I wasn't given a choice. I had no freedom. Not even a little wiggle room to be creative. The quality of that project was very poorly done. I had no motivation to put even half of my effort into it because my number one goal was to get the project over with and finish it before the deadline.

However, my sixth grade summer project was very different. Our teacher allowed us to pick a book from a list and gave us some guidelines on a project we had to complete, but left the ends very loose so that we could choose what we did and how it was done. I chose to create a book trailer which soon became one of my favorite projects. I was so excited that I would work on it a little bit every day because I cared so much about the outcome. When I sent my project to my teacher, he sent me an email about how he was impressed with the amount of work and dedication I had put into a simple summer project.

To state the obvious, the quality, my attitude, and time management of my sixth grade summer project was very night and day when compared to my fourth grade project. It is more motivational to complete a project over the summer when it is something you enjoy. Whether that happens to be an essay or a book trailer, I strongly believe that students should be given the opportunity and freedom to make a project their own. For this can also help their new teacher get to know their students better for the new school year. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
90212225F733,"Research indicates that students forget almost one-third of what they learned during the school year over summer. Without consistent reinforcement of learned material over the summer, students lose essential knowledge about concepts that are going to be built upon in the next school year. In response to that, schools have started to require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break to prevent minimal loss of information. These projects will allow students to retain knowledge and learn over the break so they are prepared for the next school year. The summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers are knowledgable about the information students need to learn, student-designed projects may lead them to do the project incorrectly, and students may not make their summer projects challenging enough to learn new concepts.

Teachers are educated in their field of study and pass that knowledge to their students; they are aware of the information and requirements for students to know for the next school year. By having teachers design the summer projects, they can readdress concepts that students need practice with or struggled with last school year so they will not be troubled by it in the future. For example, in the book

Counting By 7s , the main character excells at history. Although she excells in that subject, she has trouble with other subjects. A teacher-designed summer project for her may be focused on math and writing while her student-designed project would have been based on history, which may help her retain that knowledge, but does not help her with subjects she truly needs practice with. In addition, teacher-designed summer projects can have students learn new material that will be used in the upcoming school year. Teachers are aware of what will be taught in a course next whereas students are not. These summer projects would allow students to prepare ahead of time for the school year by reaffirming previous knowledge and learning new information directed towards the course. Many educational resources are only for teacher use or are not accessible to students prior to the school year, such as syallbuses and requirements for a course, Khan Academy, and other study sites, allowing teachers to be more effective in designing summer projects than students. Having the summer to complete teacher-designed summer projects will allow students to expand their knowledge on topics they need to learn or struggled with so they are prepared for the coming school year.

If students were to design summer projects, they may be unintentionally flawed or incorrect because the students are not experts on the subject like teachers. Student-designed summer projects may allow students to express their creativity, but can ultimately lead them to learn the information incorrectly. Teachers are guides and resources for students to follow when learning information and asking questions. Frederick Douglass, a slave in the 1800s, became self-educated by looking at other students' papers and reading magazines and books. Although he helped himself become more knowledgable about the world through the new information he obtained, he learned some information wrong because he was not guided or corrected by teachers. Student-designed projects can be precarious because teachers cannot correct students if the project is designed inccorectly. If the project were teacher-designed, then the correct information will be present and learned by the students. The summer projects being flawed can also hurt students. By learning the information incorrectly, they are likely to repeat the same mistakes, making it harder to correct them. In the book

Fish in a Tree , a girl with dyslexia struggled with writing because the words kept moving. She got into the habit of writing letters a specific way so that when a teacher noticed and corrected her, it was hard for her to stop the habit of writing letters incorrectly. Student-designed projects can give students the freedom to express their creativity through learning and designing, but this also allows for students to do their project incorrectly because they learned the material wrong, leading them to repeat the same mistakes because the teacher is not aware of how the students are designing their projects.

Summer is the period of relaxation and taking a break from school for students. Giving the freedom of designing summer projects to students allows them to make the project easy to complete, preventing them from challenging themselves and learning new information through exploration of the project. Students can manipulate student-designed summer projects by creating a project that is not difficult to do, therefore not pushing or challenging them to learn new information. One example of this was demonstrated by a study of a homeschooled family in the Midwest. The parents gave their children the freedom of designing their own cirriculum for education based on their interests. Instead of centering their cirriculum and challenging themselves with subjects like algebra or chemistry, they studied games and did not necessarily learn anything. By having teacher-designed projects, teachers can challenge the students so they learn the new information about subjects for the coming year, which fulfills the requirements of learning over the break. Teacher-designed projects would challenge students to learn while student-designed projects can be made easy for the student to complete.

Teacher-designed summer projects can prepare students for the coming year by addressing upcoming subbjects and topics students have previously struggled with. In addition, it prevents students from learning information wrong or doing the project incorrectly by giving them specific guidelines. These projects also ensures that students are challenged and learn new information. Teacher-designed summer projects would be more beneficial for students.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
CCD66CF93741,"Every Year, students of all ages reach summer break. Many of these students get excited to take time off of school and spend time with friends and family. However, as students get older, some schools require them to do summer projects to keep their mind active and engaged between the years. Teachers should choose these summer projects due to their understanding in education and experience they hold in life.

One reason why teachers should choose what the students should do over the summer is because they already know the subject. Most teachers have taught the class for a long time and know the objectives that will make the project useful. Even though students may know some information about the class, they still lack the skill of fully understanding the subject of a class they have never taken before. In fact, most teachers have gotten a degree in education. Teachers are required to go to college for years before they teach the subject. With the practice and skill they have required over the years, they are able to create worksheets and projects that help students learn.

Students are much younger than teachers and lack making smart choices when it comes to learning. Teachers have been around for a much longer time. They graduated school and have made the mistakes and learned to know what is the right solution on the amount of work a student should do over the summer. While students may be creative, they do not have a fully developed brain. Teachers understand the students are young and do not know how to design something so important by themselves. If teachers design projects, they will make sure that it will not be a waste of their time.

Some students will get very stressed about doing a project on a topic that they have no knowledge on. Many students have health issues that disable them from creating their own projects. Over the years, anxiety has increased into students' lives, especially teens. Many teachers have once been in the place of a stressful teen and know what its like to be in their place. Some may argue that students will have an easier time if they create the project themselves, but it will only create more stress for the student in the long run. If the school allows teachers to create the projects for the students, they will be able to ensure that the project will be stress free, fun and useful.

In conclusion, teachers should be the ones to create a summer project due to their fulfillment in education and experience. Teachers have been around for a lot longer and know what the students need and dont need in their curriculum. Their experience in life make it easier to understand what its like to be a student wanting a relaxing summer break. Teachers will know not to go too far on their students like some may do to themselves. While students may want to take the matter in their own hands, teachers are the ones that have the ability to make it stress free and useful for the future. Therefore, teachers are better equipped for the role of creating a summer project.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
F0B85AFBC243,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure they continue learning. Students summer projects should be teacher-designed because it will be easier to grade and students are more likely to do it.

If students summer projects were teacher-designed then it will make grading easier. They wont have to change up their grading system because everyone will be doing the same one. The teacher will base all the projects off of the one that got an 100%. Also they will grade them faster. If students designed their own projects, the teacher would have to grade each one differently. Instead of the doing the same project and grading them the same. Teachers also have other things that they need to grade, so when all the students do the same project it makes it easy for them.

If students were allowed to design their own projects, they would be less likely to do them. One reason is that students would forget about them because it summer time and they have better things to do. Another reason is because some of them would wait last minute to do them and wouldnt have any time to do or finish them. When a teacher assigns work and gives you a due date for them, students will make sure they get it done. Its different when a teacher gives you a project and when you get to pick your projects. Students have a mindset where its more important when if a teacher tells you to do it, so that means they have to get it done. If students pick then it wouldnt be important because its what they want to do.

A reason why students shouldnt pick their own projects is because no students wants to do work over the summer. Giving students the option to pick their projects, theyre going to pick to forget it. Summer is the time that students dot have to worry about school work, grades, teacher, basically anything thats related to school. Some students dont even do projects the time that theyre in school, so theyre definitely not going to do it outside of school. Especially when they can be using that time to have fun and do what they want.

If teachers want students to do a summer project then they shouldnt pick it because students are not gonna do it. They would be more likely to do it just because teacher are picking, so they can continue learning during the summer.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
CD10A87243D1,"Summer break serves primarily as a time for relaxation and rest from the busy school schedule for both students and teachers. It is, however, important that students continue to learn over their vacation and enter the school year prapared and ready to succeed in their classes. In most cases, teachers will assign summer assignments like summer readings or research papers that provide students with a baseline preparedness in skills necessary for the class. Some believe these summer assignments should be created by students, believing that it will help them exercise their creativity as well as develop their own learning style. While a student-designed experience has its benefits, it is still more advantageous for teachers to create these summer assignments as it ensures all students enter the year with the same level of preparedness, allows teachers to better plan the year's curriculum and pace, and helps train certain skills necessary to succeed in the class.

Student-designed summer projects claim to be beneficial as they allow students freedom in choosing the topics students study and the type of work they prefer to do, allowing them to be more invested in their work as well as boosting productivity and creativity. This feature, however, proves to be more harmful to a student than helpful as it reults in students starting the year with vastly different levels of understanding. When students enter the year at different levels of understanding, the teacher has to spend a considerable amount of time at the beginning of the year making sure their students are caught up to the same place, wasting both the teacher's time as well as the time of students who are more prepared. This is avoided with teacher-designed summer assignments, as teachers will provide the same topic and type of work, allowing the students to enter the year at the same level of preparedness.

Another beneficial feature of teacher-designed summer assignments is that it allows the teacher to plan and pace the year's curriculum. This is possible because a teacher, when designing the year's lesson plan, will incorporate the summer assignments into it, usually using it as a segway into the year's curriculum. When students design their summer assignments, however, they will likely focus on different subjects picking a topic they're interested in rather than one that will lay the ground work for the upcoming year. This will result in the teachers having to spend extra time at the beginning of the year introducing certain topics and skills that should have been developed over the summer. In turn, this will cause teachers to rush towards the end of the year in attempts to cram all remaining information into their lessons, resulting in many areas being skipped over or barely taught.

Lastly, teacher-designed summer assignments are more beneficial than student-designed ones as they help train specific skills that will be useful in the class. When students design summer assignments, they will tend to chose topics and formats that fit their interests and skillset. While this helps to boost the student's productivity and creativity, it fails to equip them with the necessary tools to succed. Teacher-designed summer assignments, however, work to develop the skills essential to success in the class as well as an understanding of the course's themes. Entering the school year with a basic understanding of a class' essential skills to succeed will benefit a student much more than if they desgigned work that fortified their preexisting skills. This is especially important for advanced placement and dual enrolment classes, both of wich move at a rapid pace and will not spend extra time fortifiying skills that could have been developed over the summer, such as writing, research, analysis, etc.

While student-designed summer programs prove effective at stimulating student creativity and productivity, teacher-designed assingments are still superior at preparing the student for the upcoming school year. They provide a standard level of preparedness for students, ensuring that they enter a level playing field instead of having some students be far more prepared than others. Also, it allows for a teacher to plan their curriculum and pace it in a way that ensures no student feels rushed or left behind whil still teaching the information adequately. Most importantly, it allows students to develop certain skills that will set them up for success, especially in fast paced classes that wont spend extra time to fortify these skills. With all this in mind, it's clear that, to better prepare the students for the upcoming school year, tachers should be responsible for designing summer work assignments as they know how to prepare students best, based off the course and sklls it requires.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
4A926F657511,"A glass box. A glass box is what many teachers and schools put one in. While a student is in school there is never really much room for choosing ones path in their work. For all class work there is directions, for all project there is directions , and for all exams there is directions. Students never really get to design or create what they want to do for ones classes. Recently some schools have been testing the water to see what the benefits of having student- designed work by allowing students to design some summer projects. Although many might say it is not a smart idea to allow students to design summer projects because students will just always pick the easy way out, having a restrictive project with so many directions and rules will not benefit the student in any way, nor will it help the teacher. It does not help the students in any way because all the directions in a teacher designed project truthfully makes all the project cookie cutter, which in the long run is not helping anyone because it is not showing the teacher the true potential of the child. All school should allow student- designed projects because it allows students to express their creativity,it shows teacher the students strong suits, and it allows teachers to see what the student still needs help with.

Allowing a child to express their creativity is the single best way to get to know them and see what they are best at. For example for Generic_Name's summer project Mrs. Generic_Name let all of her students choose what they wanted to do for their project, and when school rolled around she was amazed with how thoughtful all the projects were. If Mrs. Generic_Name would have given the students a specific project they would all be boring and bland due to the fact that the students would have to follow a long list of directions. If teachers always put so many restrictions on all the students work it will never allow for them to grow and flourish to their full potential. Another examples for Mr. Generic_Name summer photography project, he allowed all of his students to bring him pictures of whatever they wanted, that year Mr. Generic_Name said he had gotten the best photos he had gotten in years. Because Mr. Generic_Name did not put his students in a box, it allowed them to all work with their strengths to get the best pictures they possibly could. If Mr. Generic_Name would have given the students specific directions of the photos he wanted they would have not came out as amazing because all the students would have the pressure off getting the exact picture that was being asked for, instead of their work coming naturally. Allowing creativity to flow through students work really allows them to flourish into their best selves.

By allowing students to design their own summer project it shows the teacher the students strong suits. Mrs. Generic_Name told her upcoming art class to do whatever they are best at. By Mrs. Generic_Name giving her students a chance to pick their project all of her students pulled through and showed her all their strengths. If she were to have designed the project herself she would have never found out all of the students strengths and she would have spent valuable class time teaching things that the students already know. Mr. Generic_Name told his class that they could write their summer English essay on anything they wanted. He choose to allow the students to chose their summer project because he knew they would show off all they have, and use the writing techniques that they know best. By not restrictions his students Mr. Generic_Name has the ability to see the best in everyone's essays. By having the student designed summer project it really allows teachers to see the talent behind each student.

Along with helping teachers discover what each students strengths are, having student-designed project also allows teachers to see what a student still needs help with. Generic_Name AP bio teacher Mrs. Generic_Name said that for the students summer project they can do anything using all the information they learned the previous year. On the first day of school Mrs. Generic_Name saw that Generic_Name still needed help with learning about the cell cycle. If Mrs. Generic_Name would have a assigned a specific project for all the students she would have not found out that Generic_Name was really struggling with the cell cycle, which would have put him even farther behind in the class. The tenth grade math department allowed their students to make the summer project for the rising tenth graders. By having the students make the summer project it ensures that only critical information is getting reviewed, and if the student does not know something it alerts the teacher that in the beginning of the year they need to review the material. Also by taking the summer project out of the teachers hands it also helps teachers figure out what they need to help students with, because with many years of teaching, teachers often forget what students need help with. With the freedom of having a student designed project it really helps the teachers out by picking out the students weaknesses and helping them focus on improvement.

By allowing students to take control of their summer project it allows the maximum amount of creativity and it shows the strengths and weaknesses of each student. Having teacher designed projects will never truly allow students to be as creative as the can be. With the student designed projects teachers will easily find what the students strong suits are and they will help the student enhance their talents. And lastly having student designed projects will also allow teachers to see what the student is still struggling with and create a plan of improvement. Many times having the freedom in ones hands to be able to choose what one does givers one the power to completely blow everyone's expectations out of the water. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
BF4D8E461594,"Everyone loves to come up with their own ideas, I mean who doesn't? I know I do ! Every year, in school there's always that one student in your class who says, "" Why cant I make my assignment my own?, I am exhausted from following these rubrics every single project that I have! "" That right there is just the problem. Students don't want projects all the time that they have to follow certain guidelines from the teacher, especially during their summer break. When it comes to assigning a project over the summer, letting the student designing their own project wouldn't hurt anyone, especially since students don't want work over the summer at all. The idea of summer projects being student-designed is valid because students are most likely to complete the project and gain more excitement from their own ideas.

Teachers may say that some students in the school environment don't want to complete their work because they are to lazy or just don't want to do it, but most of the time if the student isn't interested in the project then why would they complete something they aren't interested in? Students who have more control over the projects they are assigned to are more likely they are to complete it than following a rubric the teacher gave them. High school students normally who have AP assigned projects over the summer always are stressed about what projects they have to complete. You see it on social media all the time. They wait until the last minute to do it because of how the teacher designed the project. Furthermore, students generate better ideas from their own other than from someone else.

I don't think I have ever seen a friend or myself excited about any project assigned to them or myself unless I am coming up with it. Most of the time students surprise themselves from what they come up with on their own. In a 5th grade science fair project, students have to come up with what they are experimenting and see the results from what they come up with. Half of the time they are nervous think it's going to fail, but in the end when it turns out great and awarded for their work they are surprised with their outcome. Letting students design their own projects can make students realize what they are capable of creating.

Some may say teacher designed projects are laid out and organized better than what a student can produce; however, students designing their own projects gives them a better chance at letting them explore the ideas they can generate on their own. Students should have the ability and responsibility of doing this to challenge their brain more and not just having to follow a rubric off a teacher based assignment.       ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
EC36C2737376,"Students want to enjoy their summer break, but when summer projects are assigned, it is hard to do so. Which is why students should be in charge of designing their own summer projects. This will help students develop responsibility as well as keep their minds refreshed on educaton and open doors for different careers.

Firstly, responsibility is a beneficial trait that test one's ability to complete tasks. Giving pupils the ability to create and do projects on their own will strengthen the skill of responsibility. It will help the students further apprciate being able to design their own summer projects.

Secondly, having students in charge of creating projects for themselves keeps their minds refreshed on education. Students tend to forget what they learned from their previous school year during the summer. Allowing students to stay busy during the summer will further prepare them for the upcoming school year.

Thirdly, letting students be in charge of their own proects will more than likely open doors for their future. If some students desire to persue a career in education, they can develop the skills for that career through having control of their own summer projects. They can learn how to assign projects to their future students.

However, many may say that allowing students to be in charge of their summer projects is a bad idea. They infer that the teacher should be in charge of creating the projects due to the experience teachers have over ther students. In contrast, allowing students to create their own projects over teachers alow the students to challenge their brains, therefore, developing their education.

In summary, developing responsibility, opening career paths and keeping an open mind on education are valid reasons for allowing students to design their own summer projects over teachers. Teachers should allow students to be independent and let them be in control of their education. This will lead to a more advanced and updated education for school systems in the future.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
A1F9F72D3938,"Some schools have came up with the idea to do summer projects over their break. The only problem is, should teachers design these projects or should students do them on their own? Students designing their own projects can create a great way to start their summer off. Most students like having a responsibility over the summer. Students will most likely do a project, if they can design it themselves. A student designing their own project will add a lot of fun and creativity into it. Required school projects over the summer is not fun, but a student-designed project is better than a teacher-designed.

Over the summer, some students do not have anything to do or anywhere to go. Sitting at home all summer, with nothing to do, can get boring fast. Students are at home all day, thinking of different ways to create an awesome summer project. The responsibility of the project will weigh heavy on their minds, which will make them remember to do it. When students are responsible for something, especially if it is a grade, they will do everything possible to make sure it is done on time. Having the whole summer to think about this project, will get the creative juices flowing.

Students will not think about a project that a teacher assigned, because they will not have much room to think outside of the box. They will dread having to do the project which will cause them to lean more towards not doing it. If the assigned topic of the summer project is something a student is not interested in, they will let it slip their mind. Most school projects teachers assign to students lack interest and thought because the student did not find the topic of choice pleasing to them. When students are told what to do their projects on, they become less interested because now they are not able show their skills of creativity and knowledge. These projects should be thought of by students to show what they know.

This self-thought-of project will show teachers how creative their students are. Students will think outside the box to make sure theirs will not resemble or look like anybody else. Everybody would have something different to show when it is time to present the projects. These creative projects will teach other students things they never knew about. Students will show many emotions, especially eagerness, when they see what their other peers have thought of. In order for students to show their differences, they must pull out their creativity.

Projects are not something students enjoy doing, but if they have the chance to create their own they would enjoy that better. Having a responsibility over the summer is great for most students. Students will most likely do a project, if they can design it themselves. A student designing their own project will add a lot of fun and creativity into it. Everybody will enjoy the summer projects, if students made their own. Teachers will love the differences between all of the projects, and students will love the creativity they used to make the project. Smiling faces and excitement will enter the room when it is time to present.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
DDE5F76CAE87,"I'm in the 11th grade and have been doing summer projects since 8th grade. I either sometimes get great projects or I get a project that I don't even feel like because it doesn't interest me at all. Since 8th grade I have never gotten a summer project that is designed by me, but I know that this is the best for me and my teacher's. I know that it's better for my teacher's to design my summer projects because If I was able to do my own summer projects, my projects would be simple and not get any growth in my learning at all, and if my teacher's design my summer projects, I guarantee that the projects would be beneficial for me. I haven't always gotten a project that is for me but it does make my learning grow which is what I always want.

The reason I would not like to design my own project is mainly because they wouldn't benefit me in any way in learning. I would make my project really simple that it would most likely take a day and not help me in my learning. for example, when I get asked if I would rather have my sandwich or my mother's sandwich, It's always going to be my mother's because she knows what is best for me and she knows how to make a sandwich better than I would. If I were to make my own sandwich, my bread wouldn't be toast, I would put to much mayonnaise, and I would finish making my sandwich in less than two minutes. Thats the reason I would have my mom's because she would take her time and make it perfect, same goes with my teacher's; I know that they'll make my project better than mine. The reason that they'll make the project better is because they'll make sure that I'll get learning experience form it, it'll be a difficult project but beneficial, and my teacher's would make sure that they have everything in their project and not make up a project in five minutes. That's why its better for my teacher's to design the project instead of the student's like me.

The most important reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is because the projects would be beneficial for every student. For example, last year my teacher's gave me study guides for my test that were coming up. I was able to make excellent grades by studying the study guides. Now this year in 11th grade my teacher's don't give me anymore study guides, and I have to study without a study guide. This makes it so much more difficult now to study and my grades are lowering because of this. It's way much more beneficial when the teacher's give me a project or a study guide to do because they make sure I benefit from it. When I design my own project or study guide it's harder to benefit from it because it's either i'm to lazy or just can't make a good project to help me out and learn from it. This is why all teacher's should design my projects and every other students because they'll make sure you learn what your suppose to.

Since 8th grade I've been doing my summer projects designed from my teacher's, and honestly Im so glad that they can make the project design because I would be lazy and not really try to make a good project and my project wouldn't have the same benefits that if my teacher's designed them. I got to give a lot of credit to teacher's because they have to spend so much time trying to figure out a perfect project that can suit me and all my classmates. They also have to make it beneficial by assuring me that I get to learn from the summer project. I would totally let my teacher's keep designing my summer projects because if I was able to do my own summer projects, my projects would be simple and not get any growth in my learning at all, and if my teacher's design my summer projects, I guarantee that the project would be beneficial for me.          ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
CC7F0C052EBC,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to continue learning during summer vacation. How would you like it if your son or daughter came home and told you that they have a summer project that needs to be completed? Most of the students would rather have the project be student based due to it bringing out their creativity and their personality better.

First and foremost, creativity is one of the most valuable part about some because without creativity what is a person. Creativity needs to be looked upon on because if you do not have any creativity what new ideas could you come up with. On that hand, they can pick what they want to do as a summer project so they could be interceded to do it because its showing what they can do as a person and how creativity they are as a student at that school. What can a teacher do if he or she does not have any creativity in the classroom? when you look at schools today they are more worried on, how can I get this student to pass, or, how can i get this child to get a B on this paper.

Secondly, students would gather together and say that being able to pick what they want to do as their project would say that it brings out their personality better. They would have the choice to chose what they want to do as their summer project they would chose to do it on by themselves with no one telling them what they have to do. It would bring independence in the classroom due to everyone having their own ideas and thoughts that could show in the way they do their summer projects. The students have more of a variety to pick form because they can have their own ideas on their summer projects.

However, a very little hand full would say that they would love for their teacher to give them a summer project that the teacher picks for them because they do not have any independence to do what they want to. They need someone with them to help hem all the time and does not do anything in the classroom or at home because they have someone there to do it for them. But on the other hand you have students that are willing to take the challenge and conquer it because they have discipline and independence in their lives and are willing to do things on their own.

To finish everything off, most students would say that have creativity and personality are the two best best things to have because without them how could you go day living like you lived yesterday. For most people they want to be nothing alike most people because, what is the point of fitting in when you can stand out and still get things done that you could have got done with a group. The number one thing that matters here is that teachers need to let students do what they want to do as far s projects go because if you look at it students get better grade when they do it on themselves other than with a teachers help. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
AB5069821C4E,"Summer projects are a burden that take away students time during the summer to relax and hang out with their friends and families. A lot of schools struggle with what to assign as summer reading or projects because they want the students to learn but don't like when students turn in sloppy work that they completed the week before school starts. School systems wonder whether student-designed projects will adhance students learning throughout summer break. Although some may believe otherwise summer projects should be student-designed because students know how much time they have over the summer and students will have a greater benefits from them.

Summer assignments should be student-designed as students know how much time they have over the summer to spend on school work. Last summer my friend Generic_Name was very busy as she had a leadership role at a summer camp for two weeks, she camped for a week, and she had volleyball practice everyday in August. As the first day of school was approaching Generic_Name realized that she still had to read a book and answer questions on it for school. Many students, just like Generic_Name, have very busy summers and often have trouble finding time to complete those boring teacher-designed projects. If summer projects were student designed, students could create a project that fit into their schedule rather than long projects that took away from their time to themselves. Another example showing that summer projects should be student designed is my cousin Generic_Name. Generic_Name lives in California and last year her school started a new initiative where they left summer projects in the hands of the students. The students designed a project where everyone had to create a presentation showing what they did over the summer and how those activities impacted them. With this project, Generic_Name didn't have to go out of her way to complete it as she just had to take photos and journal about the many things she was doing over the summer, which made this project fun and easy for her. The students at her high school created this project as they knew it wouldn't take away from the students time to relax, go on vacation, and hangout with their friends and families. In the past, Generic_Name would never complete her projects as she simply didn't have the time to do it because the teachers were assigning reading projects with long packet that analyzed the assigned book. Overall, students brains will be better stimulated over the summer if their projects are student-designed because they will be more motivate to find time to complete the projects.

Students will have greater benefits from student-designed projects as they can chose what subjects they need to work on and they can create projects the interest them. My cousin Generic_Name struggles in math but excels in English. While she was in middle school and high school the projects she was assigned over the summer were all reading projects, which were easy for her. She would have benefited more if she could have chosen to complete a math packet that would prepare her for the next grade level. Instead, year after year she completed the same reading packet that had no effect on her. Emily is similar to all students as everyone has their strengths and weaknesses, so if students are required to complete a summer assignment it should be something that will actually increase their intellectual abilities by strengthening their weaknesses. Another example of student-designed projects having greater benefits is my friend Generic_Name who really enjoys photography. Last year, Generic_Name high school, in Arkansas, let each student create their own summer project to present to their homeroom class the first week of school. Generic_Name decided to a presentation on the history of photography and share photos she took over the summer which benefited Generic_Name as she grew her photography skills so that she could impress her classmates with the photos she took. It also allowed her to advance her photography skills as she was inspired by photographers from past time period and she read their tips and tricks. Generic_Name summer project shows that students benefit more from summer assignments when they are able to design them rather than when teachers design projects that won't individually benefit each student. Overall, students do not benefit from projects that don't spotlight their interests and needs.

Some may believe that teacher-designed p assure learning over break because they believe that teachers know what students need to do stimulate their brains. While this reasoning is understandable, it is false because when students are able to design their own projects that focus on their interest and needs they are more likely to benefit from them and they are more likely to put aside the time to complete them. Two years ago, over the summer I spent a week on my dad's boat, I spent a week at summer camp, and I hung out with my friends. All those activities took up the majority of my summer. Summer went by so fast and before I knew it there was a week until school started and I still hadn't read the book we were assigned. If my summer project would have been student-designed I could have made it so that it fit my needs and interest. By doing so I would have continue to learn throughout the summer rather than over two days at the end of break. All schools should have student-designed projects if they actually want students to learn over break and turn in well done projects.

Student-designed projects are more beneficial to all schools systems. Before schools started allowing student-designed projects teachers were receiving either no projects or sloppy ones. The future with student-designed projects will benefit teacher and students as students will come in ready to learn with effort filled projects. Students know how to create a project that will fit their interests and the time they have available over the summer.        ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
C0493529C98A,"Summer is a time of fun, and relaxation. It is also a time where you stop using your brain, which then leads you to forgot a lot of critical information, when it comes to school. Which explains why some schools require kids to do these summer projects, but the only way this project will be useful, is if the project is teacher-designed, rather than student-designed.

I remember my 8th grade summer so well, because I did not do a single thing when it came to school. I was either sleeping, watching TV, or hanging out with friends. Although it was a very fun summer, I was not prepared for my freshman year of highschool. This lead to me having a very hard year when it came to my grades, and this all stems from me being lazy and ignornant, when it came to the difficulty to highschool. I am sharing this information because if the summer project was student-designed, the students would make it very easy, and not work their mind in the places they need to, which would lead them to being behind the ball in school. Teachers on the other hand, would challenge the student's mind, and give the student important information that he/she will need to know for the next grade. This would give the student a big head start going into the next grade that will prove very helpful in the long run. Although the student will be annoyed at first, in the end, the student will be thanking the teacher for giving them important and maybe even interesting information.

One issue with today's education, is that kids don't think outside the box, so if the summer project was controlled by the teacher, they could assign a project that could allow the student to think outside the box, and open up about their beliefs. In today's education, students are treated like robots. You take a bunch a notes, do homework, and then take a test to wrap up that unit, and repeat until the year is over. This is not the teachers fault, because they are required to teacher everything they are told to do. This does not allow the teachers to be creative, and allow the students to think in ways they usually don't. So while you could argue tha teachers could have another boring project over the summer, I think that the teachers would be estatic, to be able to fully control the the outline and rubric of the project, that would help expand the minds of the students.

Summer break is a time for fun and relaxation, but it is also a time to keep your mind sharp, and that would not happen if a student controlled the project, because they would assaign a project that would be super easy, and take very little effort. While if the teacher controlled the project, they would help the student be prepared for the next grade, and help the student think in ways they probably didn't think before. Which is why the summer project should be teacher-designed.  ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
E16FF3DF1166,"Once the school year ends, students have a large break to look forward to: summer. These hard-worked students have time to unwind, relieve stress, and spend time with their loved ones. However, it is also imperative that students do some sort of school-related work in order to prevent the ""summer slide,"" a loss of knowledge over the summer break if no schoolwork or unhelpful work is done. A question then arises: ""Should these assignments be designed by the students or by the teachers?"" Both sides have some very compelling supports to them, but one stands out above the other. Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because of the insurance that the students will have enough work to prevent summer slide, the easier access to studies to show the best options for assignments, and the fact that teacher-designed summer assignments are more traditional than student-designed work.

These may seem like some very strong points to support this side, but some people show aversion to teacher-designed assignments. This opposing side's main point is that students will know what students need and want to learn over the summer. While this may seem like a logical statement, teacher-designed assignments are just as student-centric as student-designed assignments. Many students enjoy the current trend of reading assignments over the summer, which is a teacher-designed assignment. Other assignments, such as mathematics problems or science-based work, are equally enjoyable, if not more so. For example, these science-based assignments often cover topics that have been shown to deeply interest students, such as observing aspects of nature for certain biology classes. Because of this student enjoyment, teacher-designed assignments are as good or more so than student-designed assignments, which proves the previous argument about students knowing what other students enjoy as misled.

Summer assignments should be designed by teachers because they ensure that students will have enough work for summer slide to not affect them. If these assignments are student-designed, they may not have enough work involved to prevent knowledge from leaking during the summer break. This is because students may feel sympathetic towards others and selfish towards themselves, thereby not giving enough or any work in order to only relax over the summer, not having to worry about any upcoming work. It may sound like a good idea to simply let students unwind without work, but summer slide is a serious problem, with many students over the course of the summer losing key facts that play a large role towards their future classes. One student, for example, failed to do any math-related assignments over a summer break. When he returned, he reported that he did not know many of the concepts required to do most of the work in his higher math class, even though these concepts were taught in the previous year. A teacher-designed assignment that keeps these concepts fresh in the mind would prevent this from happening, and they often do prevent this. They do this by using the next supporting point: easy access to studies that show the best assignments.

Teacher-designed assignments are superior to student-designed work because teachers have easy access to studies that show which assignments work to stop summer slide, and which ones do not. While many of these studies could be found via a quick internet search, teachers have entire volumes of these studies to look over, many of which cannot be accessed from the internet. When asked, one teacher stated, ""Most of the work that we assign to students, whether it be over the school year or over the summer, has come from years and years of seeing what works and what doesn't, along with some testing to ensure that what we think works does in fact work. Right now, we have a pretty good understanding of what does."" As stated, the testing (studies) has shown that modern teacher-designed assignments work to prevent summer slide. Student-designed assignments, on the other hand, do not have such access to these tests or these studies, so they may not know what will work and what will not. Another factor to consider when toying with the idea of student-led work is that, for the most part, people (and schools) are fairly averted to change.

Teacher-designed work should stay the norm for summer assignments because they are the norm, and many public bodies show aversion to change. This aversion mainly stems from the uncertainty about student work, as supported by the last two points supporting teacher-designed assignments. When performed, studies showed that much of the staff and students at schools preferred teacher-designed assignments due to their tried-and-true formula. Like the previous point, students may not know what to do for these assignments, while teachers have proven that they do know what to do. This aversion to change is also shown in other parts of school, such as the argued subject of changing paper-based learning to online-based learning. This subject has plenty of essays covering it on its own, but does show that people don't enjoy changing from a more traditional form of work to a form that has not proven its worth.

In conclusion, teacher-designed assignments should be used for summer work because they ensure that students will have enough work to do, they are supported by decades of work and studies, and they are more traditional than student-designed assignments. Summer work may seem like a chore to do because of summer's purported break from school. However, these assignments are crucial to doing well in school, and as proven before, teachers know best for these kinds of things. To support these teacher-designed assignments, go out and suggest that they should continue to be used to student bodies and school administrations. Summer slide can be stopped, and the evidence shows that teachers are the best source for ways to stop it.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
86D1F207868B,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Some people may feel that it is better to have these projects student-designed rather than designed by the teacher themselves. Both project criterias have their positves and negatives, but the teachers should be the ones making the assignment. Now while a student-designed project has its benefits, the teachers should be designing the assignments because what is best for the student and the material the students must know before coming to the class.

This statement could be countered with a claim that states that the students should design these assignments to help insure that they better understand the material. The students could make a project that is accustomed to their own personality and the way they think. The students making the project may help the information get through to them better than the teacher could. Both ideas have great benefits and help the student in their own way.

The teachers know what is best for the student and the material they need to be successful in the course. The students may confuse themselves because they haven't actually learned the information yet. The students don't know exactly what the course is actually about. The teachers know the material and everything the student will learn during the course of the year.

The teachers have spent years familiarizing themselves with the information and have gone to college to learn this stuff. The student has not yet taken the course and is not as familiar with the information as the teacher is. The student would be more beneficial by having the teacher tell them what they need to know and learn before taking the course. I believe these things because the teacher has more experience in this field than the student does.

Overall, both ideas are great and really help them learn the material well, I just believe that the student would be better off by having the teacher design the assignment. The teachers know exactly the material the student needs to know to be successful in the course. The teacher have spent years familiarizing themselves with the information invoved in the course. The teachers should be designing the assignments because what is best for the student and the material the student must know before coming to the class.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
DBA70364DC32,"Some schools require their students to complete a project created by their teacher over the summer. I believe that the projects should be student designed. 1, because the student can make the project based on what he or she struggled on the most through out the school year. 2, the student can add their own details and present it the way he or she wants.

First, the student shoukd make the project because, that students knows what they need to work on. the student would make the project denificial to them, help the do better. Nine times out of ten the teacher would make the same project for the entire class. And if that that student has Aced that subject, in what way is this project helping the student? No way.

Second, the student would be able to make the project look however he or she wanrts it to look. Add there own touch to it, and add specific detasils to their ptoject. Most of the time thye teacher would make the project simople and boring. Now a days kids like detail and actually care about their work

However, I understand why teachers like to be the ones to create their students project. As kids we tend to forget the point of view of the project and start writing about things that the teacher didnt even ask. Things that were not even on the check list. And there is a chance that if you let the student create their own project, they might end up not even doing the project.

In conclusion, yes it would be smarter to let the teacher create the project on their own(sometimes), but as time goes there are some really smart and intellegent kids and young adults out their that would love to make their own project. And their creation/version of the project; just might be better that the teachers.

0EF652533E77,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. I think the projects should be teacher designed because the project will designed for what they need to learn and the students will better understand the project if the teacher makes the project.

Firstly, If the teacher designs the project it is better because the teachers know what the students need to learn, so the project instructions will be clear on what needs to be done and what the requirements are. Studies show that the brain is not fully developed until 18. Teenagers need structure, so having the teacher create the project provides that structure.

Lastly, I feel if the project is teacher made the students will more likely do the project. I say this because students are lazy, we procrasnate too much. If a teacher has already planned it out and just tells us what to do, we'll feel more oblagated to do it. Also I feel the project would be taken more serious since a teacher assigned and created the project.

I'd like to add that letting students design their own projects could have some benefits. It could give students a chance to prove that they know the subject and have actually learned. But I think havig the project teacher designed overall would be better because in my case I would like to know what the teacher would like to see from me.

In concuslution, I think that summer projects should be teacher designed because the students will more likely do it and the project will be clear about what the teacher wants to see.          ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
B4C5B9F3FB4E,"Will students learn more if they design their own projects? Some schools require students to work over the summer to assure they keep learning and can come prepared for a new school year. However, most of the time these projects are designed by teachers, making them boring and repetitive. Students will be able to plan and find a good solution to create a project that will be easy for them to finish. They will not just be learning about a certain subject, but they will be also learning new skills. While some people might think that summer projects should be teacher-designed; it is a better option if they are student-designed because it helps them work on creativity, teaches them to work as a team, and gives them the opportunity to learn their own way.

Students will work on their creativity, while thinking on ways of learning. Projects are made so students can develop what they are studying in a certain class, but these can be boring sometimes. This idea makes students work and think like teachers, by creating activities that will help them continue gaining knowledge. I can be creative when I am given the opportunity. Designing a project, is a fun way for me to think and come up with different ideas to create a project that will help me and my peers to learn.

Working as a team it's a big part of life. Everywhere you go, you will have to work with other people. This can be at school, college, work, if you play a sport, if you do theater, etc. Working as a team requires of many skills: being patient, a good listener, and supportive. Many students, around the world, focus on themselves and are too individualist, or they just don't know how to relate with other people. Most of the time, the main reason of this is that they are shy and introverts. Fun activities, like this one, will help them be more open about it, and will help them work with their peers since they want to achieve a common goal.

This is a good opportunity for students to learn their own way. Most teachers leave many activities for students to do over the summer, without caring that this is their only long vacation after an exhausting year. For example, these activities are hard and too long; it gets to the point that students can't have fun because they are stressing out in order to finish these projects. Students are limited by the activities made by teachers; and creating a project is the perfect opportunity for them to think about everything they've learned without making it too complicated to solve. Most important, they will have the freedom to create a project without getting limited by their teachers.

Some people might say summer projects should be teacher-designed because they have more knowledge than students; however, they should be student-designed because it helps them develop new skills while learning at the same time. Summer time it's supposed to not be stressful for students; therefore they shouldn't be worrying about doing a project that takes long to finish. If students make their own projects, they can start off by thinking how much time they will be able to focus, during vacation, to finish school work; and finally they will come up with the perfect project for them. Learning can also be fun, specially if students will contribute with each other for a good purpose.             ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
32C09B35C142,"Imagine the average student during the summer. They're thriving and enjoying the warm sun and warm waters. A new school year is coming soon and the thought of summer projects loom over their minds like a dark cloud. They put it off until the very last moment and their procrastination rewards them with a barely passing assignment to turn in on the first week of school. Now imagine if the students were able to determine what kind of projects they did. Although letting students create their own projects, it defeats the purpose of assigning them in the first place. Projects should be teacher-designed because it prepares students, informs teachers of what kind of students they have entering their classes, and makes sense because only the teachers know the upcoming curriculum that the students are required to learn.

To begin, summer assignments from teachers prepare students. It can give then a feel of what they will be learning. It can also foreshadow the type of work they will receive and what expectations the teachers will have of them. Things always come more naturally and quicker when people see them coming and are able to mentally and physically prepare for them. Students can gather materials and do research on whatever topic their project is on and go into class on the first day of school knowing exactly what they're getting into. Not only that, but entering with knowledge about the course already. It can also prepare them by boosting their grades in the first week of school and start them off with a good grade to build off of.

Not only do summer assignments prepare students but they also prepare teachers by informing them about the upcoming students. The moment assignments are due, teachers instantaneously gain information about the characteristics of their students. They can see the work ethic within the quality of the work and the people who don't even attempt to do the work. They hear the procrastination in the excuses of those wishing to slide in late work. Therefore, it gives teachers an idea of who really cares about their classes and grades.

Lastly, although students designing their own projects would make it easier for them, they don't actually know what they need to be learning for the upcoming school year. Students would make up a random assignment they already have knowledge about so they could finish it quickly and efficiently without putting in any real work. But summer assignments exist to assure students continue to learn during their break. Having them assign work to themselves would defeat the purpose of doing summer projects. Teachers, however, know exactly what they need to know in order to move on to the next grade. Students would be able to learn useful information required for the upcoming year instead of wasting their time and the teachers time with work that doesn't actually teach anything.

In conclusion, teacher-designed projects prepare students and teachers for the upcoming year by introducing the qualities of the classroom environment such as: the work, expectations, and characteristics of individuals in the class. Students learn what the teachers expect of them and teachers learn what to expect about the students. Even though student input is very helpful in many situations and can improve methods of teaching, it is not required in this particular topic. It is in the best interest in all parties involved for teachers to create the projects the students have to complete. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8

If the project is teacher-design, the teachers will be able to pick what the topic of the project will be about.

They can pick something like animals, math, shoes, or their favorite store and why it's their favorite. Furthermore, they can do a project on any one of those or anything they would like to do.

Instead of listening to the teacher on how and what to do, they can just listen to themselves because it's a student-designed project and they can just follow their own rules. Students may have a manual script on how to do their project. Some students make a list on what they have to do in order for them to do their project so they won't mess up. The students also don't have to worry about if they have to do a lot of work on their project. They can decide if they have to do a lot work or not because it's their project. Some kids don't like to do a lot of work but, they won't have to worry about that because this time they get to decide on if their project would be a lot of work or not.

The teacher's could give them a project that's school related or not school related. They get to decide if they want the students to be creative and colorful. Most teachers want want their students to be creative in their project because it can give them more points added to their grade at the end. Also, they get to decide what kind of format it's going to be on like: line paper, drawing paper, a poster board, or on a computer. Right after the the teacher assign the project, they would tell the students what kind of format they want it to be on.

CBF7A08C8352,"Summer assignments have been a school-standard for long time. Most (if not all) honors or AP course give students summer assignments in preparation for the course. However, a conversation that has been brought to the attention of educators is whether or not students should begin to design their own summer assignments. For years now, teachers have designed these assignments with specific instructions in mind, but how would students structure these assignments? How would students create an assignment that would occupy themselves over the 3 month break? It's best to keep to tradition and let the teachers create these assignments, since teachers are professionals who know how to create proper assignments and it would prevent students from purposely making easy assignments that are made just for the sake of getting the assignment over with.

First of all, teachers know how assignments in general should be made. They know that they have to make an assignment that challenges the student in order to jog their memory on material that will be important to remember for next year's course. They design these assignments that are purposely time consuming and long so that students can pace themselves throughout the summer. It's an effective structure that works and has been done for years. It would be best if it remained the same.

Secondly, if students began to create their own summer assignments, they would create shorter and easier assignments. As a student myself, I can say without a doubt that most students do the work to get it done with. If students were ever granted the option to make their own summer assignment, then they would create an assignment that could be completed in a day. That's not to say all students would do that, but students would rather spend their summer not doing a 60 question math packet with a bunch of two part questions. So, if students were granted the option of making their own packets, then there is probably a chance that they would create assignments that are quick and easy.

In conclusion, let's just stick to tradition and let the teachers design summer assignments the way they always have, to prevent students from making easy assignments that can be done in a day and because teachers already do a fine enough job of making summer assignments. Why change how things work, when there is really no need for change. Students are students, they are the learners; so don't give them the teacher's job. If a student was ever given a chance to change how summer assignments are usually structured then they would probably abuse that position.

1C592378CBD1,"After going to school for ten months, students need a bit of a break before starting up again. Not only are their bodies tired, but so are their minds. Their minds are basically at capacity! So when summer break rolls around, students tend to leave everything they learned behind. While understandable to want to stop putting more information in their brain, students should never leave what they know behind. Students work so hard for a long time, to gain new information and more knowledge. In order to assure continued learning, teachers assign summer projects. Unfortunately, students decide to not do the assigned summer projects because it tends to get in the way of their summer. So, what if the switch was flipped and students could create their own summer projects? Students should have the freedom to complete their own summer assignments because, they're more likely to do the project when it's their own, students can express their own creativity, and they will actually enjoy doing their project.

If students could create their own assignments, they would actually do the work to get it done. They have all summer to come up with a fun project idea, so why not make it the greatest one possible? Fast-forwarding to when school starts up again, students will have a completed project to present to their teachers and peers. They won't only be happy for the grade, but they'll be proud of themselves for completing their project. Adding to the positive, teachers will have a better impression of what their students do. Meaning that teachers will know how to operate their classes, based on their students and how they learn.

Students will also be able to express their creativity freely. For example, one student may not be able to color, paint, or draw, while another student is really good at coloring, painting, and drawing. The student who isn't as good at doing those things, may be better at using computers to create things. So that student should be able to complete his/her summer assignment, on his/her terms. Some teachers assume that all students are capable of doing only one thing, which is very untrue and unrealistic. Students should not be limited to doing one thing, in one way. It's unfair that some teachers grade based on how artistic the assignment is, or how technological it is. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Teachers should look towards all their students specific strengths, instead of aiming at their weaknesses. Plus, teachers should be very fond of students' creativity in their assignments, and grade them based on the student's hard work, the assignment criteria, and their creativity.

Lastly, students will actually enjoy working on their summer projects! Since they have their own freedom to create whatever the please, they can make it any way they want. On top of that, they'll have the whole summer to make their very own masterpiece. So, when working on the assignment, it won't seem like such a drag to have to complete. Students can also work at their own pace. Since students do have a solid three months to complete and revise their projects, there should be nothing less than perfection.

All in all, students should never stop learning new things. The new way of learning is expressed through creativity. Scott Fitzgerald once said,

""For what it's worth... it's never too late, or too early, to be whoever you want to be.

There's no limit

E4CE8E374B3A,"Students are required to complete summer projects for some classes. How can these projects be modified so that the student entirely benefits from them? Some say that these summer projects should be teacher-designed, while others say they should be student-designed. These projects should fit the student's individual needs. Summer projects should be student-designed because this will provide students with an opportunity to engage in their own learning and enjoy the process while they are at it.

Student-designed projects allow the student to take on a role in their own learning. It allows students to be creative and to think outside of the box. As the student is learning, a specific brain region, the frontal lobe is growing; this benefits the student. The student has flexibility while working on their assignment and is able to work at their own pace. It makes the student feel like their ideas matter and they are being heard because they are the ones taking on the initiative. Students have the ability to produce something great and they do not feel like they are just assigned busy work over break. As a student, I enjoy forming my own ideas and having the opportunity to learn on my own.

On the other hand, not only do these student-designed projects allow students to engage in their own learning, but they also provide enjoyment for the student. Since it is designed by the student, they will be willing to do the assignment on their own. Self-motivation will come into play because as a student, I know that if I enjoy doing something, I will put in my best effort. Upon completing the project, the student will have a sense of fulfillment and accomplishment. Many students do not put in time and effort into projects which are designed by teachers because they do not have the motivation and interest that is needed to complete the project. They do poorly on the project and that ends up taking a huge toll on their grade for the year.

Others argue that projects should be teacher-designed because the teacher knows what is best for the individual student and what material needs to be covered in the project. Doing a project which is teacher-designed allows the teacher to help the student if the student has any questions; the teacher has knowledge about the subject of the project. Teacher-designed projects allows the teacher to instruct students to include certain ideas in their projects which will benefit them for the topics that will be covered during the school year. Another great benefit is that the teacher is allowed to set deadlines which helps keep the student on track. Sometimes from a student-designed project, students might not get a lot of learning out of it because they might do a project on a topic that has nothing to do with the class that they have been assigned to do a project for. This will not assure continued learning during summer break, in fact, it will have an adverse effect.

Overall, considering the pros and cons of both; the benefits of student-designed summer projects outweigh the benefits of teacher-designed summer projects. Students will be able to articulate their own ideas and who knows; maybe they might make something great out of it. Summer is for enjoyment and a student-designed summer project allows the student to do just that. By the time the school year starts, students will be able to take on whatever comes their way; their learning process will be strengthened due to their self-designed summer project.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8

If the project is assigned by the teacher it will make the student work harder. There are those who argue student-assigned summer projects would be better. Although some may disagree, teacher-assigned summer projects would be better.

There a variety of ways teacher-assigned summer projects are better. The teacher will ensure it is challenging. When the teacher assigns the work they will make sure the assignment is not very easy. Teacher-assigned work makes students actually try. Also, it will be more beneficial for knowledge if the teacher assigned it. If the teacher assigns the work the student could possibly learn something new. The student will benefit from the new information they learned. It will insure the student does their best work. If teacher assigns something one can not be mediocre or their grade on the assignment suffer from it. The teacher assigning the work makes the student want to do their best.

There are more reasons why teacher-assigned summer projects are better. The student has no choice but to take the assignment serious . The student will make it important and take it serious. If the teacher assigns it the student will not put it in the back of their mind; they will make it a top priority. The student would not procrastinate. If teacher assigns it the student will not take a long time to complete the assignment. In contrast, if an student assigned it they will probably forget about it or do it at the last minute. Also, many teachers take off points for the assignment being late so students make sure it is done in a timely manor.

Although some may disagree, teacher-assigned summer projects are more beneficial. Teacher-assigned summer projects will ensure the student learns over the summer and not slack off. There those who argue otherwise, that believe student-assigned summer projects are better. Many know that when a teacher assigns work that it will be completed better than if it was assigned by a student.    ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
8DFC402F09AB,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects. These projects are given to assure that students still get an education over their timely break. Students should be able to design their own projects because it is imaginative, keeps them interested, and teaches them to be an individual.

Schools that require summer projects from students should let the students pick and design their projects because it uses their imagination. Over the summer, students get bored and do not know how to spend all of their time. With a project to plan on their hands, they can put everything in their heads onto paper, or even into art form. If the student travels over the summer, they can do a project on the history of where they traveled to. Maybe the student just stayed home and played video games all summer. That is okay; they can come up with a back story to the video game and do a project on that. Doing this will let their imaginations run wild.

Another reason why students should be able to design their own projects is because it would keep them interested. If the project was teacher-designed, the student may decide that it is too boring or hard and not do it. Student-designed projects give students the opportunity to do something that they are interested in. This will assure that they get it done, considering they get to pick the topic.

Student-designed projects also bring out individuality. When someone is picking your project for you, you do not have much say in what goes into it. Picking the project gives the student independence and diversity. They do not have to follow a list of guidelines that someone else has set up for them. The students get a chance to be themselves without teachers telling them exactly what to do. This will help them when they get out of high school because there will not always be an adult there to guide you through.

Many schools are starting to require assignments or projects to be done over the summer. These projects are made to make sure that students still learn over their break. All schools that require these types of summer projects should consider letting students design their own projects because they create a sense of imagination, keep students interested, and allow students be individuals.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
05F87BEFBD79,"The situation of giving away projects for students to do over summer is a very difficult task because in order to satisfy both ends some things may need to be sacrificed. Teachers should be the ones picking projects over students because how they know what is best for their students. In order to accept the needs and wants of both sides it is best to have the leader of it all to pick what to assign and what not to assign. If the immature students are able to pick what they get to do, their learning over summer will be endangered.

Teachers are best for picking what projects to give to students because they are able to base their decisions based on what the students need most over what they want most. Students picking may not be able to know what is best to develop because they have only been here once; furthermore, teachers are able to know what students need because they have taught for many years and are able to distinguish what is best for the students and what may end up in a lack or even a decline of progress for projects to do over summer.

Students picking what is best for their own projects may end in many ways. The students can make it seem like the work is helping and they are benefiting when they are actually just making it so easy that they can still get away with doing no learning over break if they pick the project. They may also make it based on what they need to work on but just make it super easy to a point where the work they do does not even benefit them. Either one of these is counterproductive and there should be a better option made. It can be seen in the book

The Perfect Storm how when people take on something where they are less experienced that they will fail to reach the goal that the group is hoping for; for example, in

The Perfect Storm the sailors all died because they were not experienced enough to take on a storm that big and were unprepared. a situation like this is just as likely with these less experienced students who may be picking their own projects to do over summer. If this is the case their ships may sink as well and they will not get the learning that they need over summer

The argument can be made that students are actually able to be responsible and that they should be able to pick their own projects. This point is very valid for the responsible students; contrasting this, the assertion can be made that out of every batch of students, there is always a bad egg. The irresponsible students, especially younger and more immature ones, should not be trusted with picking a somewhat annoying project to them, that will get in the way of their free time, time to hang out with friends, and time to play video games. This time is very important to them, especially over summer vacation, and they will do whatever they can to not have to do a lot of work and be able to relax.

In conclusion, the ability for teachers to control the students' projects allows for well planned projects that allow them to continue learning, which would otherwise be negatively affected if the students were the ones deciding. With the large education that those teachers were able to get in order to be there, it can be seen that a project given by them would be far more educational and productive than one made by the students. In order to make a good project to give, it takes experience and maturity, without these it would be like there is nothing useful being done for these students over summer.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
69F4D7B711FE,"Students should be given the opportunity to design their own summer projects because they would all learn from eachother while practicing teamwork, and this would allow them to choose a topic within their interest which would improve their performances and increase their effort towards the project.

For example, Once in my science class we were all given the opportunity to choose our own summer project topic as a class while doing our own research and designing our presentations. During the creating process, everyone reached out to eachother and used their personal skills and strengths to help one another and come together as a team. When it got to the time where we had to present at the, everyone's hard work and research, along with personal skill, we were able to do a great job by taking leadership and teaching each other new things without a teacher involved.

This shows that students can take leadership while working together without a teacher's ideas in the center of the project.

Students designing their own projects gives them the chance to choose a specific topic within their interests which would improve their performance and increase the amount of effort that they give towards the project.

For instance, while given the chance to choose my own topic during an individual project , I was able to focus more and put in more effort due to my motivation because I was able to do my project on the topic that I liked.

This proves that when students are given the chance to do something that they like and that interests them , their performance and effort may improve because it is the topic of their choice.

Some people say that teachers should design summer projects because they are more trustworthy and that students may just choose a topic that is easy and quick so that they can finish early.

However, they are wrong because teachers may choose a topic that students are not interested in and that the students may not understand, leaving more work to the teachers because they students may need extra assistance and may lack motivation.

For example, If a class is given a project on something they never learned in detail or showed interest in during class time and they have to research it over the summer, the class will not be motivated to put in much effort and will rely on the teacher for information, this will put more work on the teacher.

Giving students the opportunity to design their own summer projects more frequently should be considered, to improve their motivation and effort and to help them learn teamwork from each other.          ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
026D034610CE,"As the demand rises for higher level courses, teachers have formatted a new tool to prepare their students for the rigorous year to come: summer assignments. These projects can lay important groundwork for a course, or simply act as filling during the summer months. The distinction between the two is dependent on the experience of its creator and how much care is put into the creation of the assignment. Therefore, teachers should be entrusted with the duty of preparing summer projects for their students.

One of the crucial factors in this decision is how much of a higher quality of work a teacher can bring to the situation. As certified instructors, they know the intricacies of the course and what a student needs for a strong foundation for the year. Educators know from experience what information is needed to succeed, from the classroom to summer break. A student that has never taken the course would have little way of knowing what is important to delve into. Secondly, teachers have both education and real life experience in planning projects. They can utilize their college educations and invaluable prior years as a teacher in ways an inexperienced student cannot when it comes to creating an assignment from nothing. Enlisting a licensed, qualified educator would be much more advantageous then putting the responsibility in the hands of a student.

On the other hand, many students believe that they should be the ones directing their own home education. While the idea has some validity to it, it should not apply to situations akin to summer projects. When you take a course, there is a certain amount of responsibility placed on the instructor to do their part in teaching. Putting this responsibility on students would not be too different from asking them to create their own homework. In order to expect students to succeed, teachers must invest time into guiding their education. Also, an influential part of the effect of summer break assignments is the power it has to open new perspectives. The projects with the most impact leave one looking at the subject from a new point of view. If a student was to plan their own learning experience, they would not be able distance themselves from what they already know enough to create as much of a difference. Finally, a project needs strong guidelines to lead the student through the possibilities towards the information they started out for. Leaving the structure open for students to construct allows them to easily lose the purpose of the assignment and complete a project entirely different from the requirements of the teacher. This gaping hole in the process leaves students with poor grades on the project and without the head start needed for the class. Keeping instruction in the hands of those more qualified would better impact the students and set them up for success in the coming year.

In closing, allowing teachers to mandate summer projects would produce the best results in the students' learning. While allowing students to become more involved in their education through making their own decisions is important, it would not properly support them in the years to come. The experience and indispensable guidance of a qualified teacher in the creation of the assignment is imperative to the students' success. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9AF297830D8A,"The majority of students use their summer vacation as a time to take a break from constant learning and unwind by spending time with friends and family. Learning for the majority of the year can be mentally exhausting and induce stress upon students. Most of what students learn is directed by the teacher and students do not have the choice to pick what they want to learn about. Summer projects should be student-designed because it gives students the chance to express their creative abilities, motivation to complete the assignment, and they have the opportunity to learn what they are interested in.

Summer projects designed by students will allow for students to have the choice to express their creative abilities. Many individuals are creative, especially over the summer when students are outside either traveling or spending time with their loved ones because it can bring ideas of what to make the project about. I have experienced a burst of creativity during the summer, especially when traveling, because I get the opportunity to view and experience many new things that give me ideas to create a project. When I traveled to Puerto Rico, I saw the rich culture of Puerto Rican art and was inspired to create a project inspired by their culture. I have met other students who are extremely talented and have made art that is different than just a poster or painting. In seventh grade, I had the opportunity to create a project on plant cells and the objective was demonstrate the parts of a plant cell however we wanted, it was student-designed. I got an old book I have read multiple times, cut a hole inside the book and created a sculpture out of a plant cell within book. I received an excellent grade and my teacher was very fascinated by what I made. If students had the ability to make their own project, they would have the choice to make something that is out of the box and not be limited to what a teacher allows.

Student-designed projects could inspire a student to be more motivated to complete it to the best of their ability instead of leaving the project last minute made with minimum effort. Most students are more inclined to do something they like or want to do rather than do something they are forced or not want to do. When I am forced to work on an assignment I am not interested in, I tend to put it off and make it the last thing I need to do. Most of my peers are like this as well and tend to leave the assignment last minute leading up to a product that is not the best. One time at dance, I was given the opportunity to make a dance combination with any style of dance I chose and teach it to my peers in two weeks. Dance is something that I love so I was motivated to complete this assignment and made a dance combination within that week and put in maximum effort. If summer projects allow for a student to do what they love, then I am sure that more students will complete their assignment quicker and with maximum effort.

Students will have the chance to learn something they are interested in that could benefit their future careers if summer assignments were student-designed. Students creating a project they want can be beneficial because they can research and experience things they are interested in that could lead them to a career path. This could be extremely beneficial for seniors in high school who are undecided and are looking for internships to see what field of work they want to be in. I have met someone who had the choice to design her own summer project and she traveled to South America and taught dance classes there and that inspired her to go to school to become a professional dance teacher. This also insures that students are still learning over the summer, but are learning material that could benefit them and will not forget about. Student-designed summer projects have many upsides and could decrease the amount of undecided students and help guide individuals to choose the right path for themselves.

Student-designed summer projects not only allow for students to be motivated and creative, but it can also be beneficial and guide them towards a career path. Although some may say that students will choose something simple and will not learn important content because of the freedom given to them, I do not agree because people learn through every day experiences and are more likely to put more thought into their research instead of putting in minimum effort in something they are not interested in. Giving students the freedom of doing what they choose is beneficial and everyone should be allowed to research what they are interested in because it is beneficial and fulfilling at the end for the student and teachers. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
29192A5DEFD5,"Summer is mostly a time for kids to relax and wind down from the stress that school causes. Summer projects can seem like a burden but in reality they are very beneficial. Nevertheless summer projects should be given out to insure that kids dont fall behind when they go back to school in the fall and so that the transition from summer to school is much easier for the kids and teachers. Summer projects should be teacher-designed for the reasons that they know what will be thought in the upcoming year and they will also challenge kids to do their best work.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed due to them knowing what the curriculum demands them to teach. Kids have minimal to no idea of what they will learn in the upcoming year but teachers on the other hand are given an overview of what the kids should learn throughout the school year. So it seams very foolish to let a kid make up their own project without them knowing what is expected of them. A kid can not magically know what they need to do their project on. They might be able to design the project but in reality they could just be wasting their time doing a project that has nothing to do with what they will learn in the upcoming year. It is not beneficiary for the kids to work on a project that has nothing to do with what they will learn in school. It also dose not benefit the teacher considering that the kids will walk into class not knowing a thing. The teacher will have to wast time introducing the subjects, where if the teacher would have designed the project that would not be needed.

Another reason why summer projects should be designed by teachers is due to the fact that they will challenge their kids in doing the best work possible. Teachers wont cut corners when it comes to teaching and informing the future of this world because thats their passion. Teachers know how important it is that kids constantly practice and or learn new things throughout the summer. If they dont it is very likely that the kids will not retain all the information they learned from the perverse school year. That could cause a slow start to the year due to the teacher having to refresh the kids on some subjects. Teachers wont create summer projects that only take a couple of minutes to complete, but instead give projects that will have the kids doing the project in little sections throughout the summer. This would result in the kids coming up with a system which would not only help them prioritize their time but also have them consistently doing school work.

While some may say that summer projects should be student-designed, that is not the case. If kids where able to design there own summer projects it would be highly unlikely that they would make something that challenges them. Kids are not focused on spending there time creating a challenging project for school; on the contrary, kids just want to have the best possible summer. There would be no structure whatsoever leaving the kids to make all the decision. They would chose easy topics that would only take a couple of minutes to complete. Due to that they would be self compromising their opportunity to really show what kind of good work they can truly do.

It seems very clear that summer projects should not be student-designed but teacher-designed. Teachers know exactly what the kids should practice and learn during the summer so that they are prepared to have a smooth transition for playing outside with their friends to learning in the classroom. It would also prevent kids from taking the easy way out and designing a project that would take a couple of minute to complete. On top of that they would also be hurting the teacher, classmates, and themselves in the fact that they wont be prepared when school starts. This causes a chain of affects that in the end helps no one but hurts everyone. Summer should be a time to relax and have fun but kids should always have school in the back of there heads. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9C95376E8F12,"If it is Summer break for a student and teachers assign them projects to do over that time, would it be easier and/or more efficient for the student to design their own project or, for the teachers to design it for them ?

Here's why teachers designing the projects for the student makes more sense.

Firstly,due to the fact that if the students are given a teacher designed project they'll most likely have more of an outline of instruction or better direction in which to take it, otherwise the students may not know what to do at all and come up with nothing, The student, if given the chance to design their own may make it too easy for themselves and ultimately learn nothing new over break, Finally the teacher has the opportunity to make something they know the student will be able to understand and manage (as long as they know the student well enough).

Going into more detail with each of these examples now; if the teacher doesn't design a project for the student they may become overwhelmed or confused as stated previously, they could easily lose track of what they're doing because the stress of school holds little weight over them because it is summer and they don't feel the urge to take it as seriously.

However if the teacher does this and makes clear, understandable instructions on what to do and how to do it, the student may feel less overwhelmed or lost, and end up getting it done in a reasonable amount of time and with a good grade as well.

Additionally, if the students make it, they could very well make it TOO easy for themselves without prior outlining of what to do, such as a poster or something of that caliber. All the student needs to do to get it finished is slap a couple pictures on it and write down minimal information about whatever they may be creating that project for. If students were to take such an easy route, the chances of them retaining that information is extremely low.

Finally, the final in depth example on why teachers should make summer projects for their students if their school participates in this rule, Teachers are more than likely reachable over the course of the Summer if the students are still confused as to what they're doing thus making the help of a teacher via email available.

This all isn't to say that there aren't any perks to the students designing these themselves (assuming the student is responsible);

An argument could be brought on to some of these examples saying, maybe if the student doesn't like the project the teacher has created for them, the student could become bored and uninterested, leaving them with a creativity block, that just makes them want to go and do things that their Summer break is for. As well as The student may work more diligently and productively in general if they have creative freedom to do what they want, or can imagine going well with their projects. Third and finally, if the student has no creative freedom they could unintentionally spend more of their break doing something was given to them to do than they had initially thought.

Though there are valid examples for either side to choose from, the side in favor of teachers designing said projects, overall out weighs the other. The percentage of students who can work well from a standard academic point, to the percentage of students who work better at their own pace and creativity level is unequal but, Students with standard learning skills greatly out number the creative working students on average, in most places at least.

Again, teachers provide more help to a greater number of students, They create an outline of instruction, and they keep most students from cheating and making things too easy for themselves.

In conclusion either side could potentially be chosen to argue from but, the question still stands, Would it be easier for teachers or students to create these projects ?",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
5C094CEAB69B,"Many schools assign summer projects as a way to ensure that students continue learning throughout summer break. It would be more beneficial if these summer projects were student-designed as opposed to teacher-designed because students would be allowed more creative freedoms with their projects, individualized learning, and students would be more apt to starting and completing their projects. While teacher-designed projects are easier to create, they leave students unmotivated and bored, but learning shouldn't be boring.

Teacher created projects are boring; with student-designed projects, students can be as creative as they want with their learning. When students are allowed to create their own projects, they are able to have more fun with what they are doing and in turn, are able to enjoy learning. While having complete freedom of how they may design their projects, students might have a difficult time; this is why there must be some structure and guidelines to lead students along the right path in their learning. Creativity is very important when it comes to learning because students won't remember things that they were bored learning, but when teachers find ways to make learning fun it is easier to retain information. Many students at Generic_School are given projects that allow students to go about their project in many different ways that appeal to them and their learning style. Often times projects are immediately related to PowerPoint or posters, but now medias such as Prezi, video, games, etc. are available to students, projects incorporating different medias are more fun to complete, allowing students to learn easier. When it comes to summer, students don't want to be bored, so allowing them to create their own projects in fun, creative ways makes them more excited to do their projects.

Every student is different and so is the way that they learn. Some students have no problem cranking out teacher-designed projects, but others do not find them so easy to complete. Allowing student-designed projects allow for more individualized learning. These projects would allow students to learn and review what they need to in order to be successful. While a broad and general review is good, sometimes students need extra love in certain areas of content. Giving students the freedom to come up with ways to learn what they need to is important to ensure that content is locked down and that students are on the same level. Many high schools across the country give out summer assignments, but they're not the best, at Generic_School students are given summer assignments but the assignments are only a general review or unnecessary work, they don't teach and leave students confused, but most importantly they don't allow students to heavily review confusing topics which can lead to students being left behind in their learning before the new school year even begins. There are just too many students with different learning needs that cannot be satisfied by teacher-designed projects. When students are given the ability to help themselves and learn what they need to how they need to, they will be more successful in their learning.

Students knowing that they are able to learn what they want, how they want makes them more motivated to do their work. When work is fun and exciting, it is much easier to complete and to want to complete. Teens and kids are so used to the same type of learning and the same projects that they have been asked to complete their whole lives that it is boring and extremely hard to find the motivation to do something they are bored with, they just don't want to do it. However, when students are given the ability to learn how they want to, it is exciting, especially when students are passionate about what they are doing. Not only will students be more motivated to do their summer projects, but student-designed projects would also lead to less academic dishonesty. At Generic_School, summer assignments have been the exact same thing for all students and they haven't changed in years, this means that it is extremely easy to find and/or get the answers to the summer assignments. This being said, it would be a lie to say that students don't cheat, because they do, but with student-designed projects, each project would be more individualized to each students needs, eliminating the ability to cheat. It just makes more sense to allow students to learn what they need to, how they want and need to, it gives them the ability to catch up to where their peers are, on their own time and terms.

It is time to revolutionize learning, and the first step is to let students take control of their own learning. Teacher-designed projects just aren't cutting it anymore, it is time for a change. Students need to be given the opportunity to work hard to get to where they not only need to be academically, but also were they want to be. No more students left behind in the dust of their classmates when they don't grasp the content of their course. Student-designed projects could be the end of cheating but also the beginning of a new way of learning where creativity is embraced. Student-designed projects could make students more motivated to do well because they don't feel stuck and confused. Every now and then, we need to allow students to take charge of their own learning, with their teachers as a guide on their path to success and understanding. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
E4EDEE977D32,"During the summer some schools require summer projects for the students to do over summer break. The schools give out these projects to ensure that the students are still learning during the summer. The goal of these projects was to ensure that when the students get back from summer break they would have remembered lessons from last school year or that they have learned something new. These projects can be teacher-designed or student-designed, allowing these projects to be student-designed can allow the students to showcase the skills and lessons they have learned during summer break. With these projects being student-designed they can also show the creativity of a student. However, if the projects were to be teacher-designed it could cause more stress on the students that they do not need to deal with during the summer.

When summer break starts all the students can think about is how they get to hang out with friends or relax during summer they do not think about school at all because school is finally out and they do not have to do anymore homework. Giving out projects for them to do during the summer can be stressful because it could be a very hard subject for the student to focus on. Having to come up with multiple projects over the summer can be overwhelming to the students because not every student has the resources to complete certain projects. If the projects were to be designed by the teachers it could make the students stress more about it because the student might not know a lot of information about that topic since they might not remember a lot about that subject. The projects could be on a topic that the student might not know about which would require them to put more work and effort into the projects which could result in less time to relax.

Learning new things for students can be exciting for them when it comes to learning something new in away that does not take the fun away. With these projects being student-designed the student would have more fun learning about the subject that they choose to do because the subject would have been in an area that they might know a lot about or the subject could have been in an area that the student was very interested in learning about. Having the students choose the topic of their project is better than having a teacher choose because the student could have been very curious about a certain topic that the teacher has never taught so they were not able to learn about it in school. Learning in school is limited to certain topics, which could not satisfy the students that want to learn something new that they have never heard about. Schools can limit a students area of topic because there are some topics that might not be available for the students to take during school so they have to learn about it outside of school which can be frustrating for them because not everything they find on the internet is true so they would not know if what they were learning was actual facts or not.

Some people might say that the summer projects should be teacher-designed because then the students would not have to rush at the end of summer to get all of these projects done or that they would not have to worry about coming up with projects to do during the summer. However, having these projects be student-designed can show the creativity of a student. Students are more likely to do summer projects if they are able to be created by themselves because it allows them to express their selves and get a grade for it. Showing creativity for a student can be very important when it comes to creating projects because they want to show that they have actually put time and effort into the projects and that they did not just throw them together last minute. Putting in time and effort into school projects can give the students a lot of confidence because the student knows that they have fully researched the subject and that when they make the projects they know that they will get a good grade. It can also allow the students to be more open minded when coming up with these projects because the projects have to show what they have learned over the summer whether it is something new or something that they already know.

Making students do projects over the summer is a good idea because it allows them to keep learning however, the projects should be student-designed because students are not always going to do a project that is designed by a teacher since they know that the topic could be boring or not interest them at all. Having students come up with their own projects is beneficial for them because they are the ones in control of what they have to learn about and they are the ones that have to be able to come up with their project topics. Being able to showcase the creativity of the student and what they have learned is very important to them because it can give them confidence when they are putting together their projects. Since it allows them to show the skills that they have learned over the summer in order to complete the projects students would be more satisfied with the outcome of the projects and the grades that they get. These project will also allow students to show what type of things they are interested in learning about which could help the teachers get a better understanding of their students and what they want to learn about.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
17643FC4CA90,"The worst feeling for a teacher is when their new class for the year walks in, and they barely even know what class they signed up for. Teacher designed summer projects provide students with an introduction to the the new material they will be learning for the year, and create a basis for the teacher to start off of during the beginning of the course. These projects assure that all students are on the same level, heavily reducing the work and stress put onto the teacher.

Most students nowadays will always look for the quickest and easiest way out. This leads to skipping over crucial learning aspects that are required thought the year. Furthermore, student designed summer projects wouldn't be nearly as effective as teacher created, due to how the students may be unaware of what they will be learning in the upcoming year. The students simply would not be able to create such a project that would be nearly as beneficial as a teacher created one. This concept can be show through diagnostic tests that students are prompted to take at the beginning of many courses. When tested on material about the class, the majority of students aren't even returned with a passing grade. The point of these tests are to show the improvement students make thought the year, and allow teacher to better understand what aspects of the class they need to go more in depth into. All being considered, students with a fresh mindset in any given class would not be able to create an effective summer project that would provide a strong lead way into the year.

All teachers have a certain amount of material they are supposed to cover thought the year, while in many cases they are given plenty of time to cover each topic of their course, time can becomes limited due to the extensive amount of time taken up at the begging of the year catching everybody up to speed on the basic foundations of the course. This can be greatly reduced if the summer projects that students are given, were designed by the teachers themselves. This allows the teachers to make sure everybody is on the same page at the beginning of the year, allowing a smooth transition into new content, and not wasting time on relearning the basics. This problem is present in many classes at the beginning of the year. An extensive amount of time is spent answering basic questions as to what the course is about, content from previous years, and basic fundamentals of the class that students should already know. All of these can be avoided by a well organized teacher created summer project because they know the course better than anyone else. Allowing teachers to create such a project would ensure both themselves, and the students are confident starting off the new year, and ready to learn.

Many students argue that student created summer projects would allow them to learn better because they will be able to pace themselves better. Many of people, including teachers, have found this to be true. Student created projects would ultimately allow them to create a fun project environment were they get to express their creative side, constructing a project that is both entertaining, and not as overwhelming as many teacher created projects, yet still covering material about the given course. This method, while at first glance may seem more effective, will not provide students with sufficient education and preparation that the teacher will have prepared for the year. By allowing teachers to create their own summer project for the students, it enables them to make sure all students are both prepared, and caught up with previous material that will set course for the challenging year ahead of them. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
43A603645B8A,"Summer projects should be student designed because honestly what student wants to do their work over the summer. Student designed projects may include what they did over their break or what they wish they did over break, some students will most likely forget about it anyway because its summer and some people have to work also. i believe it would be more interesting for a student designed projects because it would most likely be, again, what they did over the summer.

students, indeed yes need their education and they need to learn, that is why if a teacher just hands them a project and say here you have to have this complete before you come back after summer break. that will knock the interest level down a lot for students. when its summer break i love to go off and have fun with my friends and family, we always are out doing something weather it be hanging around the house or off on a trip somewhere, other students dont do this and it is honestly really cool, last summer my girlfriend and i went down to nags head with her family, i had the most fun time while we were down there, even though i accidentally left my wallet at her house.

Students learn best when they are on their own and/or out doing something, the teachers already know what to do about a teacher designed project and that i do believe is why some students dont get along with the teacher. Teachers want to help kids and kids that have troubles listening or learning, i'm not saying that teachers dont listen because you have some of them that do, but, unfortunately teachers dont interact with students as they should so a student designed project would make it a lot more entertaining and interesting for the teacher because it allows the teacher to sit back and read about who that kid is, what that kid likes, and how that kid acts, it shows a lot of that and it is really helpful for the teacher to actually understand the student that is doing the project and know how his or her lifestyle is, i agree, students should come up with a student designed project over the summer.",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
B2E594733164,"In school, summer assignments are a fundamental part of any advanced-level class. They help students have a background on the information they will learn the following school year. Even if they are a necessity, it cannot be guaranteed that every student will complete it. Or rather, that the students who do complete it, may not take in the information needed and be able to possess a greater understanding of the knowledge during the first few weeks of school. That is why it would be a wise decision to begin a tradition of student-created summer assignments as opposed to teacher-created ones. It would be beneficial since students will become more motivated to complete it because it is modeled after what they would prefer to do, students will need to make themselves more invested in the assignment since, they are selecting what information they will be focused on learning, and the design aspect of creating the assignment is also an important skill being utilized.

Firstly, student-created summer assignments would be better, because students will become more motivated to complete the assignment because it is modeled after what they would prefer to do. For example, a similar situation to this has happened a few months back, my friend Generic_Name had begun going to the gym. At first, he began doing workouts that were recommended by peers, but he didn't really enjoy them, which made exercise and going to the gym feel tedious. Though as weeks passed, he began to learn which exercises he enjoyed and began making workout plans that used them. Now, he is as fit as he's ever been and really likes visiting the gym and working out. This is relevant, because the students who create the assignments will be like Generic_Name, they will pick what makes a task more enjoyable and and put it into their summer assignments. Even if some might say that not all students would be motivated to complete the assignment, even if they enjoy what is in it. It will still be true that more students will at least complete it, compared to a teacher-designed assignment.

Secondly, a student-designed summer assignment would be more beneficial because, students would need to make themselves more invested in the assignment since they are selecting what information they will be focused on learning. A personal example of this, was when I was in art class in middle school and I was given a project to do research on any topic related to art I could want. This was great, because I was now more motivated to research. I studied graphic design pre-computers, a topic I have always been extremely interested in. I ended up learning so much about it and I never really lost interest throughout the project, and in the end I earned in A for my presentation. This relates to how a student would be invested into their summer assignment, because as in my example, I chose a topic I enjoyed and became extremely invested. I was only invested because I got to choose, and that topic I selected was something of interest to me. Although, not all students may be invested in their work, it would be safe to assume many will, since they had a choice on what they get to learn.

Lastly, student-created summer assignments are better, because the design aspect of creating the assignment is also an important skill being utilized. Probably the best part about students creating their summer assignments is that the students will also be learning design aspects depending on what they're creating. Not only are students learning from their summer assignments, but they are also taking in information on how to make good study-tools and study-tools that look aesthetically pleasing as well. Assuming that the students will take away from these experiences, I could see how it can add to the quality of their class lives. Especially because they have better tools at their disposal to use. However, some people may say that design is not an important aspect. I would have to disagree because there is no downside to learning a new skill, especially one as helpful as design.

It should now be felt as if student-designed summer assignments are the best choice as opposed to a teacher-designed one. Students in school should feel like they are in control of their work and that they can use critical thinking to complete work, and them creating their own summer assignments is one of the things they can do. Students need some individuality and the creation of their own summer assignment can really show their understanding on a subject. As a matter of fact, it would be great if schools could test the waters with this idea. In conclusion, students creating their summer assignments is a smart choice, due to benefits such as motivation because of interest in a project, how that interest can make a student more invested in the information, and how important skills, like design, are learned along the way.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
D7EB67A94A1E,"Let's face it, summer assignments are the biggest waste of time possible. Even more of a waste than the SOL. Who wants their summer having to be cut into, all because of a bunch of assignments at a teacher's request? That just isn't right, nor how it should be. While summer assignments are a pain, wouldn't they be less painful if the student had input on the assignment, or even designed it themselves? Summer assignments should be student-designed because it allows for more individuality, the ability to learn at one's own pace, and allows the student more time to enjoy the summer, and complete the assignment.

To begin, individuality allows a student to be more creative. Teacher guidelines require students to complete the assignment, but in their way. Which is not only much more difficult and time consuming, but is not enjoyable in any way. Schools are a place that are supposed to promote creativity, with teachers being the most vocal about those practices. But when there are so many guidelines, and a student cannot do a project their way, what is really being promoted? When a student is given even a small bit of control, the student is much more intuitive. This is not only displayed by the demeanor of a student, but the grade as well. Students perform much better when they are feeling well. With individuality, the motivation of a student is greatly improved. With the many activities that go on during the summer, such as jobs, hanging out with friends, etc. Many students lack the motivation to complete schoolwork, especially with deadlines and more work being assigned with time, students lack the will to even want to do work. Creative control can greatly change that, and provide students with a greater motivation to complete their assignments. It's simple, if a student can choose their own assignment, make their own deadline, and have full creative control over the work they put in, students will be much more likely to enjoy and complete their assignment. At the end of the day, a summer assignment is what it is, and no one wants to do it, but if one can enjoy it even in the slightest, there is a greater chance it will be completed with a positive outcome.

In addition, students should be able to learn at their own desired pace. Many teacher-designed summer assignments have specific deadlines and requirements, that not only add stress to the student, but affect the student's overall mental health and performance. Many studies have shown that assigned deadlines drastically increase anxiety in a student, which not only affects mental capabilities, but harm the performance abilities, leading the student to do worse in that assignment. This is important because if a student is not in the correct state of mind, it will be displayed in the school work and be reflected by the low grade that student will receive. Also, mental health should always be valued over school work, and if schoolwork is causing mental health to drop, then action should be taken. Going off that point, working off one's own pace greatly relieves stress. Like stated before, deadlines cause a great deal of anxiety, however anxiety does not stand alone. Adding deadlines and constant assignments adds an abundance of stress. With heavy deadlines, while still trying to meet the given criteria, a student will feel overwhelmed and consumed with schoolwork. That feeling is neither healthy, nor ethical for any student, let alone it being during the summer. No student under any circumstance should be stressed or have any anxiety attack during the summer, all because of schoolwork.

Lastly, student-designed summer assignments allow students to be able to enjoy their summer. Everyone loves the summer, but despises the school year. The summer is meant to be a break period, a time of relaxation, vacation, and so much more. However, not many can shake the thought that always lingers in the back of their mind. Even with all this free time, there's still an entire report that needs to be typed, or book to be read, or whatever the case may be. One could be having the time of their life, but when that thought comes, everything goes down, and suddenly the mood has been changed. With student-designed assignments, this feeling won't be eliminated, but much more tolerable and controlled. A student will be able to enjoy doing the assignment, as they created it, while leaving extra time for other summer activities. This is important because not only is the student much more content, but they also have much better time management. To add, students being able to design assignments allows for free time. Many students have jobs during the summer, and without school being in the summer, hours can vary. Assignments designed by teachers are not friendly, nor beneficial to a student's personal schedule. This is another reason why student-designed assignments are so beneficial. Students could design a schedule that is flexible to their own, which leaves time for school, work, and other summer plans.

Student-designed summer assignments grant students free will and individuality, their own learning pace, and an enjoyable summer. The more individuality a student is granted, the more creativity that is brought to a project. A student being able to learn at their own pace is greatly backed by many studies, and can ease the stress level of the student. Every student deserves a nice summer after a long, grueling school year full of late nights and early mornings. Teacher-designed summer assignments don't grant any of these privileges, but only hinder them. Students should be able to set their own guidelines, while being able to relax, go on trips, play their sports, and so on without a teacher standing in the way. That is the definition of summer break.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
0CA02601D5C5,"Summer break has always been the best time of the year for students. They don't have to go to school, they get to do outdoor activities, and they get to see their friends. Recently, schools have introduced summer assignments to help students maintain their learning abilities over the break. The biggest debate on this issue is whether or not the projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. If the students are able to design these projects, they will still be able to have a great, fun-filled break. Students should design their own summer projects because summer vacation should be enjoyable, it will teach them organizational skills, and it will help them become more independent.

Summer break should be enjoyable for students. Giving them the opportunity to design their own summer projects allows them to do accomplish goals for academics and knowledge while doing something they enjoy. They can use their creative freedom to make their project about a topic or activity that they are interested in. When I was eleven, we had to come up with our own projects for the fifth grade science fair. They gave us the choice to make our project about whatever we wanted. I designed my science project about bacon, because I loved to eat bacon. It made the assignment more fun and easier to complete. Allowing other students to create this sort of project centered around something they love will give them a more enjoyable process and satisfaction upon completion. Letting students design and form their own summer projects will give them a fun, entertaining break while giving them the purpose of learning and getting better.

These student designed projects will give students the opportunity to practice their organizational skills. Many students struggle with the ability to organize themselves and accomplish goals efficiently. My brother doesn't know where his assignments are half the time. It is hard for him to organize himself and get things done. The student-designed summer assignments give a perfect opportunity for students to learn and teach themselves how to make sure they do everything in a timely matter. The summer break gives them enough time to come up with a schedule and get things done without worrying too much about close deadlines and other impeding assignments. Letting students create the goals and structure for they're summer projects will help teach them to be more organized.

Student-designed projects will teach them to become more independent. Many students struggle with thinking and acting independently. The memorize information for class and regurgitate it back up on a testing sheet. They blindly follow what their teachers say and don't know how to function without close help. If the students make their own projects, they will need to figure out how to complete the work themselves, without help from their teachers. They will likely need to come up with a detailed schedule to plan out when the will do every part of the task assigned. If they don't stick to the plan they've drawn out themselves, they will fail the assignment. In addition, it teaches students valuable skills for their post-graduation life. In the real world, there is no teacher or instructor to help you accomplish the tasks needed to have a successful life. When students become adults they will need to know how to make decisions for themselves. They will need to be able to act responsibly without somebody telling them when or how to do it. If students are able to design their own summer assignments, they will become more responsible and independent.

Student-designed projects will make students more independent, give them a chance to become more organized, and help them to enjoy their summer. It is good for students to learn how to operate without a helping hand over their shoulder. Working own their own projects will teach them to become better at time management. Also, students should not dread doing their work over the summer. Summer assignments designed by students help them to become better learners and better people. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
A0E3127D3E13,"Some schools make kids do summer projects to assure they continue to learn on their break. In my opinion, I think that the projects should be student-designed. I think that because some teachers might be to hard on their students and make them do to much work. For example, teachers might make the projects to long and not give students enough time to enjoy their breaks. Another reason why I think the projects should be student-designed is because the sutdents can choose a topic they enjoy and not have to do a project based on somehting they dislike for the whole summer. I also think it'd be a good idea for the projects to be student-designed is because the student can time him or herself and complete the project in time for the next school year and not fail.

If the summer projects are teacher-designed, the teacher could take advantage and make their students do way to much for their break. If the students end up having to do to much work over their break then whats the point of even taking a break? Students will end up hating their summer breaks when in reality the summer break is supposed to be the best time of the year to enjoy the outdoors and do all kinds of fun stuff. They wouldn't have to use up to much time focusing on their project and have time to spend it with friends and family. What if that sttudent had already made plans to go on a family trip and come back with no time to do the summer project because it was to long?

Imagine having to do a school project that takes up the whole summer that is based on something a teacher would enjoy doing. If the school projects were student-designed they could make a project based on what they like doing. It's bad enough they have to do a school project over the summer but they can at least enjoy doing the project if it was student-designed. For example, if I were to make a school project it would most likely be about science because it envolves fun science expierements that could be done outside in nice weather. Doing a project that was designed by me would mean that I could do fun stuff and learn at the same time that way I could enjoy my summer and get a good grade with no problem.

If the summer project was student-designed they can plan out the project and make time for it so they can turn in the project fully complete. For example, they can make trips with friends and family and plan out what they need to do for their projects and how much time they would have left to do fun stuff. If the project was designed by a teacher they wouldn't know what to expect and would have to cancel on some trips they had alrady made just for a school project but, if the project was designed by a student then they could possibly include their friends and family into the project and everyone could have fun and enjoy summer. The students wouldn't have to worry as much about the project grade because they would have already done it and complete by the time the next school year comes around.

In conclusion, the best choice would be to make the school projects student-designed. everything would be just right for that student and can assure teachers that most of them would complete the school projects. With the project being not to much work they can enjoy their summer. if the project were to be about a subject the student likes they would have fun and learn at the same time during the summer. The students would have a huge advantage if they could plan everything out and have good time for the project if it was student-designed. At the end of the day, both teachers and students would be happy with the project being complete and students being able to enjoy their summer time outdoors with friends and family. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
BC40D61679A5,"When summer comes around, students stop worrying about school and go out to do their own thing. This often leads to students forgetting everything that they had learned the year prior. In order to stop this from happening, it is best to give the students an assignment over break. This gives the students something to keep their brains going and get them prepared for their class next year. It is more beneficial for the teachers to make an assignment for the students. They can assign what the students need to specifically learn, use a rubric so it could be easier for the students to do it and the teacher to grade, and set a challenge for the students to accomplish.

There are many concepts that you could learn in a specific subject; giving students the ability to choose any would not be very helpful. The students could pick a concept that do not matter as much as others, or they could pick the one they find the easiest so they would not have to try as hard as they should. The teacher, however, knows what the class is like and what their past students had a hard time on, so they can assign the next students something that would help them understand the concept before they start the class. Since most students do their summer assignments closer to the end of their break, they would most likely remember it when the concept comes later on in the year. They could also keep the assignment so they could use it to study later on. If the teacher knows which concept to use, then they could requirements for the students to reach.

With a concept chosen for the students, teachers can set guidelines and a rubric for them. The rubric can show the specific points that the students need to reach to make sure that they are doing what they are suppose to be doing. It could also help them understand what they have to do so they are not left in the dark. With the rubric, students would know when it is a good time to stop. This would stop them from doing too much unnecessary work. For example, I was given a rubric for an English essay. I was able to use the rubric to understand what I had to exactly do in the essay. If i was not given the rubric, I could have done the assignment completely wrong and not the way the teacher wants it. I could see what the teacher wanted from me, so I did not have to guess what she wanted and stopped before I was doing too much. This also helped her grade other essays since she can just go down the rubric and see if they completed the requirements. The set requirements could also set a difficulty for the students.

The activities that students participate in during the summer often do not require much thought. They had just completed several months of studying, doing homework, and going through tests. They would not be studying for a class that they are not in yet. This leads to them not thinking as much as they should, so the teacher could give them something that could be challenging for them to keep their brains going. The student could easily cut corners so they would not have to try, but the teacher can set a challenge for them to make sure they are well prepared for the class. Since the students will most likely procrastinate right before school begins, it could be used as a warm up for the class. With the set challenge, the students would be able to know what the class is like and if they should switch out or stay in before school begins.

Students can be lazy at times, so the teacher giving them something to do is far more helpful. Since they are still young, the students might not try to push themselves as much as they should. The teacher knows what is in the class and give the students something that would be helpful for them. The requirements that the teachers set would help the students know what they should be doing and wasting time on useless things. A challenge can also help keep their brains going and understand what they are getting themselves into if they do the class. Students often do not know what is best for them, so teachers need to help get them where they need to be and push them more if they believe that the student can handle it. The teachers, most of the time, knows what is best for their students to succeed.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8

Generic_Name 3/5/20

During the summer its our time to have fun and relax. During the summer we are allowed to hang out with friends, grow up, travel around the country and even the world in some cases. If you are going to design a project it should be student designed with an acception of a student/ teacher collab. The reason it should be student designed is to allow the students to make it fun for themselves and so they enjoy it. It makes since especially since the summer is our time to have fun. A few examples of cool, easy, and fun projects would be, to make a power point for example, but on this power point your gonna put pictures you've taken of places that you had visited this summer. You could also, do a story, you'd write about what you did this summer and you could have a paragraph for each week.

The summer is a hard time to do projects and to work on things. During the summer some kids travel, have jobs, or have plans to hangout with friends at the pool. Kids work way longer hours in the summers than the school months, allowing them to earn more money for a car. It's the one time of year were we don't have to worry about test or homework. So during this time I think they should help decide and create a project that will be do at the end of summer allowing them to chose what would be easier on them to do during their time. Having the teacher assign you something to do during the summer may not work out for most students because they don't know what each of their students will be doing all summer.

Students and teachers can work together on making the projects. If students and teachers worked together on making projects for the summer it wold allow the students and teachers to work something out allowing the teachers to make sure the students can get it done and it will not effect the students summer. The projects don't have to be easy but the must be sure to keep time in mind since the summer is the students time. The project should also be something fun to make the student want to do it and not want to procrastinate. They should also make the project due during the first week of school allowing the kids to be able to add finishing touches by letting them ask teachers what else they may need since they may have forgotten things during their summer break.

If the teacher makes the test they should keep the student in mind. They should keep in mind that the summer is the students time to Work, Party, and travel with family. They should also, keep in mind that people want to relax and enjoy the summer and a project that's not fun and nobody looks forward to doing is not something they should assign. They should assign something that students wont procrastinate on and not want to do. Cool project examples could be like creating a travel information sheet about what you did during the summer, a cool essay about your favorite place you had visited or wish to visit next summer, you could also do something were you'd take pictures of things you did and put them into a power pint explaining your favorite parts of that.

During the summer it is the students time to have fun and to relax, during this time they should have to work on something they want to do and created for themselves. This would allow the student to want to put effort into the project and make it fun for them to do during their own time. The best way to learn is to learn about something you love and want to learn about. Making someone learn something they may not want to learn about or make someone do when they dont want to shouldnt be your choice it should be theirs. A cool project that would be fine to assign over the summer would to be Assign yourself a goal and once you reach that goal write a 5 paragraph essay on it.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
8BFAB96C9341,"Summer break is a three-month-long interruption for students from learning. Due to the lack of active educational engagement for most students during this break, many forget much of the material they learned. Therefore, schools are making use of summer projects to ensure students continuously learn throughout the year without any interruptions. Critics of the idea, mainly students, argue summer projects encroach upon the only necesary long term break students have from the ardous process of learning, and they believe that summer projects should be student-designed to further satisfy their demands. However, summer projects should be teacher-designed to assure students continue learning over break because teachers know the material better, teachers have more experience, and because students have an inherent bias.

Because teachers are very well-versed in their subjects, teacher-designed summer projects are more effective than their student-designed couterparts. For instance, compare a student-designed chemistry summer project to a chemistry teacher-designed summer project. The student's knowlege of chemistry is most likely miniscule when compared to that of the chemistry teacher's as the chemistry teacher would have years of experience in the feild as well as a college degree in chemistry. Therefore, the teacher-designed chemistry summer project will better ensure a more accurate understanding of greater range of chemistry than the student-designed counterpart. Since this same logic applies to many other educational subjects as well, teacher-designed summer projects will better achieve the goal of summer projects by assuring students continue learning during break.

Since teachers have more experience with creating projects and teaching their respective subject, teacher-designed summer projects are more proven to be effective. Teacher's experience (years of teaching) serves as a

""R and D"" (research and design) period where teachers can learn which teacher-based projects will allow for the greatest chances of student success and understanding. For example, a teacher who found that poster summer-projects almost always guarantee higher diagnostic test scores than powerpoint projects will design poster summer-projects for his or her students in the future. Therefore, the additional experience that teachers have over students in designed projects and assignments is a major reason why teacher-designed summer projects should be utilized.

Student-designed summer-projects are prone to an inherent bias because most students are critics of the idea of using summer projects. These students believe that summer projects violate the idea of having a ""break"" from school and learning. As a result, students, with such mentalties, are most likely to design weak and non-effective summer projects when compared to those designed by teachers. These weak student-designed summer projects act as a ""waste of time"" rather than a valuable extension of learning from the classroom to over break. Therefore, it is more effective to utilize teacher-designed summer projects than these weak student-designed summer projects.

Due to teachers having more experience in their respective subject and teaching and students possesing an inherent bias, teacher-designed summer projects should be favored over student-designed summer projects. Teacher designed summer projects allow for a greater understanding of the subject by students in the most efficient manner; whereas, student-designed summer projects don't guarantee to produce any meaningful results. Therefore, the schools that require students to complete summer projects during their break should utilize teacher-designed summer projects to assure students continue learning during their break. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
C3EEDCA21B42,"Warm air and salty hair, whats better than summer? Nothing! Summer is all about swimming, sleeping and hanging out at the pool with friends. However, that all ends in august, when it's back to waking up at six o'clock in the morning and all that awful hoemwork. Would'nt it be nice if there was a way students could adjust to school without physically beging there? Teachers should design summer projects to help with this very issue, because it prepares students for the upcoming cirriculum, aids students in adjusting to their teaching style and it will help students get back into the swing of school.

Going back to school after summer break isnt fun for teacher or students, nor is it easy. Having a summer project may seem dreadful, however it can actually be very benefital. As students age into their next year of school the cirriculum gets harder and harder. Having a project to help ease them into their next year of school would alliveate the anxious feelings surrounding that course. In fact, many students are taking advanced placement courses, surrounding those advanced courses is stress and anxiety, a project designed by their advanced placement teacher will help prepare them in what to expect for the year ahead.

Throughout grade school we all had a hard time adjusting to diffrent teachers as well as their teaching methods. However, if every teacher were to create a summer project to match thier teaching methods, students would be able to adjust to diffrent teaching styles which, not only would benefit the student themselves but it would also their raise their grades dramatically. Studies have shown that a student will perform better with teachers who he/she feels comfotable with, boosting their grades and overall academic perfomance.

School is hard, there is no question about it. Having the countless hours of homework, while needing to get eight hours of sleep pluse extracirruculars! Theres just not enough hours in a day! Having a project given to students would help adjust them into the swing of school by preparing them for the homework load they are about to be given. This will also prevent students from sleeping all day because they will need to do their project, and still have enough time to do what they want.

While a teacher designed summer project may be benefical, some may argue that students would do better with a student designed project because they understand the struggles of eachother and can help reduce how much work needs to be done while also teaching the student. This may help students feel less overwhellmed however it will not prepare them for the rest of their schooling years because as previously stated the course work only gets harder and simplifying the work load will not do anything.

Summer time is exciting but when it comes to a end it can be upsetting. Feeling prepared for the year to come and all the work along with it could really help one in feeling less nervous, scared, and discouraged. Teachers need to design projects over the summer so students feel excited and ready for school to begin rather than to feel disapointed and unprepared.                                  ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
C621091FAE94,"Nobody enjoys doing Summer assignments, many people believe they are pointless and a waste of time. There is a lot of controversey between student-designed projects and teacher-designed projects that has to be settled.

Although there are many ways to learn and explore, students benefit more from teacher-designed projects because they are easy to follow and start, students will learn about more relevant topics, and students gain more knowledge and explore new topics.

Teacher-designed Summer projects are very simple to follow and give everyone a starting point. There are certain guidelines that must be followed and met, which help a lot of people when they get stuck or don't know what to do. In Physics this year, I was assigned a lab in which I was to create my own lab. The lab had no guidelines or rubric; a new topic for for all of us, most everyone got stuck on the lab, since we didn't know what we were doing. The hardest part was figuring out where to start and what to do the lab on. When the labs were created by the teacher they were easy going and there were very few moments where we get stuck. Many people could be in the same scenario if students were required to create their own Summer projects; therefore, teacher-designed projects are more beneficial in this situation.

Projects designed by teachers also cause for students to be learning about more relevant topics. The teachers already know what they will be teaching, the students have an idea, but never know 100 percent. The teachers will make the students learn about things that will help them throughout the school year. For example, the Summer assignment for Chemistry, we were to memorize all of the bonds and compound formulas. These were used throughout the whole school year, and it was very necessary to know all of them. It was very obvious who didn't memorize them all before the year, and those who did succeeded more than others. Teacher-designed projects will help with the knowledge needed for the course and will benefit students throughout the year.

Teacher based projects will also enhance the knowledge of individual students who complete the assignments. The information required to learn in the Summer assignments will be used in that class, and maybe in life also. A great representation of this would be my Summer assignment for Economics. For this class we were required to research about what the economy really is and what it does. Little did I know that my idea of what the economy is was very wrong and misunderstood. I learned about how the economy as a whole works, about how the United States and world economy work together, and about what the economy does and accounts for. Without this Summer assignment I still would have learned about it in class, but digging deep into the topic caused me to open my mind about some things. I gained a lot of knowledge and learned a lot that most people don't understand about the economy. Projects created by teachers also can get people to enhance knowledge and explore new topics.

Some people might say student-designed projects are more beneficial because it allows for more flow of creativity when learning, but teacher-designed projects are more easy going for students to begin and meet expectations, students will learn about useful subjects for the class, and knowledge and wisdom will be gained while exploring new things. Often times, when students are required to create their own projects, they will get stuck on what to do the project on or have no idea where to start. With teacher based projects there are certain expectations that must be followed and things needed to be completed, causing for an easy flow, no getting stuck project. Teacher-designed projects are are more beneficial to students and their learning.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
04A7E6D80ADD,"Their is a debate whether students or teachers should choose students required summer projects. Lots of schools require graded summer projects from there students. these projects are usually given by teachers and most of the time boring and time consuming for the student to do. Summer projects should be student-designed because it gives students motivation based on intrest and it allows teachers to learn about there students from day one of school.

Schools should make summer projects student assigned for the reason that it gives students motivation because of interest. Students will have more motivation to do work during their break if the subject interest them. For example, a student who plays sports would much rather read a book about a famous athlete than a boring fictional book assigned by the English teacher. Furthermore, these changes would motivate the less motivated students with the option to choose summer projects that interest them.

Summer projects should be student-designed because it helps teachers learn about their students from day one of school. Teachers like to find what they have in common with students and this could help them relate to students. For instance, a teacher could find out basketball interest lots of students in a class, so that teacher could use basketball in there lesson plan helping students focus and understand what is being taught. Accordingly, teachers could get to know students and start to build a relationship with them through common interests.

School summer projects should be student assigned for the reason that it lets students work on and find new things that interest them and it allows teachers to learn about there students life from day one of school. Some people may say that this allows students to slack on their work and not put as much effort as they can in but if they did that it would reflect in their grade for the project. Let the students work on things they actually like. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
99D1417BDA66,"Summer projects. They are something that we all have either heard of or have experienced before in our lives. They are most-commonly despised by students, who don't even want to think of school over their nice, long summer break. However, they do offer some benefits including keeping students minds active over the break and introducing new areas of study that they may not be familiar with yet. Most summer projects do have benefits, but the fact of whether they are teacher-designed or student-designed can influence these benefits tremendously. While student-designed projects may offer a more engaging topic for students, teacher-designed projects offer many greater benefits including projects that are course based, cover more beneficial/harder topics, and allow teacher to assess a students knowledge on a subject.

The first reason summer projects should be teacher-designed is that teachers can design these projects based off of the course curriculum. Students may find these projects less engaging, but in reality they can help expose the student to what the course is going to be like/cover. All students schedule their classes for the following year sometime during the second semester of their current school year. Sometimes, students don't really have a sense of what is going to be covered in a certain class, especially if the course name doesn't do a very good job of describing what is actually going to be taught. For example, I am in my junior year of high school and just scheduled my classes for my senior year. I was debating whether to take AP Government or DE Government. By just looking off these two class names, you can't really tell what the difference is between the AP version and the DE version. With teacher-designed projects, teachers can show what is going to be taught to the students during the summer which may give them an idea of what class will be like. Overall, have summer projects be designed by teachers can help prepare students for the class they decided to take and gives a different perspective of some topics that will be covered throughout the year.

Another reason why summer projects should be designed by teachers is that the difficulty of the project can be chosen by the teachers. During summer, students really don't like to do much and rarely even think about school. They are busy relaxing and enjoying their time away from school. After all, summer is basically just a period where students get to enjoy being AWAY from school. Knowing this, why do people think student-designed projects are better/more beneficial than teacher-designed projects? I don't know about you, but if I was given the option to pick my summer project, I would most definitely not make it very hard. Do you think students want to be working on a project during their summer break? The answer to that is no. So its pretty obvious to see that when given the option of a harder topic, and an easier one, students will almost always choose the easier one. However, when students are given a project designed by the teachers, they have no choice but to complete it because it is specifically required for the class they are taking. With teacher-designed projects, teachers are able to pick a harder topic which will challenge students more and allow them to not slack off as much during the break. Overall, when teacher-designed projects help insure that a student will not pick a so called ""easy"" topic and will not slack off as much during the long period of time away from school.

The third and final reason why summer projects should be designed by teachers is because they are able to test a students level of knowledge on a given subject. If students were able to pick their own summer projects, they would most likely do something completely off topic that is very easy to them. This provides no benefit and doesn't really show the teacher their skill level. However, if the summer project is designed by the teacher, they have the ability to make it on a subject related to the course. At the end of summer, students will turn this project in to their teachers. This way teachers are able to acknowledge the level of skill a student has on a the subjects that are going to be covered in class. It also may help them change their curriculum if all students are already pretty good at a certain subject. This allows teachers to spend more time on things that students struggle with, and give them more time that would be wasted on teaching something students already know. In the end, teacher-designed project help give the teacher a better understanding of a students knowledge on a certain subject.

Overall, I believe that there are many benefits to both summer projects designed by teachers and students. However, I firmly believe that teacher-designed projects are way better and offer a lot more opportunities then student-designed projects. In the end, teacher-designed summer projects are more beneficial because the projects can be based of the course, insure students won't slack off during the summer, and help the teacher assess all students skill levels. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
B84EF55EE7F0,"Although student-designed projects isn't a horrible idea, because students would pay attention more to the assignment since their putting effort of their own into it. But at the same time student-designed project can effect them learning more,because all the assignments will be the same. It could still be a big distraction for the students.

The reason why i believe it can be bad for their learning enviorment. Since all the work will be the same the students can look things up online. Getting all the answers from the internet and being able to just cheat off friends. Students copying from friends causes students to learn less. Causes them not being envolved in the assignment. The students would be able to pick their own type of questions in the project. Those questions can be really easy for them and picj it for the less work.

For example since the students will be not learning very much during the summer. They will not be ready for the beggining of the school year. Students will find the school work difficult for them since all they did during the summer was choose easy assignments for th project and cheat off of each other. Putting in type of effort to the student-designed project.

Teacher-designed projects will be outstanding for the students. It would so get the students for envoled. The teacher can possibly let the students have partners and it'll be more exciting for them. The teacher-designed project will have work thats equal to your grade. Not make it too easy but also not too hard. Each student or group would have different kind of project so students can have their own work.

Yes student-designed projects would be cooler for the students to have their own project and not be assigned one. It can also help them learn more as much as not help them learn more because students who actually do their own work and choose good questions for the project can help them be successful. But there is just too many students who would cheat and not give effort to the project. In conclusion i think teacher-designed projects for the summer is far more successful for the students than letting them do their own designs, because of the lack of effort is going to be put in if they do student-designed project and the amount of similar project they'll be from cheating off of each other.                                 ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
FA3BDEECBD44,"School sometime's require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break,weather they should be Teacher designed or Student designed, I support having them be student designed.

The summer for students is a time to relax and enjoy time with their friends and family,to forget about school and focusing on releasing their pent up stress. Most students end up forgetting they have school project or just do them the day before school starts up again, if it the project is designed by a teacher, The teacher would be giving students a project on something they were working on in class,which the students didn't enjoy and didn't hear or focus on because they were bored. The work the teacher put in to the making and setting up the project,giving them links to get information,giving them videos,giving them easy to understand resources,finding the answer and giving them specific questions, would end up going to waste and would just be wasting the teachers time which could be spent with family and loved on. Teachers are at work most of the day which is seven to eight hours or more that they spend at work and some times end up staying late to finish grading or finish setting up for the next day or making work for students that need to catch up,by the time they get home they are to tired to spend time with their family. The students don't learn anything because its about a topic they don't even like or have no interest in. I support having the project be student designed ,Instead students will chose a topic of their choice something their interested in this way they will have to do research,find evidence,give supporting facts,find links,find videos,make an appealing presentation,learn more about their topic of choice. for example If students chose a topic they are actually interested in there's a higher chance they'll do the project because students are more willing to learn about a topic they are already interested in. another reason i support having student designed projects is not only do the students learn something new but the teacher does as well, having it be a topic most students or teachers don't know anything about helps everyone in the class learn something new or at least helps them expand their knowledge. Which results in students learning about something they enjoy,more students turning in their work,less stress for the teacher,gives students an oppurtnites to work with crowds,expands their knowledge on a topic,all the teacher would have to do is set up how the students will be graded and whats expected of them or what it should look like. Another benefit of having it be student designed is the student that spent his time learning about this topic can transfer his knowledge to his classmate who might learn something new or gain an interest or have an interest in the topic the student worked on. Having project be students designed is a simpler more efficient way of having the students learn about new topics and using the skills they learned in class to find the information and facts about the topic which takes a little stress of the searchers shoulders and gives the students something to work on if their not doing anything during the summer its an efficient way to occupies their time while helping them learn and seeing that their learning even in the summer. This is why i support having summer projects be student designed and not teacher designed their are more benefits to having a student design his own project then having a teacher waste time and put useless effort in to something they won't do.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
F0186C77BE6D,"After almost 10 months of school routines and class schedules, there looms a giant window of time between each school year where the leisure of vacations, adventures, and relaxation takes place. However, within that same time period, there is often an educational cost. A pressing concern about summer is of the fact that there lies a long period where students do not acquire new knowledge, meaning that students remain mentally static for months on end. Summer projects are often assigned by teachers in order to combat this problem, but that alone does not directly address the issue. There also comes the question of whether or not these projects should be designed by teachers or students. The best way to conduct summer projects is to make summer projects teacher-designed since teacher-designed summer projects would show students what they need to include in their project, would be easier for teachers to grade, and would allow teachers to maximize their students' education.

Conversely, others may argue that student-designed summer projects are preferable because there would be more room for creativity. For example, if students are assigned a book report and one student wants to complete the assignment in the form of a presentation instead, one may struggle to complete the assignment because he/she is not able to express his/her ideas in a way that is more comfortable to him/her. While it is true that such a scenario may occur, this can be avoided if teachers provided general standards as to what the project should include to allow for creativity. In doing so, students would be provided with both creativity and structure. Therefore, there is no need for teachers to play a secondary role in the design of summer projects.

Firstly, teacher-designed summer projects show students what needs to be included in the project, which allows students to understand what a well-done project generally consists of. For example, if a teacher assigns a science project without a rubric, students would not know if they would need to include their list of materials, how specific the procedure should be, or whether to include a short report of the results instead of a long conclusion paragraph; all of which are key aspects of the assigned project. As a result, the class's grade would be at risk because there are no guidelines given by the teacher to more specifically show what a well-conducted project would generally look like. In addition, without the rubric, the class would not know how much of their time should be dedicated to which parts of the assignment because it would not know which aspects of the project are most integral to its quality, meaning that students may end up wasting their time on a relatively insignificant part of the project. Without any form of teacher guidelines, projects would create a unnecessary source of stress for students, which is antithetical to conducive learning.

Secondly, teacher-designed summer projects would be easier for teachers to grade because there would be consistent standards that teachers are looking for when grading a project. For example, when a teacher assigns a book report with a clear rubric, the teacher knows what he/she is specifically looking for such as whether or not the student included the setting of the story, whether or not the student included the initiating event which sparked the central conflict of the story, and what that central conflict is. That way, teachers can easily give fair judgment for each assignment. As a result, the rubric saves a lot of time for teachers because instead of teachers repeatedly and meticulously looking at each essay to see if they graded each one fairly, they can simply refer to the rubric.

Therefore, without definitive teacher guidelines, projects would be extremely stressful and difficult for teachers to grade since the grade would be less likely to reflect the actual quality of the project itself.

Thirdly, teacher-designed summer projects would allow teachers to maximize their students' education because the guidelines provided would provide students with a basis of how they can best utilize their knowledge. For example, if a teacher assigns a history report on a significant historical event and the people involved, the rubric would convey which pieces of information would be most important to the project and by extension, most relevant to the event. In doing so, students would also learn many of the important aspects of said historical event such as why it happened and who caused it, which would add to their historical knowledge and demonstrate how to best learn about history. Since teachers are professional educators, their guidance is very important for students and they help instill methods that are most conducive to learning. Additionally, since summer is a two-month block in which students are separated from a school environment, rubrics remind students how to find information and how to utilize it much like school would.

To conclude, teacher-designed summer projects are more beneficial because they save both students and teachers a world of stress by serving as a guide to what projects should encompass and how projects should be graded. By serving as a guide for students, students are able to maximize their education by understanding the importance of the information they are receiving in terms of how it should be integrated into the project. By serving as a guide for teachers, teachers are able to fairly assess the quality of each project. Since such a type of project can also allow for creativity by adopting more general standards, teacher-designed projects can still be both creative and structured. Therefore, teacher-designed summer projects serve as the best continuation for students' education.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
68D68DA97502,"Imagine you're a teacher and you have to grade a project that you had no part in creating. Some schools are considering allowing students to design their own summer assignments. This would be counter-productive because, if students were allowed to design their own summer projects they would make the projects entirely too easy. When teachers design the summer assignment they can make sure that it follows the curriculum. It is also easier for teachers to grade assignments that they designed.

Some people believe that, allowing students to create their own assignments would increase the number of students who complete summer assignments. However, many students would create a project that would not teach them anything, and be a waste of time. More students would turn in assignments at the beginning of the school year, but the quality of many assignments would be very poor. What would happen is, students would spend all summer playing games and enjoying their break, and then the last couple days of break would be to throw together a project without putting any thought into it.

Secondly, when teachers design projects they can be sure that it follows the curriculum and provides a smooth transition from one school year to the next. If students were to design their summer assignments, without knowing the curriculum of the coming school year, the assignments would have little to no relevance to the course. This could confuse students when the subject matter of the course is completely different from the summer assignment. It is important for the summer assignments to be designed by the teachers, to ensure that they actually apply to the class that they are assigned by.

Lastly, it is easier for teachers to grade projects that they created. The beginning of the school year is a busy, and stressful, time for everyone. Teachers do not need the extra stress of having to grade dozens of projects that are all designed differently. It is much easier for teachers to grade the dozens of projects when all of the projects follow the same basic guidelines. When projects are designed by the teachers who will grade them it greatly reduces the stress on the teachers in the, already hectic, beginning of the school year.

In conclusion, summer assignments should be designed by teachers, so that they can be sure that the assignments are an appropriate difficulty, relevant to the coursework, and have the same structure. I encourage you to speak with, call, or email members of your local school board to prevent this proposed change. For the good of the students, as well as teachers.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
939B172F88F0,"Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks and successful business man says that the human mind will never fully invest into something that is not in their full interest. Summer time is a period in a kids life that they always look up to, a time to interact and have fun with your peers while getting off the long school hours. All students and even adults need time off to rejuvenate their mind, but given to much time off can effect their learning capacity causing the mind to forget skills. Which is why many students receive a project to complete over the summer. While many may believe that these projects should be directed by teachers, students enjoying what their doing, the feel of it not being a school related assignment like homework, and being able to choose something they may desire to pursue later on in life, shows that giving a self-designed project is more beneficial for the summer time.

Success and enjoyment go hand and hand, one doesn't come without the other. In order to reach goals, having fun has to be along the way, when stressed out and tense the performance will never be at or even near its maximum potential. When having resentment while doing something, the human body tends to be more engaged and wanting to interact with it more often. When asking an elderly couple what has made there relationship so strong they will all say it has been healthy because the sense of resentment while with each other. When someone is engaged into what their doing the results are going to be tremendously better than trying to complete anything that bores a person. All the greats in any profession are all in love with the game and their craft. For example, the late great Kobe Bryant was so famous for his incredible work ethic, and when asked about it he always answered that it was for the love of the game. The more people that invest themselves into something they have passion for the better the results are going to be in the long run. While enjoying what your doing the possibilities are endless!

Homework is a dreadful thought for many students across the nation, and when summer time comes students are ecstatic that they will not have to complete assigned tasks, unless they do. Having teachers give out mandatory topics for a summer project doesn't give the students time to be kids and explore their mind. Just like homework students will try to do the bare minimum and slide by in til the next assignment. If given a chance to really express their mind with something that interest them, teachers may learn ways to get their mind churning during the school year, helping fire that young smart brain. The body and mind are extremely similar in many ways. Just like the body when given some time off and or even switching up daily routines like, using different muscle groups by playing different sports helps prevent burning out and keeping your body healthy. Giving students time to do something self-directed where they can come up with their own ideas helps them continue learning during break while not putting stress on themselves. Summer is supposed to be a memorable time as a child, but giving written up tasks will prevent kids from having a fun and free minded summer.

Time flies and before anyone knows it people who were just in high school are applying for real life jobs. The way I look at it is high school is the red zone in football, twenty yards away from the touchdown and having four downs to get to the ten yard line. Which now represents college another four downs to get to the end zone, the real world. It's so close but nobody acknowledges it; Why not start early, giving students a chance to choose their own project it may jump start his or her mind and help the student figure out what they may or may not want to do. Giving the students an opportunity to express their own thoughts could start them down the path of their later on career. For example, my father early on in his high school days had trouble in school. From being in the learning disabled classes many would think he would never make it in the real world. It all flipped as a teenager when he decided to do the the paper route every morning. When he first started he hated it, but he then noticed what it was teaching him about himself. He noticed that he was extremely good at communicating and making connections with others. His childhood job later influenced his place in the real world and helped him find his path. If given the chance to be free, and open up their minds students can find and pursue in something that may help them later on in life.

During summer break it's essential to keep your brain churning while also being a kid. A self-designed summer project would be a great way to give your brain a change while enjoying your time off school. Many people believe that teachers could assign the summer projects so we would know the baselines, but students will never be as engaged and not be able to explore their minds. Sit back and watch the powerful creativity of a free young mind go to work.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
4F41DBBF6462,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during break. During the summer most students forget what they learned during the previous school year from all the fun they had over the summer,so teachers give out the summer project to keep all the knowledge in their brain. The summer projects are usually teacher designed and most students dont do them strikingly because they have so many rules and arent able to show their own way of what they learned. schools should let the summer project be student designed because they will have different ways to show or express what they learned,student project should actually be done and teachers will be able to see what is store for them during the school year.

Students summer reading projects is something they do during the summer, to show what they remember from the previous school year. They are able to express their work in different forms like poster boards, art designs , power points and etc. However if the teacher designed the summer project there will be specific rules on the way the teacher wants the project to look. Students are able to make fantasy boards and put or draw about their project There are so many different ways to show what has been learned over the summer or even during the school year.

the teachers designs arent all ways fun .Most projects will look the same which makes the day they showcase exhausting from seeing the same thing over and over again.

Projects should be exciting and informative for classmates. Teachers are able to see different and new techniques they can use during class. More than half the class wouldnt participate with the project if the teachers would've designed the project. Teachers can put some input to help the students design the project but not a lot to where it seems like the teachers is taking over their project. Students also wouldnt have done it because summer is there break away from all school work and teachers. For example my sophomore year of high school we had to do a summer project but it was call ""summer reading project"" it was mainly for English and it was really boring and overwhelming. There was a list that you had go choose a book from , graph organizers we had to do; and even questions we had to fill out . It was like three pages long and the books was long. Spent most of my summer reading the book barley was able to go anywhere with my friends nor family. The summer reading project wasnt even fun ,when it was time for me to do it i always got upset because i knew i was about to be bored and lonely. Students design would make the projects fun and not overwhelming.

In result of a student not doing their project would be the teacher not being able to see what they remember or know from last school year. The student is also getting a bad grade from not doing the assignment. Teachers are able to see the way the students learn. They are able to see how students will handle projects that will be assigned during the school year. there showcase on the first day of school should be informative for the classmates and teachers. Everyone should be able to show what they learned and their talent at the same time. Students want class to have more Estaing like the summer but not as much. Students dont want no boring projects over the summer where they are suppose to be having fun and out of school. Teachers should take that in to reality to because they want to have fun over the summer too.

Teachers give out the summer project to keep all the knowledge in their students brain. Summer is fun so, why not let the project be fun for the students. Students should be able to connect and relate to there project and not be bored and not wanting to do it . Schools should let the summer project be student designed because they will have different ways to show what they learned , students project will actually be done , and teachers will be able to see whats in store for them during the school year. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
DF76BBCD85B1,"There is an argument going around on whether summer projects should be designed by students or teachers.

The summer projects should be designed by the teachers because students won't challenge themselves in the summer, teachers know what criteria the students should learn, and it is the teachers job to give the students work.

The topic on this discussion is very interesting, but we all know that its would be most beneficial for the teachers to design the summer project.

To start off; if students designed their own summer project they would make it easy.

Most students can't wait for the last day of school so they don't have to do any work or should I say ""learn"".

Also if they do a summer project it should help preview what they are going to be learning in the upcoming school year, so if they don't know exactly what it is that they will be learning why should they have to design their own project which most would not what to do in the first place.

In addition to the students designing their own project there are a lot of potential problems that could occur.

Like they forget to inform everyone else on what the project is.

The students just are not mature or responsible enough to be able to design such a hefty task like a summer project all on their own.

Secondly on why teacher should deign the summer projects, is the fact that they know what they will teacher in the following school year.

The students should begin to get informed or a little bit of knowledge on what they will be taught in the upcoming school year.

The teachers that design the summer project should make it about topics that they will later teach the students on.

For example, if there is a lesson on the cells in a plant for next year, maybe have the students create a plant cell out of recycled materials.

Just little things so they come into the classroom ready and already with some knowledge on what will be presented in the school year.

Lastly on why teachers should design the summer project is that its the teachers job to design such things.

A student should not have to worry about what they are going to do for a project.

That is too much pressure on the youth.

Instead maybe teachers collectively as a group come up with multiple project ideas for the students.

Give the students multiple options on what assignment or project they would want to do.

The teacher are getting paid to teach and come up with lesson plans.

Therefore it should not be the students task to come up with any projects specifically one like a summer project.

On the other hand, if students design their own projects that could help them mature.

Although it may just apply pressure and stress on the students which is what we don't want happening to them.

We shouldn't make kids design their own projects especially if most don't want to do it.

Teachers should be the ones designing the projects due to the fact that they get paid to create such things as projects and know what lessons are going to be taught in the following year, and students just aren't ready for this type of task.

The answer is rather clear that is should be the teachers designing the projects and not the students.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
3296EAE222D9,"The world we live in is a crazy, stressful place! We should always take a step back and think about the times when we were in kindergarten and life was enjoyable because we used to tell our teachers what kind of projects and activities we would like to do in our breaks. When I was in kindergarten, me and my friends used to tell our teachers what kind of projects we would love to do. Imagine if the projects were student designed, it would make summer breaks so much better and fun. When did everyone started to make life so complicated? We should embrace the simplicity of our childhood. We were taught by our teachers and parents to do what we love for a reason. Just because they seem basic doesn't mean they will stop mattering in our lives. Although a lot of people say summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers know what's best for us and what we should learn, it is important for the projects to be student designed because student's can communicate with each other during summer breaks, they will be productive, they can focus better and be happy.

If the project's are student designed, students will be able to communicate with each other during their breaks. They would talk to each other: learn how to manage time and complete the project's and it will help them when they enter work force. By working on projects together, student's will make stronger friendships and relation's with each other. If they have projects which include communicating with each another, it will make sure they are in touch with their friend's. Some students don't call their friends which ends up losing connection with them: tasks which include communication will make sure they are in touch. Students will make good bonds and ties with their friends which is going to be really helpful when they are in need of their friends. The project's should include going to the stream or river and capturing the water and bringing it to school and testing it in the lab, as a result student's will learn time management. Student's can work with their friend's to reach a common goal. Most student's nowadays sit at home in their rooms all day long, play video games, and don't spend doing activities outdoor which is not healthy. When I have summer breaks, I just sit at home, watch videos in my home and don't step out of the house because the projects are teacher designed which are not fun. In elementary school, the projects were student designed which made life so much better. When student's enter work force, students will be working with individuals and should know how to handle situations and manage their time. That's why student's should have projects which include collaboration. This is why the project's should be student designed and include outdoor activities so that student's can go out and explore new things and stay in touch.

If the project's are student designed, student's will stay busy and productive. If they have multiple projects they love to do, they will always make out time to do it, which is going to keep them busy and make them appreciate their time and things they have. If student's are busy during their summer breaks, it will make sure that they stay out of trouble since most kid's just sit at home, waste their whole time of summer breaks, and do nothing which result's in getting them in trouble by their parent's. Parent's want their student's to be productive during breaks, student designed project's will make sure they stay busy and that they are always being productive. It will make sure student's understand work and play balance which is really important for them when they grow up and get a job. In my summer breaks, I just waste my time being on the phone and not do anything productive. If the tasks were student designed, I would love doing them. It would help me understand time management and how to be productive which is really important in our daily lives.

Student designed projects make you focus and make you happy because it's a project you love doing. It would give you less stress because you would know that it's student designed and working on it will make you happy. Students will be happy that they have some of their favorite task to do since summer break is all boring and there is nothing to do. They will know how to be responsible by doing their tasks and not waste their time. They will understand time value and how to work by themselves. Student's can get to know more about themselves, figure out who they really are, and what kind of activities they love to do. If they had a long day, coming home and realizing they have their favorite project to do would make them really happy. When I have a bad day at work, I come home and figure out I have a project to do makes me really excited about it. Working on my favorite project makes me focus better and makes me feel I know what I'm doing. This is why summer project's should be something which makes student's happy and focus better.

Some people say projects should be teacher designed because teacher's know what you should be learning in the grade you are in; however, student designed projects are important because students can communicate with their peers and have strong bonds, be busy and productive by working on tasks, and to focus better and be responsible.

Student designed projects will benefit students the most and help them in their daily lives by having them know the value of time, how to work with individuals, and how to have stronger communities and relations. These are really important when we get older and life becomes complicated.        ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
B321001BE0F5,"Summer projects are commonly used to keep students minds engaged and active during the long summer break away from school.

Although this seems like a big burden to students who are looking to relax during the summer after a long school year, it is crucial to keep students minds thinking about school so they are not blindsided by the large wrok load they recieve during the school year. A big question about these summer projects is who should have a say in the design and makeup of the assigned summer projects. I believe summer projects should be designed by teachers, but students should also have a say in the topic of the assigned projects to maximize summer productivity and prepare students for what is to come.

My main reasoning for why teachers should be the ones to design and have the final say in what project is to be completed during the summer is that they know what students will be expected to do during the upcoming school year. This means they can utilize the summer projects to help groom each student to be prepared for what is expected of them during the school year. If, for example, I were taking a chemistry class my senior year and it is the summer leading up to it, I would want my assigned project to help me understand what will be expected of me in that class. The summer project would be able to help me prepare for the school year and I would have a good understanding of what the class will be like if the project is designed correctly. School teachers have the best knowledge of what will be taught and expected of each student, so they have all the tools to design a perfect project that prepares students for the upcoming course. The summer projects can also be a good introduction into what will be learned in the upcoming year, which allows teachers to jump right into teaching as opposed to giving a long introduction to the course over an average of about 2 weeks. This gives students a chance to have an early understanding of topics that will be taught during the year, and can lead to better grades due to a deeper knowledge of topics as opposed to coming in cold and seeing the curriculum for the first time ever.

Although it is important for teachers to design and assign the proper summer project, it is also important that students have a say in what they will be working on in their time off from school and stress.

It is extremely difficult to stay engaged in a project during the summer because everyone has their mind set on seeing friends and going on vacation since it's supposed to be a break from learning. This is why I believe that it is vital for students to have some freedom in their summer projects to personalize it and make it about something they enjoy. I know from personal experiance that when I am assigned a summer project that is dull and sparks no pesonal interest, it makes the project dreadful. This makes the summer projects very difficult to complete because for kids it's hard to set our mind to something and work hard at it if we are not passionate about it. Obviously if students had complete control over the summer assignments, they wouldn't be very productive for anyone. Because of this, I feel the best way to assign a summer project is by teachers giving students a structured outline explaining what needs to be completed, while still giving students the freedom to make it about something they find interesting. This helps spark creativity in students while also providing them with the tools to be able to succeed in the upcoming school year.

My last reason on why there should be a shared responsibility between students and teachers when assigning summer projects has to do with the completion of the assignment. As a student, I can say first hand that many students put off assignments till the last week of summer because no one wants to be working incredibly hard after doing it for an entire school year. That being said, there are many ways that teachers can find a common ground in what interests students but still benefits them.

Despite popular beliefs, there are actually ways to make summer assignments enjoyable and not have them stress out students with an overwhelming workload. For example, If a teacher was assigning a math project to be completed over the summer, they could incorporate real life activities for students to go into the real world and collect data for a certain topic, and then have them form a project on their findings. This keeps students happy because although they still have to make a project, they are making it based off of their own research and findings in the real world.

I believe this would maximize the completion of the product as it is interesting to students and keeps them being creative so it doesn't feel as much like a stressfull school assignment, but more like a personal project.

In conclusion, it is important for teachers to have the overall responsibility to design the summer projects due to the fact that they know what the students need to prepare for, and can help them realize what will be expected during the school year. This will also benefit both the students and teachers in that the kids will already have an understanding of subjects, leading to less time wasted by teachers giving introductions.

The student-teacher collaboration will help keep students interested in what they are completing, and help them have a mental drive to complete the assigned tasks, while also guiding them in the right direction to begin the next school year.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
A7D79F1D4485,"The last day of school is a day most students are eager to reach. For three months of the year, things like waking up early, studying, and homework aren't daily stressers. However, some teachers will assign summer projects to assure that their students continue their learning over the break, and that they are adequately prepared for the class. These assignments are not nearly as burdensome as many assigned during the school year, and though most students dread the additional piece of work, summer enrichment projects are overall beneficial to a students education. Required summer enrichment projects should be designed by teachers because teachers know the class curriculum best, take the material seriously, and can use the project as a way to familiarize the future students with the teacher's preferred assigment style.

Most classes that require extra preparation in the summer to keep up scholarly habits and skills are generally more advanced courses. Often times in my experience, the summer assignment is simply review of skills that have already been learned. Going from almost no mind stimulation for three months to a constant, rigorous academic schedule can be an immense change. Summer projects can help a student prepare for the class with the information that will be most beneficial to them. Who knows the curriculum of a course better than the teacher of that particular course? Teachers generally know their subject material in and out. They know what is usually the hardest for students to understand and what the easiest is. By looking at data and statistics from the success rates of various units in past years, they know the skills that a student must have mastered in order to succeed in their class. Core subjects like Math, Science, English, and History, generally follow patterns of success with different subject material. When a majority of mutliple classes from many past years struggle with one area of the class curriculum, the chances of the upcoming classes struggling with the same thing are high. Teachers can use this knowledge to put together a project that either reviews foundational concepts, or introduces the basics of more complex concepts to better prepare students. With success as the main goal, a teacher is able to provide a summer project that would be the most beneficial to one of their future students.

Many high school students are infamous for their lack of motivation, organization, and time management skills. The general population of a high school is constantly looking for ways to cheat their way through the system, allowing for minimum effort to be put in. Everyday, new or useful hacks or shortcuts are made known.

While ""work smarter, not harder"" is a common and useful saying, many high schoolers interpret this the wrong way. Cheating the system is not working smarter. All around my high school, there are cases of stolen test answer keys used to cheat and online answer keys found and used to lighten a homework load. The attitude of a teacher towards work is much different than that of a teenager. Summer assignments tend to automatically rub students the wrong way. If it were left up to a student to design a summer project, it would most likely be something ridiculously easy and irrelevant to important and/or pariticularly challenging class material. Teacher's assignments are given out not to occupy but to educate. If students were able to design a summer project for future students, the chances of it being as beneficial as what a teacher would assign are slim. Teachers don't have a ""cheat the system"" mentality. They will give out work that will enrich a student even if it may take more time and/or effort to complete. Teacher designed summer enrichment projects will increase a student's chances of being successful in their new class.

A new school year brings on many changes and challenges in everyone's lives. Both students and teachers must adapt to the new environment presented to them each year. After having been familiar with a teachers preferred type of assignment, many students find the new school year to be intimidating and uncertain. Teacher designed summer projects allow the instructor to give their students a taste of what the new school year might entail. If a particular teacher feels that reading and annotating a textbook is an important aspect of the class, their summer project could and should reflect that. This gives the students an opportunity to prepare, practice, and perfect their annotating skills for future assignments throughout the year. Perhaps a teacher assigns reflections as a part of class work frequently. They might add a reflection component to whatever project is designed and then assigned to the students in order to signal to the students what to expect in the coming year. Not only does this give students a chance to practice a skill is regarded as important and assigned frequently by the teacher, but it also gives some clarity to what the future may hold. This clarity can be very calming and might take away some levels of stress in a student preparing for the next school year. Practice and preparedness from teacher designed projects allows students to better succeed in their course.

Teachers know their class. They know what is going to be most challenging and what a student would benefit from mastery the most. Because a teacher knows the class curriculum best, takes the material seriously, and can prepare the students for common upcoming assignments, teachers should design their own summer enrichment projects. The main goal of any summer project is to better assure success of a student in a particular class. If every student is going to have an opportunity to succeed, they must be given summer projects that are teacher designed, not student designed. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
DA2FC1DDF83D,"At last it's summer time! I can sleep in everyday and do whatever I please. However, I still have to consider the unpleasant thought of finishing my summer assignments before the end of summer vacation. Although some may say otherwise, summer projects should be student-designed because it gives students the opportunity to choose the material they want to learn and it will motivate students to complete the projects on time rather than wait until the end of the summer.

First of all, school projects should be student-designed because it gives the students the opportunity to choose the material they want to learn which will make the projects more interesting since they will be geared towards their interests. For instance, when I was in 10th grade at Generic_School, I was assigned a project along with a group of students in my AP World History class where we were to research any period of history and make a PowerPoint presentation to present to the class. As a group, we agreed on choosing the Great Depression because we all had a decent amount of background knowledge about the specific topic. Therefore, each group member could contribute their views and researched information to the presentation, meaning there wasn't one member who didn't participate in the project. Furthermore, another instance would be when my sister, Generic_Name, was assigned a project in her orchestra class at Generic_School where she was given the project to find a song online and play it for the class. The thought of choosing her own song brought her so much joy since she could choose a song by some of her favorite artists: Owl City, Taylor Swift, and Katy Perry. She decided on choosing the song Blank Space by Taylor Swift becuase it wouldn't be too challenging or to easy for her to play. Each day, leading up to the due date, she practiced for at least an hour so she could play for the class without any mistakes. Generic_Name forgot that she was doing a school project because of how much fun she was having playing the song. Projects don't have to be something to dread completing when they can be easily geared towards the students interests, leading to substantial success in the end.

Additionally, school projects should be student-designed because it movivates students to complete their work on time rather than wait until the end of the summer to tackle the assignments, which will overall boost their performance. For example, In the summer of 2019, I was assiged to read at least one book and prepare to talk about it the next school year. Rather than having to read some random book picked by the school or county, I was able to choose a book that I would actually read for the purpose of entertainment, in contrast to just reading it because it was required. I chose to the novel,

IT, by Stephen King because I enjoy the horror genre and he happens to be one of the most well known horrer fiction writers. I started out reading the book during the first week of summer with no major thoughts, that was until I realized I had been reading for two hours, wanting to read more and more. I became intrigued by the story and wanted to know what would come next. After only a week, I managed to finish the novel, the time flew by so fast because I was genuinly having a good time reading which rarely happens. Another example is when the Korean singer, Generic_Name, on the Korean surivial show known as Produce 101, was given the task during the first week of the competition to choose a dance for her assigned idol group. After congregating with her group, Generic_Name had her mind set on the dance to the song Into The New World by Girls Generation. The song fit perfectly with the group in a sense that the choreography was not too advanced for each of the members to learn, but it still looked smooth and well put together when done well. When the day of the dance battle came, Generic_Name and her group danced to the best of their ability, putting a lot of emotion and hard work into the dance. As a result, her group came in first place which meant that every member in the group was saved from elimination that was to take place that week. When people are given the the task that involves an interest of theirs, they will be likely to excell at that task.

Some may say that when students are given the opportunity to choose what they want to learn, they will take advatage of that and pick something easy or irrelevant to learn. While understandable, that reasoning is flawwed due to the fact that teachers monitor students work in order to keep them on track. For instance, when I was in 7th grade at Generic_School, I chose a topic for my science project that went beyond the realm of 7th grade science. As a result, my teacher, Generic_Name, geared my in the correct direction by giving me a list of topics to choose from that correlated to the currect unit we were learing about. Some may also say that students get discouraged by the thought of summer projects in general, meaning they won't want to work on them at any cost. While understandable, that reasoning is flawed because when students are given the chance to choose something they feel strongly passionate about, they will be far more likely to work towards completing the project. For instance, when my friend, Generic_Name, was given the initiative to find statistics in his AP Statistics class at Generic_School, he chose to research statistics about his favorite game called League of Legends that included the number of people in each country

When given the chance, students can surely succeed and learn a lot of information when the school projects are student-designed. In our society, school work and school activities are predominately controlled by the administration such as teachers and staff, but students have just as equal ideas as everyone else about school work and can possibly better the education system by making school more enjoyable for students all around the world.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
6A14B4BFBFFA,"The enigma of summer projects. The summertime is a great time to learn something new and prepare for upcoming classes. Schools that offer summer projects to students should be designed by teachers, because they know best what they need to prepare their students for. Students who are motivated into taking the class, will do their required work. It shows that students who do not, should not take the class. Many classes that are assigned summer projects are college level classes and need the extra studying to proceed. Students should know what they are getting themselves into. Teachers would also have to grade the summer projects consistent. In fact, grading over hundreds of students papers is tiring but rewarding to learn students comprehensibility. Imagine it being student-based work, where the teacher would have no rubric to keep constant grades.

First, the students who choose to take the class. Depending on the class, there maybe limited seats available for students. For example, Psychology is a very popular class and only students with certain grades can take it as it is a limited seated class. Assigning teacher-based summer assignments could test students who actually want to take the class. That the class is not an easy A. Students who complete the project are expected to earn their spot. This makes the teachers teaching experience a bit easier, as they know what type of students they are getting.

Furthermore, the difficulty of the class. Depending on the level whether it is an advanced placement, college level class, or honor class; it is expected to study over the summer. Teachers make the best choices for their students especially on their summer projects. Teachers are informed of any changes made to the curriculum, this is crucial in college classes as the exam is very specific. For example, the College Board could decide to exclude a part of the exam, or add in new modules. The exams are constantly getting updated and teachers could use the summer projects as the best time to include new information the board has decided to add.

In addition, the rubric will be kept the same. This benefits both parties as for teachers they know exactly what answers they are looking for, and this would make grading hundreds of papers more efficient. For example, multiple students may have gotten a certain question incorrect, the teacher could then discuss the answer and overall deal with any confusion. For students, getting an answer wrong could allow them to reach out to another for the correct answer and solve questions together. Improving team work and social skills.

All in all, teacher-based summer projects are easier to grade. It tests students their dedication to the class and the level of understanding. It excludes any students who assume the class is easy or simply do not do their work. There are no shortcuts to complete the teachers project. Just like how there are no shortcuts in life. It also shows that students must be prepared for class beforehand and take responsibility. Especially goes for college level classes as changes are inevitable. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
CE94B3F26D2F,"Summer has finally arrived! No more waking up at the crack of dawn and doing three hours of homework each night. Cheers, to where the fun really begins! That is, until your parents get the email from your teachers explaining the project you have to do this summer. For most of my life, I thought the projects that were given to us during our summer break, was outrageous and too time consuming. Looking back at things now, if it wasnt for those summer projects then I wouldnt have been as prepared as I have been to proceed onto the next grade level. Students tried to protest against not having summer projects at all, but that idea was shut down fast. Instead, the board of education agreed to hold a national vote on whether or not the summer projects should be student based or teacher based. If the projects are teacher based students wouldnt slack in order to get the project done they will actually complete it and teachers are trying to prepare you, they know the material best and are trying to provide materials they know you will need in order to be successful this coming year.

Firstly, in order to continue learning throughout the summer teachers should create the summer project rather than it being student designed. Due to the reason that students would take it more serious than if they were the ones who could choose what the project was based on. For example, If the eleventh grade teacher gives all of her students a sheet of paper with a list of more than fifty books that the students are able to choose from, to help prepare them for next year, students know they have to read it and do all the work that comes along with it. But, if the students were able to design the project they could do, they would most likely choose the route that requires little to no effort to have to be put into it. They would choose the book that they have read over one hundred times in the third grade in which they have memorized every comic strip that was said in the book. Making sure that what is given to the students is actually going to help them in the long run and prepare them, shows the students that you truly care about their success in education. If students could design the project, they would do something the last week of summer that is, in which, super fast and easy and turn it in to the teacher the first day of school.

Secondly, to insure students are expanding their learning throughout the summer, teachers should be the ones to design the summer projects. They are the teachers and have gone through elementary, middle and high school just as most people have. But, they have also gone to college in order to be a teacher. They have learned specific material in which they need to know to become a teacher, regardless of the school. They have already have gone through their studies and have mastered the material. As students you are just now learning things as you grow and develop. To better understand, teachers go to school much longer than student to make sure that they know what they are doing and that they are able to teach the material to all different kinds of students. They know what we need to know and want to help prepare us for the new year abroad. Now if the students were to choose the project then they could possibly choose a subject in which is completely wrong and not needed for the following year to help you learn.

Thirdly, summer is the only time off school, besides the weekends, where students actually get a break from everything. They no longer have to worry about grades or the big test coming up, its just days full of warmth and relaxation. Summer time is the time of year when no student should have to be doing any sort of school work at all. All students go to school for nine months out of the year, which leaves the three months to do absolutely nothing. Although all students dislike the summer work that the teachers push on them, they dont understand how beneficial it is for them. Keeping your brain fresh with new knowledge everyday is what is needed in order to retain the information. Teachers dont assign the summer work to be evil toward you, they do it because they want you to be successful in the new school year. They want to set you up for success not failure.

Lastly, In order to be successful and retain all the information needed to help you prosper as a student in the near future, teachers should be the ones designing the summer projects. Teachers are helpful in many ways and ensure that they wants to best for you. They do all they can in their power in order for you to be successful. With projects that are teacher designed, students wouldnt slack to do the project, they would actually take time to do it and do it the right way and also the teachers are trying to prepare you for success, they know the material best and are trying to provide materials that they know you will need in the following year. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
98D53EBFE307,"Summer is in the air! The warm humid sun is burning the area, just like the summer projects that are assign to the students; however, like unexpected summer problems, you don't know what project you're assigned with. Some students may have easy projects, other students could have difficult projects. Student's could have the whole summer vacation turning into a project vacation; unless, students can design their own projects. If students are able to design their own project, rather then teachers designing the student's projects, then this project could be a piece of cake.

One of the reasons why students should be able to design their projects, is that they would be able to design their own topics. While researching a topic they have chosen, students might have a little bit of fun while researching/working on their project. Let's take the MYP as an example. The MYP, a project fair for sophomore students, let's the sophomore students design their own topic. Most of the sophomore students chose something they enjoyed doing, other sophomores students chose something they've never done; yet, have a ton of fun trying to design that topic. If you chose a topic that you aready know about, then you can get this project under a bag. To add in, students might also find something they haven't known before.

Another reason why students should design their project, is that they wouldn't have any stress related problems while working on their project. Students would be able to decide which level of difficultly they want to do while working on their projects. Let's say someone has a disability, like Autism or ADHD, that won't allow them to do what citizens normally do in this world. Students with these disabilities can decide what difficultly they want their project to be, so they wouldn't have to stress during the project. (Trust me, as a student with Autism, the level of difficultly is very important for a project.)

I think one of the reason's why teachers design the project, is because teachers might want to persuade their students to take a challenge. They might assign students about something important; however, students wouldn't understand that topic and may get confused. Teachers will assign assignments that would require research: furthermore, the student's are in a challenging situation. That's what teachers wants their student's to do.

Students might not know there'll be a situation that is very difficult to get though. If the teachers assign them a difficult challenge, the situation the student's in might become a piece of cake

Summer vacation always goes by like a child growing up too fast, so why won't a project do the same thing? You may never know what kind of project to expect when a teacher starts assigning assignments to students they don't know; however, if you're able to design your own project, then the project will be a spec that will wash away in an instance.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
E79BEA9BFC6E,"Homework over the summer break? No way! Many students believe we shouldn't have work over the break, however it is important to continue learning. Projects over the break should be student-based because, it allows them to chose a topic they will enjoy, they will continue to learn about new things and excel their knowledge, and lastly it will keep them occupied so they aren't constantly on their phones.

Projects over the summer may not be fun, however allowing the students to chose what they want to do will be more enjoying then a teacher-based project. Student-based projects don't always have to be that typical 8 page essay that students always dread. Students have the opportunity to go on an adventure and have fun with the project. Exploring something new is always the best way to learn. I have always believed that the journey is much better then the destination or final product. What matters most is that you are having fun while learning. This situation came up for me a while back. Over the summer I was given a science project. I was allowed to pick anything! I was so excited. I decided to learn about fish and how the enviornement affects them. Given the option of doing something I chose allowed me to venture out and explore. I decided to go to the aquarium. Being able to be let free with this project allowed me to learn something new that I may have never learned so much information about.

Student-based projects over the summer will allow the student to take the matter into their own hands. If it is something they are chosing, they will be more interested in that topic which will lead to the deeper exploration. I'm not a huge reader, so when I am given a book project on a book that doesn't intrigue me, I typically won't enjoy the reading which will cause me to put minimal effort into my project. It is not that I don't want to get a good grade, its that I didn't understand or relate to the book as if I was given the opportunity to chose my own book. It is a whole different story when it comes to the student being able to chose the book. If I was allowed to chose any book to read and complete a project on, it would allow me to research books that relate to me and my life. After reading the book, I will then want to show that I loved the book, causing me to show specfics that may have not been talked about in the book. I may have liked the book so much that I did research on the author and his personal life which would give me an enormous amount of examples I could write about/ talk about in my project.

Oh those phones! How many times over the summer have your parents asked you to put your phone down and do something? Trust me, it has happened to us all. Having these student-based projects will set deadlines for the students to finish the project, however they can have fun with it. Going along with the previous reasons, student-based projects will keep those dang phones out of the kids hands. We all know the parents will love this! Students who are given the opportunity to learn about something they like will keep them up off the couch, moving, and learning about something new. Allowing them to chose their own topic for the project will allow for an idea to spark in their mind, causing them to go seek out that information. Over the summer, I typically want to relax and hang out. There have been many times where I have gotten carried away with the time and caught myself on the couch all day. Giving the student-based project will divert them from becoming lazy and allowing them to go out and find something fun to learn about.

Summer is a time for a break, don't get me wrong. However we can't go that long break with out refreshing our mind of common knowledge. Giving these student-based projects will allow for students to continue to have fun over the summer as well as learning. Going a long time without learning often causes people to forget common sense and knowledge. This is why it's important to still learn over the summer. Lastly, allowing these students to have the leeway will let them go out and explore the world and not be so tunnel vissioned into the TV and their phones. You are always learning something new, however it always makes you happier when you learn about something you enjoy.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
101256FB2FB2,"Should students be allowed to design their own summer projects? Over the summer, many students find it hard to roll out of bed and prefer to procrastinate their summer assignments. The dreaded math packet holds the number one spot, but what if the students could choose how their homework is designed. There needs to be a way to inspire students to keep up with studies and find pleasure in the chosen topic. If students design their own projects they may find more interest in completing the assignment, a passion for their chosen subject, and a project to boost their grade in class.

Teachers always struggle to find a project that students will be interested in completing. Students want to enjoy the summer and not have to worry about taking time out of their day to study. When they design the project themselves they can incorporate the work into their daily lives and activities to make it fun. One student may choose to solve math problems around the mall while others, choose to shoot a soccer ball every time they mention a scientific kingdom. This will be an easy way to learn while completing many daily things and students will feel proud of their accomplishments.

When a teacher gives out a packet, students are not always pleased or excited about it. They normally consist of long word problems and that can often bore students, but lets say each word problem is a coordinate, one that leads to a park in the neighborhood or a friends house. After the student takes this long adventure they designed, they may find themselves enjoying the trip and the exploration they got to do. They went outside and got some fresh air while completing a summer project. In the future maybe the student wants to fly plains and travel. Now they can solve the math to accomplish those travel plans.

At the end of the year students stress about grades and the most common complaint is; how can I get my grade up for the end of the year. The teachers also have to search for simple projects to close the learning gap after SOL's. An easy way to accomplish this would be to assign a project, one that the students will keep with them into the summer. The students will be required to make their own, exciting, project by themselves. Instead of some boring old packet with 120 questions, this packet is tailored to their creative ideas. The packet they made may send them on an adventure through the mall or even a park. They will turn it in and the teacher will hand it back, after grading, for them to fill out over the summer.

Designing their own summer projects left the students inspired to reach for their goals and go into the next year with a more developed brain. All of this was possible because their ideas could become a solid base for amazing adventures. Students should get to design a project they feel best suits them, it may help them find themselves and their future in school.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

I believe schools should require students to complete projects during summer break. Most students do nothing during break, so they spend their time without learning anything new. It will help students be well educated while on break. The students would be motivated to do a summer break project if it was designed by them, the students. Doing schools projects during break will give students new knowledge, they will be educated once returning to school, and having the project be student-designed would motivate them.

Most students do nothing during break, so they spend their time without learning anything. Many students are not able to travel during summer break due to money or health problems, which is why they don't look forward to summer break. If a project is assigned, the student will work on it without hesitation. Working on an important project during break will encourage students to keep learning in school and out of school. Having a project designed by a student encourages other students to do it.

The students would be motivated to do a summer break project if it was designed by them, the students. Of course they would come up with the idea, then share it with a teacher, whom would decide if it's an idea that would benefit the students. The teacher would help the student by creating some requirements for the project. The idea is to create a poster about the subject the students likes best, and it should include information about the class and why it is a class to take. That will help with how well the student knows the knowledge of the class. It gives them a great experience and they get educated on their own.

It will help students be well educated while on break. For the most part students do not like learning any new material, which they consider to be hard. On the contrary, learning from home gives them comfort, and they work hard to accomplish the task assigned. Designed by students, the project is an activity they can enjoy. They wouldn't make it impossible to create, so that the students don't try. It is a project where they can expand their knowledge and be as creative as possible.

In conclusion, having students design a project for summer break is a great idea. It not only gives students, who don't get to enjoy a break, something to work on. It helps provide them with more information than usual which will help them be better in school, yet it also helps students be creative. Doing schools projects during break will give students new knowledge, they will be educated once returning to school, and having the project be student-designed would motivate them.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
C3C456F2758F,"During the Summer many children don't even go to the extent of keeping up with school and or education by any means, then once school arrives, their knowledge is stale and their memory can take a while to be refreshed and can potentially harm their grades and overall performance for a significant amount of time. This is why Summer projects should be assigned by teachers, to provide children with a task, to help further expand and maintain their knowledge and state of well being.

Giving students a task will be beneficial towards their knowledge.

Throughout the Summer, from experience, there will be days people will just sit around and do absolutely nothing. This can do nothing but harm the them. The brain is required exercise therefore, not challenging or applying the brain to anything could potentially reduce knowledge; with that they'll also lose their work ethic and lack performance come the school year. If students were given the option to ""create"" the project and the idea, they'll most likely be lazy, and the project will be frail and irrelevant to the main objective of the project in the first place.

Socially , having a school project during the Summer can also, provide people with social interactions they may not go about even in school rather that, their everyday life. Via their job it's a teachers job to ensure the education of their students and to provide them with the essential knowledge they'll need to succeed in life. Therefore, its not as if the teacher is giving a bunch of work for the student to complete with no context; it's meant to keep them occupied and provide them with work that won't only be beneficial to whoms knowledge, but also, it can very well be fun and be one of the highlights of their summer. Giving students this task will ensure they engage in activity to help benefit their knowledge, work ethic, social life, and well being.

During the Summer, people, especially children, aren't always prone to everyday activity; this can be a very large set back to their well being on many different standpoints, their knowledge can be reduced as well as their overall motivation and work ethic. Giving students a task will allow them to expand their mindset and even their goal exploratory with their overall life. Laying around doing nothing, and or not complying to any form of education, will be a major set back to a student's well being; with a lack of interest or occupation of any means, they'll achieve high levels of boredom, which could potentially lead to behavioral changes; such as, depression, and bad behavior... as in pursuing bad actions and or illegal actions. This is why giving students a task over the Summer, via their teacher, will ensure the safety of their well being and the maintenance of their knowledge.

In conclusion, over the Summer projects assigned by a teacher are beyond advantageous and a great way maintain knowledge, further expand knowledge, and protect whoms well being. Given the circumstances of today's society, people, especially minors, are more than likely to engage in negative conduct if they lack an interest in something or an occupation. This is why giving a task, especially a school oriented project, will keep them on the right track and derive only good conduct and benefactors.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
5019D1373922,"For most schools, there is usually some sort of learn-at-home based activity for the summer, but should these lessons be teacher-designed, or student-designed? The idea of summer homework is not a big excitement for most students. Before the school year ends, they should be able to discuss with their teacher or professor what they will be doing. Teachers should allow their students to design learn-at-home summer activities because if they do so, students can have motivation to complete it, and can collaborate together to make it a fair overall project.

Firstly, motivation for anything is key. A lot of students lose motivation throughout the school year, and this is a big factor as to why students do not complete homework at all, or complete it on time. If students are able to self-design a big project that is given over the summer, the motivation will be self associated. They can engage themselves in the topic, and have a drive to complete it because it is something that they chose to get done. Students would be able to pick an idea that they think would make them actually be interested in learning about, and as stated earlier, motivation would come along on its own.

Following motivation, comes the idea that a student-designed project would have to be a fair length, but also accessible, and manageable to complete throughout the summer. Some students may not have technology at home, and classmates can talk amongst themselves to figure out weather they want it to be hands on, or something using technology. Other factors come along, like long periods, or multiple periods of vacation for certain families. Students can collaborate to give a rough time of how long the project will take, so they can plan ahead a time period that they can complete it in. Being able to work together makes students more comfortable with creating and capitalizing on a project. Students should lead the design process, with approval, and some guidance by the teacher.

Lastly, there is probably many people who would argue that a teacher-designed summer project is more beneficial and better put together than a students. This is false, because teachers don't accomodate for anybody but themselves. They can assign project guidelines that can take the entirety of a month out of a students summer, and assign a topic or prompt that nobody in the class is interested in. This drives down motivation levels severely, causing students to keep pushing off this project until the last minute, because nobody is interested in completing it. Yes, teachers know the best way to teach during the school year, and assign well put together projects and homework then, but students need to create and come up with the challenge that they are gonna be completing during the summer.

In conclusion, summer based learning should be designed by the collaboration of students, because it increases the drive and motivation to get it done, and they are able to craft an overall project that is fair not just to themselves, but to everyone in the class. Working together is a trait that many students are gifted with; with certain restrictions put on the project by the teacher, (to not make it too simple or short) lets the students build a project that is the best for them. This idea lets students be successful, and strive for a great experience in the summer with a project that will actually keep them engaged.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
167C0474C7F6,"Most students agree that summer is the best time of the year. Summer is the time to relax and forget all about school. However, some schools, in order to keep their students learning during break, they require students to do summer projects. PBL or project based learning is a great way for students to learn specific things through their own research and experiences by making a project showcase or discover a topic. But should these projects, during the summer, be designed by teachers or students? Although many believe that these summer projects should be teacher-designed as the teacher is the most trusthworthy to design as they are also the ones to grade the project, these projects should be student-designed as to not stress the students during their break, summer activities can be implemented into their projects, and allows for passionate creativity.

The big difference between normal projects during the school year and summer projects during summer break, is that normal projects are almost always teacher-designed since teachers are the ones grading the project, giving a guideline to follow will be the best for the teacher to understand what a student learned. These projects are also during the school year where students are always in a mindset to learn and focus on their work. Summer projects, however, are during summer break where students' mindset are relaxed and not focused. To have projects during break already makes a student stressed but to also have them teacher-designed adds another level of stress. The pressure of knowing what is being graded and matching up to the teacher's expectations during what is supposed to be a pleasurable, relaxing, and free-minded time, will damage the student's mentality and work ethics later in life.

Summer the time to explore and try anything, such as traveling a to a new country, trying a new sport, learning an instrument, or just hanging out with friends. These activities make for perfect topics that students could choose from if the summer projects they do are student-designed. With teacher-designed projects, the teacher doesn't know what kind of activities their student does during the summer and will result in a difficult topic that will be hard for the student to connect to. By allowing student's to design their projects by implementing their summer activities in their project, it will result in a higher quality of work as student's would like the activity they choose, not stress them or detract their focus from the project itself, and allows the student to connect with their project.

What do Jeff Bezos, a homeless man, and a student all have in common? Passion. Everyone has a passion no matter who that person is. From the richest man in the world, to the poorest of the poor, they all have passion. The problem is that many don't get to express that passion because of certain restrictions such as doing a specific job because it makes a lot of money, doing a specific action because society expects it, or needing to complete a specific project designed by someone else that disallows you from including your own interests. When one is allowed to express their own interests and ideas, passion will follow as inspiriation and creativity sparks from one's likings and view of the world. If summer projects were student-designed, students would be allowed to be as creative as they wanted to be with their project, become more passionate as the project would follow their interests, and would find themselves easier as an individual.

Although many people think that these projects should be teacher-designed as the student could easily be lazy with it and not put in any effort at all, would be in an entirely different scenario as these are projects assigned in the summer. A time where the student's mentality is not of focus and hard-working, but of free-mind and exploration. Teacher-designed projects would be perfect for during the school year as the teacher would be able to know exactly how the student is learning and fits with the hard work mentality the students develop from the beginning of the year. However, this situation does not need the hard work mentality but a free minded mentality to fit with the relaxed work ethics during summer break.

Overall, teacher-designed projects are the obvious choice for most projects during the school year but for summer projects, student-designed will fit more with the mentality and work ethics that summer break brings. The students should not be stressed with the same school mentality they've had all year and should be allowed to explore new things instead of being restricted to a topic they can't connect to. Student-designed summer projects would also give students the chance to express their passion to other students and teachers by letting their creativity be free. Everyone has a passion and schools should be trying to help the student find that passion. Although teacher-designed projects find the academics, student-designed find the individual.        ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
3E866ECC376A,"Every summer students are required to complete a project to ensure learning is being accomplished. Some say that these projects should be teacher-designed others say they should be student-designed. A high school student once stated that "" a project over the summer sounds boring "". Others must think how can one make a project during summer fun if its teacher-designed? Summer projects should be student-designed because it makes each student want to be creative, enthusiastic, and have better learning opportunities.

Critics say that summer projects should be teacher designed because it keeps the student following a stricted guideline. Although following a specific guild line ensures the student will complete the required task thoroughly, it forbids the act of joy. Students are already in school for ten months of the year following a stricted guideline in how to complete a certain assignment, if schools assign a teacher-designed project over the summer it would feel as if they are coming in the way of students summer break. If this project is teacher-designed it would also show students that schools are more biased towards their opinions.

Summer projects should be student-designed because it makes the student want to be more creative with their assignment. A student would show creativity by choosing the colors they like or making it into something that shows significance to them. This would give the project more depth and meaning rather than a simple teacher-designed assignment. Creativity is important in a student's life because it helps speak what is on their mind and generate from there. Completing a regular teacher-designed project would restrict the idea of building from your life and experience.

During the summer students minds are not focused on school, giving students the ability to design their project would make them enthusiastic towards completing it. On a usual school assignment students wait till the last minute and stress about what to and how to do it, with being able to design your project there would be less procrastination and more completion. With student-design projects each student has more options in what they can create, making them look forward to completing the task with excitement. Most school assignments don't entertain students while accomplishing them, if schools let students design their summer project they can make it fun. For an example, a group of students can plan on working on this project together and be enthusiastic because their options are open and would also give them the ability to help each other with new ideas.

Lastly, summer projects should be student-designed because it increases better learning opportunities. If students have the ability to design their own project they would be choosing what they have to do the research on. This would increase learning because it would interest an individual student and make them want to gain more knowledge about a specific topic. Another way learning opportunities are increased because after the completion of this project, teachers could asses the student on proving that they actually learned over the break. This would also benefit the teacher in learning something new.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because it promotes creativity, makes it enthusiastic, and increases knowledge. Completing a creative, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable project over the summer sounds far more entertaining than a teacher-designed project. With creativity you can make the project interesting, with enthusiasm you can make the project fun, and with knowledge you can never have enough. Students would have an entertaining and educating summer all in one.         ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
C79B9A5B5D13,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the summer months. Some students are not motivated to do the assignment for a variety of reasons. These students tend to have one thing in common, they do not want to do the project. The implementation of student-designed summer projects would make students more motivated and more willing to do the assignment. Student-designed projects also give the opportunity for students to express their ideas.

Motivation is very important for students to complete assignments. Summer projects, designed by teachers, are often very lengthy to complete and are often very boring. Student-designed summer projects would change the motivation that students have for summer projects. By students creating the assignments, assignments would be more understanding of students'

needs and learning strategies. Projects also may be more fun to complete. These factors of a student-designed summer project would help students be motivated to complete the project.

Tying into motivation, students would be more willing to do the summer project if it was student-designed. Students are used to a similar project every summer. Student-designed projects would shake up the summer assignment for every grade level, and be different every summer. Students would not be as unwilling to do the project if it were different every year.

Students also feel the need to express their ideas. Student-designed summer projects would give the students creating the project an opportunity to express their ideas and learning styles. It would help give students the opportunity to create something they are excited about. Collaboration on project ideas would give students and teachers an idea as to what every student wants and doesn't want in the project. It is important that student ideas and needs are taken note to create the project.

Schools that require summer projects should let their students design them. Some students and teachers may not like the idea because it gives students freedom to express their ideas. But, it is important for students to continue learning during the summer, and student-designed summer projects would help students continue to learn over their break. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
05CE48E8193E,"Summer projects should be student-designed because it would motivate students to complete it, it's their break, and it would make it a little more fun for them. Assigning work over summer defeats the purpose in giving students a break to enjoy themselves, so I think they should make life a little easier for the students and let them design their projects. School is stressful and consumes most of the year, students need as much of a break as they can get for the short three months they get off.

As a teenager myself, I can honestly say some of us, (including me), have a little bit of trouble getting motivated. Whether it's our job, school work, or just simply cleaning our rooms, it can be a struggle for us to get off of our phones to do it. Something I have noticed is that when I have control over a situation, I am more motivated to do it. Summer projects would be no different. I know when I get a hand in designing my school work, there is a much higher chance I will actually want to do it.

Life as a teenager is more stressful then most people think. We have to focus on our grades, getting into college, and becoming an adult. Some of us even have a job to balance on top of that! Those are just a few examples of why teenagers need the three months on summer break to relax. Summer is an escape of the daily stress teenagers have to endure. It is only fair to allow the students freedom to design their own projects over their break from school.

School is one of the main focuses in life as a teenager. We are faced with a steady stream of work and knowledge during the school year. Even when we are out of school, we must choose which college to start the next chapter of our life at. The constant stress of our GPAs and test scores is too much to handle at times. Why must we extend this into the summer? I think allowing students to take their work into their own hands allows them to have a little bit of fun while still learning, and what better time to have fun then summer?

On the flip side, I understand why schools would want the teachers to design the projects for students. If teachers are designing it, there is less of a possibility of it not being educational. With that being said, students are ultimately the ones doing the project over their break, so I think it is only fair they have the power to design it themselves.

Teachers have nine months to teach students things they need to know. I think this is an abundant amount of time, if spent correctly, and there should be no need to extend work over summer break. If schools give out work to be completed over the students' break, by all means, students should have the ability to design it. Summer projects should be student-designed because it would motivate students to complete it, it's their break, and it would make it a little more fun for them.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
416FEFFA5DC6,"As the word 'summer' enters you mind, the thought of a beaming sun, turbulent waves, and tropical islands may subconsciously enter your mind. Summer time is the longest break given to students within the United States education system, this evokes the fear that with all this time spent out of school, students will begin loosing their ability to learn. Some schools are deciding to tackle this issue by administering summer projects during break to assure that students continue their education. With that being said, the question of who gets to design these projects must be asked. Should teachers be given another responsibility on their shoulders? Or should students be given the freedom to create their own educational project? To ensure that students receive both a resting period from the rigor of school while maintaining their educational abilities, they should be given the ability to design their own summer project. By allowing students to do so, projects can be tailored to meet individual academic rigor, be altered to fit personal goals of the students, and provides a more fun and engaging activity which will motivate them to learn.

It is no surprise that each student in the educational system has their own set of challenges and intellectual abilities. Forcing the same content to each student completely neglects this fact. Some students may feel extremely challenged while others may feel as if they are not being challenged enough. To combat this issue, students should be provided the ability to choose the rigor of their own summer project. As a result, each student will be challenged just enough, to the point where are are 'on their toes' academically, but do not feel consumed by the content of the work itself. Many of the world's accomplished scientists felt suffocated in the curriculum mandated environment of school, and were only able to thrive when afforded the opportunity to curate their own work. For example, Albert Einstein. Einstein himself struggled in school and eventually lead to him leaving the education system. His greatest findings, however, came when he was given the ability to create his own project. By doing so, Einstein could find things that challenged him, even though it was different from what the school system had implemented. Some people may argue that allowing students to set the bar on their own academic rigor will allow them a scapegoat to choose easy topics. Education is a self discovered path that must be navigated by the student. Apart from the fact that teachers already have so much on their plate, and adding project planning on top will place more stress on them, a student has the right to challenge themselves as needed. This does not mean that a student is alone in this path. Teachers should be given the ability to approve and/or disapprove of project ideas. Therefore, both parties can find a happy medium. The intensity of the project being custom tailored to the student will allow them to better comprehend the information in a way that is not driving a hatred towards education

With that being said, student-designed projects also give children the opportunity to focus their content around personal goals and interests. The project itself can be used as an exploration tool for student in what they hope to be their future career, or a subject they show high levels of interest in. For example, a student interested in medicine has the opportunity to learn about medicine; this way she has more context when deciding what she would like to do in the future. If teachers were to design their projects, it would be impossible to ensure that the interests of every single student is met, hence, allowing students to decide what they choose to learn about warrants the ability for them to learn what they love. This information they gain could deem to be vital when they decide minor things such as what classes to take the following year, all the way to larger aspects such as what careers they would enjoy. Many of the top chief executive officers in technology companies struggled with this situation. Their schools did to provide them the ability to explore different topics and careers, hence they left and decided to tackle it themselves. People like Bill Gates on the other hand were given opportunities in school to explore computers and software, he credits all his success to these very opportunities given to him. This demonstrates the importance of sanctioning the ability for students to learn about their focuses, this way they will not only learn, but understand their strengths and weaknesses.

Finally, by allowing students to design their own project, the learning aspect becomes more exciting and engaging. Motivation is essential when trying to get students to learn and cooperate. This characteristic can be hard to cultivate when students are forced to learn subjects that do not excite them. If given the opportunity to choose their own projects, students will pick something that intrigues them. This curiosity will make it easier for them to want to learn and eventually continue learning. Many successful people end up doing well in fields that are similar to their favorite subject in school. This shows the probable direct relationship between enjoyment in subjects and eventual work ethic when it comes to these subjects. Some may argue that this will prompt students to choose a childish project, however it is important to remember that there are still guidelines placed on the project. Teachers should still be granted the ability to view proposed project topics and either accept or reject them. Nonetheless, enjoyable projects will motivate students to actively learn.

Summer should no longer represent a time where students loose previously gain knowledge. Education is an extremely important aspect of student's lives and to ensure that they foster their love and passion for learning, students should be given the opportunity to design their personal summer projects.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
823A09BFA77B,"Schools loves to see their students grow academically and know that they have accomplished new things through out the year. When it's time for summer break to begin, students will never pick up nor read another textbook again. The schools doesn't want their students to lose their knowledge over the course of their summer break. Some schools are recommending summer projects during the summer break to maintain their knowledge. Summer projects should be teacher designed project because they are able to reach out to the students and will also know what to expect from their students when they return.

Students tends to feel over whelmed when they can't function nor figure out anything educational. Therefore, teachers should help out by taking time out of their day to call the students to help them out with their projects. Daily calls from their teacher can help them concentrate more and to stay on task. Staying on task is important because, students will end up forgetting about their project throughout the summer break. By calling the students, teachers are able to answer any questions and concerns that the student may have ran into throughout the project.

An Addition, teachers will know what to expect from their students when they return back to school. Teachers would have the hard work done because they were able to plan out each individual assignment for the students. Teachers have been working with their students all throughout the year and know what to look forward to from their class. Teachers would know which students would need the most help. The teachers wouldn't have to back track on things that they've have already taught because they have helped them throughout the project.

Summer projects is a good way to keep the knowledge that the students learn during the school year locked in. Students wouldn't have to stress over any obstacles because they're teacher were there to help. Also, teachers would have it easier to grade things from the summer projects because they planned them way ahead. Students will also come back to school with the same knowledge that they left with from school back to school.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
13B7ABDC0051,"If you were to design a students entire project scheme are they actually learning anything or even do it. Students tend to do better and learn more on projects when they have the chance to get creative with their assigned task. Instead of just researching what a teacher has designed for them.

For example, if you design a project for the students and the topic is on a book they were supposed to read over the summer. That's not really showing that the student learned anything it just shows that he or she was able to follow instructions given by the teacher. If you give the student a topic to learn over summer and let them plan out there project their ability to teach themselves and actually learn will increase.

Also, by letting them design the project you will get a variety instead of the same project type from each student. Different projects from each student give you the chance as a teacher to pin-point the students who learned and the ones who didn't. Which makes it easier for you to grade them and offer help to the ones who didn't do as well.

However, most students won't need help because they have the chance to get creative. Creativity will be a big help in improving the learning abilities of students. This chance will spark something inside of them and drive them to wanna take time to understand it then have fun designing their project for the topic. If the teachers designs it the projects will be turned in bland or maybe not turned in at all.

In conclusion, if you give them the freedom to do it in their way you will see how much they learned over the summer because they had the chance to show you how they learned it in their own way. And not just doing something that was planned out for them.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
7B52C05A4BDB,"Does your school do summer assignments? Some teachers give summer assignments that require too much or take the whole summer to finish. This statement leaves you thinking, should students make the summer assignments or teachers? I believe it should be student-based assignments, one reason why is that these assignments would allow students to be creative in their own ways. My second reason is that if students make these assignments they can relate in so many different ways. Here is why these are my reasons.

Making these assignments student-based makes the students think of creative things to do. Critical thinking would be the number one outcome of these projects. Students shouldn't be allowed to make the assignments to easy because although they are student-based assignments, you will still have to think about how the teachers feel and what they think about it. Allowing these students to be creative with these assignments is a very good thing. They will be encouraged to think out-of-the-box. They will create fun things that teachers probably couldn't think of.

When creating these projects, students will be encouraged to work together. This will allow students to relate to each other, creating different ideas. Although, relating to each other when creating these projects is a great thing, some students will think otherwise. Some students will say that they enjoy the summer assignments that teachers give and don't want students to take that away. I personally don't like the summer assignments teachers give us because they require the whole summer to do. Kids like me want to have fun, not stay at home and read a book all day.

In conclusion, I strongly believe students should make these summer assignments, allowing us to critically thing and be creative. Teachers want to make you critically think but their assignments are boring and always the same. We need students to put a fun and interesting spin on summer assignments.

5B5A88772B1B,"The volcano erupted with great force, shaking the room and everything inside. Students screamed while my teacher clapped and jumped for joy. I sat there, upset that I was unable to create something as big and impressive as Generic_Name's newspaper volcano. The presentation of our student-designed summer assignments made me realize that I was not given an equal chance to succeed due to the lack of teacher involvement. Summer projects should be teacher-designed, providing students with an equal opportunity to score well.

All students do not have access to the same resources. In third grade, my teacher gave my class the opportunity to do a summer project of our choosing. It could be about any subject and there was no mandatory format for which the project needed to be presented. Parents were emailed the assignment two weeks before the due date, which was the first day of school. Within those two weeks, I was at daycare everyday while both of my parents were at work. I got home right around bedtime, leaving me no time to work on my project. Along with the limitations of time, my family did not have the ability to purchase materials; I had to use what I could find around the house. My finished product, a short story written on a piece of scratch paper, received a sixty percent from my teacher who interpreted my project as having little effort put into it. Meanwhile, a student who had the money and time to make a large volcano out of newspaper and paint, earned a one hundred percent. Given the task of designing a project with no guidelines, I, along with other students, unintentionally demonstrated a stark difference in the quality of project we were able to create. Resources that influenced our grade, such as time and money, were not equally available to all of us. The difference in students' ability to access resources creates an unfair advantage when students are able to design their own project.

Clear instructions and guidelines are needed for some students to complete a task. Some people, especially those with anxiety or a lack of creativity, rely on rules to effectively complete an assignment given to them. I fall into this category of people, as I become stressed when a teacher allows me to create my own project. In English class, my teachers have assigned essays where students are allowed to write about whatever they want. There were no limitations on length or subject; it was student-designed. My friends and I struggled to write our essays because we did not know what criteria our teacher would be grading us on. Not having a rubric or set guidelines creating anxiety and self-doubt among us that affected our ability to complete the essay on time. I was so anxious to the point where I could not bring myself to write anything because I did not know if what I wrote would earn a good grade. Anxiety that prevents the completion of the assignment is provoked in students when they must rely on themselves to create guidelines.

Students can abuse the freedom of creating an individual assessment. Creating individual guidelines for what a project should focus on and include makes it easy for students to avoid learning to their fullest potential. In middle school, my teacher assigned a project with two objectives: read a book and create a project involving said book. She granted us the ability to design our own project because she thought it would create excitement around reading and encourage us to analyze the book and its meaning. In reality, most students researched a summary of the book and built their project around the information the internet had to offer. The grade they received on the project was not a reflection of their own work, but the work of another person. Students can take the freedom to design their own project as an opportunity to avoid the learning process entirely.

Student-designed summer projects result in an inequality in student achievement that is avoided when they are designed by teachers. Unequal access to resources, along with a lack of guidelines and monitoring on effective learning, makes student-designed projects less fair and effective than those that are teacher-designed.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
5E75902533E2,"Summer projects are normally always dreaded by students and pushed to last second to complete. These assignments are usually given with a rubric and step by step guide on how the project should be completed. So what would happen than if students were given the opportunity to come up with their own project to complete? A student-designed project would open a new creative outlet for kids, have a higher chance of actually being completed, and it would give the teachers a better understanding of what needs to be taught throughout the next school year.

Not every student learns the same way, some kids are audible learners, who can learn by just listening, where others need to be hands on and are very visual learners, who need to be able to see what they're learning. It's hard for teachers to be able to work around and create projects that can benefit every individual student. Student-led projects would allow each student to find and use their own strengths and weaknesses and work off of what helps them retain information the most. With very few structured rules, the kids can run with their crazy, out of this world, thinking that fades away as you get older. If anything was to come out of student- designed projects it would be the different approaches to go about learning, to help teachers creating projects in the future.

It's very hard for students to be motivated to do something given to them by a higher authority, normally kids are motivated by a single letter grade or by a percentage. There are some kids though that as great as the reward may be, if they arent interested in the topic, then the homework, project, or worksheet won't get done. With the choice for the student to create the project on their own, it's highly likely that it's gonna be something that interest them. If it's something they actually are interested in, the more willing they'll be to actually completing the assignment. Compared to teacher-designed projects, the student created projects have a higher chance of actually being completed. It's not necessarily driven by a letter or a number, but more by a student's want to learn.

Student-designed projects help teachers figure out what needs to be taught in the incoming school year. When teachers receive these projects at the end of the summer they can take a look and see what knowledge each child has on the topic at hand and what needs to be taught in the future. It almost saves time and energy for both the children and the teachers, who now can direct their energy to something that is new and or never been taught before. Every school year, for the first month or so, many teachers review lessons and topics that were learned the year before. That wastes a whole month that could have been devoted to teaching a new lesson or topic that may never end up getting taught or rushed through at the end of the year, due to time. Student-designed projects allows repetitive or rushed learning to never be an issue.

Overall, student-designed projects have many more advantages than teacher-designed projects. Letting students decide what and how they wanna learn opens a door for a positive learning environment. It helps put the joy back in learning and the educational system as a whole. Student created projects allow for kids to find their identity and learn new things about themselves, it encourages a greater probability in the projects to be finished and to the fullest potential, and it helps both the child and the teacher for the school year ahead. Student-designed projects are perfect for the future of education.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
578917C04D28,"Every year teachers across the United States of America assign summer projects to their students. These summer projects push students to continue learning new information over the summer.

Although some people may believe that a teacher should design these projects because a teacher will create a meaningful project that will benefit the students, the students should design their own project because they will pick a topic that interests them, they will be motivated to complete the project, and they will use their creativity and imagination to design something wonderful and exciting.

First of all, students who design their own summer project, will most likely design something that interests and excites them. For example, a student named Generic_Name was interested in earth science and decided to create a summer project where he found and labeled different types of rocks.

This project interested Generic_Name and pushed him to explore and learn about what he loves.

If a teacher had assigned a project to Generic_Name where he wrote a paper about inflation in the U.S. this project most likely would not have interested or excited Generic_Name. Another time, a different student named Generic_Name had the opportunity to design his own summer project, he chose to examine and record the life cycle of frogs and monitor their growth.

Generic_Name was immensely interested in biology and was thrilled to have the opportunity to create a project were he was interested and expanding his knowledge about the subject of biology. Students creating their own summer projects are more likely to choose a project that interests and excites them than if a teacher assigned a project.

Furthermore, another advantage to a student creating their own project is that the student will be motivated to complete the project. Students all over the country struggle to complete school work because they lack motivation.

If a student created his or her own project, they could create something fun that he or she would be motivated to put effort into and complete. A student could be assigned a project by a teacher about the Pythagorean theorem, but he would be so unmotivated to complete the project or learn any new information from the project. This defeats the whole purpose of a summer project, which is for students to continue to learn and expand their knowledge over summer break. If this same student was given the option to create his own project, he could design a project where he builds a miniature and rocket and launches it.

This student would be motivated to complete the exciting project that he designed, but more importantly the student would be learning new information while he completed the project.

Another example is when a student named Generic_Name decided to do a summer project where he studied different types of trees. Generic_Name loved being outside, so this project motivated him to look for different types of trees in nature and complete the project.

Generic_Name learned an enormous amount of information about trees while he was completing his project, but he also had an immense amount of fun.

When a student determines their own summer project they are given the option to pick something fun that motivates them to complete the project while learning new information.

Last of all, letting a student design their own project will activate the students creativity. In today's age students are not given enough opportunities to use their imagination and creativity. This is why students should be allowed to create their own project. The process of designing the project allows the students to use their creativity. For example if a student was given a boring project to complete over the summer by a teacher they would not be using their imagination or their creativity. This is not the way a summer project should be, a summer project should trigger the students imagination and excite them with possibilities. For example a young student in sixth grade created a project where she wrote a paper about what she wants to be when she becomes an adult.

This sixth grader used her imagination to write about herself in the future.

A teacher would not necessarily assign a project that allowed students to use their imagination. Creativity and imagination are both extremely important, this is why students should be the ones to design their projects to complete over summer break.

In conclusion, designing summer projects should be left up to the students, because the students will be more motivated to complete the project, interested by their topic, and forced to use their creativity. In the near future more and more teachers across the United States will let their students design their own summer projects.

All teachers should let their students be motivated, creative, and interested in what they are learning, this is why students should create their own summer projects.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
DC70105E6486,"Is it beneficial to have a student designed project or a teacher designed project.

Student designed work would be beneficial because students would be able to choose work that appeals to them, they would have more motivation to finish the work and it gives students a more diverse selection of topics to choose from.

However not everyone would agree with this position. Some people may argue that a teacher designed project would be more beneficial due to the teacher being able to pick topics that would help students reflect and learn on material set in their class. For example, If you were to be taking a English course the English teacher would most likely assign work about topics that you would learn and have learn about before. Nevertheless there are other view points to consider.

To begin with students would be able to choose work that mostly appeals to them. For example if a student were to be from a unique country or have a unique ethnicity they could choose to have their project be about their culture or beliefs. Doing so would have students more comfortable with their projects due to the fact that they are familiar with who they are and where they come from.

In addition due to being familiar with the topic students have chosen, students would have more motivation as to why they need to finish this project. For instance a student that is familiar with the topic they had chosen for their project would be more motivated to finish than a student that has low intelligence on the topic given. A motivated student always produces but non motivated students are never a guarantee. Nevertheless there are other view points to consider.

Finally, Student designed projects will guarantee that you end up with a diversity of topics from with no repeating composure and subjects. Consider as an example a science fair, when you visit a science fair you are presented with multiple subjects and projects on robots, plants, liquids, etc. Imagine if you were a teacher having to grade the same projects from start to finish what a bore. Nevertheless there are other viewpoints to consider.

In conclusion, would it be better that students choose their own topic? Yes, it allows you to have different viewpoints on the project and diversify the topic and possibilities of the project. Let students choose their own topics and projects now.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
D412E07BF06B,"What do you like to do in the summer? I'm sure the answer wasn't doing your summer projects for the next school year. In fact most high school students wait until the last month or even the last couple days of summer to do their summer projects, why is that the case? Summer projects are in place to help assure you are learning over the summer, and most of the time are assigned to you by the teacher. Doing the projects should be something you enjoy doing because it is break. However, most of the time they aren't enjoyable, so not doing the project and pushing it back is easier than doing the project. This brings the question should summer assignments be student-designed questions or teacher-designed questions. I believe that if high school students were to have a student- designed summer project rather than teacher-designed project then they will have interest in the project and able to showcase themselves as individuals, it will help them learn on a different level, but a teacher-designed project is purposeful and could help them in the future.

If high school students were allowed to have student- designed summer projects instead of teacher- designed projects then there would be more interest in doing the projects. Students wouldn't feel that there is an obligation to do the projects, but it's something to do for fun while on break. The project is whatever they want it to be. This gives them the opportunity to be creative, political, reflective, observatory, artistic, etc. Furthermore, this implies that there's more freedom in which they have the ability to use their imagination to create something for really what interests them. This would give the students an opportunity to be express themselves however they would feel to do so before the school year starts; it let's the teacher get to know them a little before being able to know them personally, like they would in the school year. Most summer projects do go in the grade book, and do count as a grade. Waiting until the last minute to do the project because you aren't interested in the topic, and then half fast doing it is no a good way to start the year. If student's got to choose their summer projects then there would be more interest in doing the summer projects, and less procrastination because students will actually find joy in doing the projects. This would also give the teacher a good reflection on who they are as a student before those connections are made.

Students will have the ability to learn a lot in a student- designed project. They will have the opportunity to learn in a different a way, a way that might be easier for them to understand. Students will also be able to gain knowledge about the subject they chose to do their project on. Since it is still a school project they will need to gather all information on that topic, which means research will have to be done to complete the project. However, in doing the research then they will learn a lot on the subject they are doing the project on. It gives them an opportunity to learn how they like to learn an gain information from how they wish to gain information from: interviewing people, online research, reading books, etc. They have total free range of how they would like conduct their project. Whereas, if a teacher is assigning a book report they would be forced to read the book, and forced to write however many pages on that book for a book report because those are the instructions, and that is what the teacher asked for. They wouldn't be able to express themselves, their views, or who they really are as individuals. The students would be constricted to only what the teacher has assigned, but the student-designed project would give them the opportunity to learn beyond what is being asked. A student-designed project will give the students free range of how they wish to conduct the project, and be able to learn beyond with no constrictions.

However some people may make the argument that to assure you are learning in the summer a teacher-designed projects would be the best bet. Having the teacher assign the project will ensure you that students will be learning from the project. These projects tend to go with the curriculum that you are going to have to have over the course of the school year: it's the sneak peak of what's to come. However, sometimes the projects aren't a sneak peak and are actually going to be your first topic that you will have over the school year, so it's imperative that you do them, so you can be prepared for class. Also with a teacher-designed project there will be more direction and instruction because there is more directions and or rules that will go along with the assignment, which may be better for some individuals so they can have a sense of direction for their project. It gives them more purpose in doing the project because they know what the outcome should be, and how it's planned out. This will give students a set plan of what to do. Some students may find the teacher-designed project better because there is more direction in the project, and you are able to ask questions about it if you truly don't understand what is going on or what is expected. A teacher-designed project is purposeful and will prepare you for the next year, but will also give you a better sense of direction for the project.

Although both arguments can be made that both a teacher-designed project and student-designed project will assure that you will continue learning over the summer's. In my opinion is better because a student-designed project will allow you to express yourself more and give you the opportunity to be more creative rather than a teacher-designed project where there are more rules and instructions that you will have to follow. There is less freedom when it comes to a teacher-designed project, and less ways to express yourself. Summer projects should be fun and a student-designed project is fun. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9CD52AD87E2C,"Over summer break, many schools require their students to complete a project. Teachers assign this to assure that the student will progress until next school year. The projects can be about any topic including: math, reading, science, or history. It all depends on the teacher you have and what class you have them. Some students are arguing that they should be allowed to choose their project rather than the teachers. Teachers should design these projects because they may see what the students need help with the most, they know better tactics to help them comprehend the material, and students may take advantage of the project and design something that will be easiest for them to do.

Teachers are able to see more of what students cannot. They may notice certain habits that are easy to fix that a student cannot adjust themselves. For example, Generic_Name wanted to make a science experiment but, his results were not accurate because he did not repeat the trial three times. Having teachers create the project this is less likely to happen. They can identify small mistake and help the student work through them.

Teachers also know the best ways to comprehend the subject they are teaching. In college, teachers are taught specific tactics in teaching so they can be sure their students will understand the material they are given. An example of this is, Generic_Name tried to solve a math problem on her own but, her teacher saw she was struggling and came to guide her through it. Having the teacher assign the project would be easier for them to help a student with questions. Some may argue with this because, they think they know what is best for them when really a teacher is better help because they are very educated in these types of situations.

Letting students choose their own project would be a disaster. Over a break no student wants to do a project but if they had to they would try to make it as easy as possible. This defeats the purpose of it and students would not be prepared for their next school year. Having a teacher design the project, they will be sure the student gets the education they need. This may be frustrating for the students but it will help them in the long run.

Teachers are able to identify what a student struggles with better. They can also create certain plans to help them understand a topic. Students will try to take the easy way out but, a teacher will assure they get the education they need. Therefore, teachers are the best choice in designing an over break project. Some people underestimate a teachers abilities when they should listen to what they have to say.            ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
24C5ED476177,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, but are unsure whether these tasks should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Psychologists have proven that in order for a person to actually remember information, that information needs to be repeatedly tested upon in order to remain significant in the brain. Summer break, as a huge gap in between learning periods, is massively disruptive to the cognitive process. Summer projects given over the break period should be moderately designed by the students themselves, because it gives the student control over their individual situation, it allows the student to express themselves creatively, and it removes pressure from school teachers; all while preparing them for life after school.

Students in school are constantly coddled, both by their parents and by the teachers in their learning environment. Giving an individual the ability to plan and create their own project is teaching them how to manage tasks on their own. It allows them to take into account their schedule, their own situation. Teenagers in high school spread rapidly after the school season has ended. Some travel, or get jobs, or go to summer camps; while others prefer to stay rooted where they are comfortably. Giving students that ability to decide for themselves how they are going to carry through with working around those activities is necessity. It allows them room to breathe. Putting the responsibility of caring for their own needs in students' hands gives them the much-needed abilities they will need for later in life.

Teenagers during the school year often don't get the opportunity to express themselves creatively and individually. Tasks designed during this time are teacher-designed and often follow a strict to-do list, which mushes everyone's work into one giant puddle of the same idea. Giving students the thumbs-up to style and create their own work assignment suddenly sets the bar way higher. Students are much more likely to branch out from the boring, black and white school project normally set by teachers. Difference in thought is an important concept that needs to be stressed to young people in society. No person is the same as any other. Setting an individual up for normality is setting them up for failure in the real world.

Finally, putting control in the hands of students takes the pressure off of teachers to work all year round.

Being constantly ailed with stress and work is definitely not beneficial for a persons' health. Teachers especially, who work in an environment surrounded by teen drama and the potential spread of sickness, need time off to recover. Forcing them to plan and grade massive projects during their supposed ""time off"" is unfair to them. During the school year, teachers often have no time to waste to spend with their own children, because they are so focused on having to grade those two-hundred papers for school. Giving teachers time away from the stress of other peoples' children gives them time to set aside for themselves and for their kids.

Some people may claim that giving students the ability to design their own project is not ""giving"" but ""forcing"". Students may need guidelines in order to work properly and receive a fair grade for their effort. Or worst case, they simply won't do the work. If a student needs a step-by-step process on how to recount their learning, then how will they expect to fend for themselves once they graduate? During high school, students need this time to learn more than just history or math, they need to learn how to manage their own lives. Giving them the right to design their own project is the best decision for both students and teachers.  ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
7A5D38D49C13,"Many schools require some students to complete summer projects to assume they continue with their learning during break. If something is meant for a student should not it be designed for a student? The projects are meant for students so they can continue with their learning then it should be student-designed because it would be based off the students, it would improve their skills to manage their own knowledge, and it would make them more intrigued if it was student-designed. For example, having a projects based off doing a research on someone you are interested on can motivate you do actually do the work and finish the projects. the projects teachers give out should change every year because education changes and need to be more motivated.

The reason why it should be based off the students is because it will make them feel more responsible and able to see it off their own perspective than other people. It was stated before that education changes every year so the projects teachers give out should be more interesting projects as in an investigator can be an example. Something that will get the students out of their comfort zones. Students would not chose something boring which would be reading a book, old scientist, and research things about the past, no offense. In education students should now be able to seek the types of projects they will be willing to learning about and yes, those project do include education but about the future or something that they want to learn more about. For example, some students would want to investigate more about cars, politics, education, money, computers, etc. It should be up to students to decide what more they what to learn about.

Learning how to manage their own knowledge and to improve some skills. If it were to be student-designed it would help students to learn more and actually motivate them about what they will learn in the future. Every student wants to change something in the world and can do it but not by forcing students what they do not want to learn, it would not help us in the future. Our skills should come from something we want to do. We should use what we are good at and pursue the type of carrer we want and if it were up to students to chose the carrer we want in the future it would be only fair we also get to chose the type of projects we want to do in our school.

The reason why it should be student designed and not teacher designed is because if it were to be teacher designed it would make the students not interested and make them lose their own focus in some type of way. Teacher are there to make students learn but not to control them by choosing what types of projects students will do over the summer. After all it is their summer vacation so, they should be able to see what type of project they want to do and willing to give up their time on. In Dual Enrollment and Advance Placement actually require to do a summer packet or summer project but it was up to the students to chose that course and were also informed that they would have a summer packet. But if some schools do require students who do not take those type of classes and just gives them a summer project it would be fair for students to chose their own project to do.

Indeed some school do try to give out projects but it should be up to the students what they would actually learn about and make them interest them more on that type of projects. Those projects are meant for students so they would not forget about school then it should be up to students to decide those projects over the summer. Students are willing to learn but only if they have an interest for it. As stated as before we can not force education over the summer so that is why it is meant to be student-designed projects.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
7B078F57DA7D,"Many schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Usually these projects are designed by the teacher to either help review past information or to introduce new information to the student. Most of the time these projects are not completed by many students. Summer projects should be designed by students because students who have already taken the class understand the basic knowledge to be successful in the class, students understand what other students will and will not do, and students know what the teacher expects of you.

Students who have already taken the class understand the basic knowledge to be successful in the class. For example Generic_Name, who has already taken Prerequisite Calculus the past year, knows exactly what they learned throughout the year and what basic knowledge she would have liked to know before she began the class. She could make a detailed assignment with all the information needed to be fully prepared for the class while the teacher can only speculate what the students know or dont know. With this information students will come better prepared to the first day of class because they already know what to expect and have viewed some of the information in the, student made, summer project. Another example of students understanding the basic knowledge to be successful in the class is when they all fail the test based on the summer project including, the ones who completed the project. Many of the students believe that the project did not help them fully grasp the concepts presented in it. With their new found knowledge of what is expected to be known on the test they can now help other students by giving them a summer project that will help them understand the concepts fully. This will keep students from having that first test be a failure and have to work the whole entire quarter to bring it up. Also with this information from former students they will be better prepared for the more advanced topics, now that they know the basics. Even if the teacher is able to make a summer project that helps the students understand the basics, they still don't understand what many students will and will not do.

Throughout the summer many students have multiple things to do including sports, work, and hanging out with friends that they have not seen in a while. Students understand this and realize what another student will and will not do. For example Generic_Name, who has recently taken AP Physics, was unable to finish his summer project because he does swimming, basketball, and soccer over the summer. He did not do the assignment because it required him to sit down for multiple hours at a time, that he did not have, if he wanted to fully understand the topics it was going over. Generic_Name and many other students would be more likely to complete the project if they were able to make the project have multiple small sections that can be completed in a half hour instead of 5 hours. This will allow the students time between activities to complete the project, making it more manageable. Many teachers do not understand the limited amount of time some students have over the summer for school work. Another example of students understanding what other students will and will not do is Generic_Name who has a very short attention span, and was unable to finish the 50 page summer project. Many students believe that if they were to shorten the project students would be able to complete it and have better results on it. With this shortened project students will be encouraged to complete it, knowing that it will not consume all of their free time over the summer. They will also show more work and have more quality work because they have less to do. This will allow them to understand the topics more and be more successful in the class. Even if the teacher was able to make a project that all students were willing to do, former students know what the teacher expects of his/her students.

Students who have already taken the class know exactly what the teacher expects from a student in order to have an A or a B in the class. For example Generic_Name, who is taking Prerequisite Chemistry, has failed almost every test and quiz in the class, but fully understands the concepts being taught. Soon he realizes that the teacher expects every bit of work to be shown for every single problem. This includes showing the formula before you even start your work. Knowing this a student would be able to inform another student of this in the summer project. This would allow the students to prepare to show all their work on the tests and quizzes by practicing on the summer project. Many teachers try to make an example on the first quiz by taking points off for students not showing all their work. With the student made project other students would be prepared for this and not fail by forgetting to show all their work. Another example of a student knowing what the teacher expects is when the teacher makes all the work optional including the summer project but, still expects you to know the information. In the summer packet students will be able to inform other students of what information is important to know going into that first week of school. This will allow the students who complete the assignment to be prepared for the school year. Even if the teacher helps the students by telling them the more important information on the packet students who have already taken the class know the basic knowledge needed to pass the class and know what student are willing to do.

In conclusion summer projects should be designed by students because students who have already taken the class know what the teacher is looking for in the students, and know the information needed to pass the class with an A. Also students understand that many students have very limited time to complete a huge assignment over the summer; therefore, they will account for that while creating the project. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
03739A8DFD62,"Students are stuck doing summer assignments during their vacation. Various teachers give students assignments to do on their break and these kids have no time to enjoy it. If summer assignments are student-designed rather than teacher-designed, students are able to enjoy their summer vacations and be able to show what they know and what creativity they hold. Although some may believe otherwise, creativity, diversity of projects, and comprehensibility of the concept proves that summer projects should be student-designed.

One reason why summer projects should be student-designed is the creativity of the project. Instead of one strict guideline for the projects, students can get creative and go above and beyond and be able to put more effort into them. A science teacher gave all of his students a project on the idea of photosynthesis. The kids had to color in a picture of a cell that he provided and label the parts of the cell. When the school year began, the teacher failed all of his kids as they showed ""no creativity"". If his students were able to design their own projects, then creativity would have been present. On another case, my friend and I were given a summer assignment where we had to respond to a prompt that the teacher had given. The prompt was boring and every student wrote similar essays and lacked major creativity according to the head of the English department. We were barely given enough time to write our essays as the prompt had come out late. If the groups were able to chose their own prompts, the kids would be able to put more effort to make a creative, persuasive essay and be given ample time to write them.

Another reason as to why summer project should be student-designed is behind the comprehensibility of the concept. Students will be able to show what they know and understand instead of letting the teacher decide what they should know or understand. Teachers like to know what their upcoming students understand about the subject via their projects. It was difficult for my teacher to grasp what the students knew as he had put out one parallel structure and everyone followed one same principle. If the students were able to design their own projects, they would be able to show more of what they know. Another example is where my friends math teacher had let them design their own projects and make up problems and solve them. Each student had turned in something unique and were able to show the teacher what they knew while having enough time to finish as they were able to work around their vacations.

One may say that if these projects are teacher-designed, there will be one organized structure. As this may seem true, teachers aren't able to get proper data on what the student knows and how creative a student can get. Teachers need to know what their students are capable of doing and if they can't gather the proper data, then they won't know. One may even say that if the projects are teacher-designed it would be easier for the teacher to grade. If that's true, then if projects are student-designed it would be easier for the students to do them. The quality would be better and students would be able to create a project around the free time they have as they have pre-planned vacations and events.

Thus, summer projects should be student-designed to show the creativity of the student, diversity of the projects, and comprehensibility of the concept the students can grasp. Families have planned vacations for the summer over a year in advance, and teachers shouldn't throw the obstacle of following a strict guideline for a summer project and ruin their vacation. If the student is able to design their project, then they can get creative, show their knowledge, and have the time to make a project while enjoying their vacation.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
AA52EF531B30,"For as long as I can remember, my parents always stressed the importance of education.

They always checked in on me while I was studying during the weekends to tell me I was doing a good job and praised me for my work ethic whenever I brought home exceptional grades. After the 9 months of working hard to complete homework assignments, projects, quizzes and tests, I was ecstatic to see the summer time finally arrive. I could not wait to let my skin soak up the sunlight, go on adventures with my friends, and be completely, unapolagetically lazy. One year, I remember telling my father how I was happy that I could take a break from learning and doing homework. He responded with a statement that I always keep in mind. Smiling earnestly he said ""My dear, you should never want to stop learning, no matter where you are or what you are doing, there is always a chance to learn something and benefit from it"" Hearing that, I reflected on my performance during the school year and realized that the more I learned, the better my grades were. I also realized that having a better understanding of the material I was taught helped me to succeed. During the summer time, If I completely slacked off, getting back into the habit of doing school work was difficult for me due to the fact that I disregarded all the information I learned and did not retain much. When my father saw this, he started giving me little assignments to do to prepare me for the next year. These assignment truly helped me prepare for the upcoming academic year and I was able to maintain the habit of doing school work while going over material I learned. Some schools require their pupils to complete summer projects during their break in order to make sure they keep learning even when they are not in the classroom. These projects are important because they enable students to not only retain information, but to also keep them from falling behind when school reopens. I feel as though these projects should be student designed based on a certain rubric so that the students can actively test their knowledge, while they are doing something they are interested in.

Some may argue that these student-designed projects will not be successful because students cannot discipline themselves enough to design and complete their own projects. Or, that they will not learn anything from these projects and they will view this as another task they will half-heartedly complete to get out of the way. What these people fail to realize is that when students are given the opportunity to do something on their own based on something they are interested in they will enjoy working on it more. Throughout the school year they have been given teacher-designed assignments and told exactly what to do. Therefore, having a teacher-designed project wouldnt be as thrilling. It would simply feel like another assignment which they have to complete and then forget about as they enjoy the rest of their summer. In the real world, teachers and authority figures will not always be there to hold the students hand and tell them exactly what to do. These student-designed assignments would give them a sense of responsibility and independence which are crucial factors that are needed in the adult world. Once they have completed these projects, the students will feel a sense of pride knowing they created something unique, all on their own. They can use their creativity to bring these projects to life, while learning more about the topic they have chosen.

Another way these projects will benefit students, is that they will enable them to continue learning even while school is not in session. As they take the time to do research, and design the structure of these projects the students will be actively testing their reading and writing skills, while stimulating their minds as they work on finishing these projects. When they return to school, working diligently to do schoolwork will not be such a draining, difficult task since they were working during the summer time. These projects will keep students from getting lazy which is what tends to happen during the summer time. They toss their books to the side and do not realize how harmful it is to go a full 3 months without doing some kind of schoolwork. Students should not be to struggling at the beginning of each year to remember material from the previous year, or in learning new curriculum. Giving them something to keep their mind running will be beneficial to them as it aids them in continuing their education even when there is not a teacher in front of them.

Therefore, these projects should be student-designed so that students can understand that they should not allow themselves to lose all of the information they learned throughout the school year while they are enjoying their summer break. If they are given assignments of their choosing they can design it in any way that pleases them, while they teach themselves to continue working hard. It is important for students to realize that these projects are not meant to prevent them from enjoying their time away from school. Yes, breaks are important and students should not be doing heaps of schoolwork for hours during their vacation. However, retaining their knowledge of curriculum and maintaining good work ethic is equally as important. The purpose of these projects are to help students, not hurt them. They will show students that they do not need to be solely dependent on teachers to learn, they can teach and help themselves while doing an assignment that interests them.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
206B99189A87,"Should summer projects be teacher designed or student designed? Various schools require students to complete summer projects to ensure they continue learning during their break. Some people may say, summer projects should be students designed, because students will be interested in their summer project. However they are wrong, summer projects should be teacher designed, because the project can help the student learn new things for the class they are taking next year and the projects will be easier for the teacher to grade.

Summer projects should be teacher designed because projects can help teach the students new things that will be needed for the class they take next year and the projects submitted will be easier for the teacher to grade. Teacher designed projects can help students in learning new things for the next material they will learn in the next school year. Over the summer, students become lazy and may forget old material taught in school. When preparing for the next school year, the teacher designed summer project can help them understand what they need to know in the class next year and teach them new things about the subject. If they are taught new things in the project, this will help the students be prepared for the class they take next year and help the teacher not go over certain material taught in the project.

Consequently, when entering into the school years teachers are overwhelmed by work and do not get a lot of time to grade papers and projects. Therefore, if summer projects are teacher designed it will be easier for the teacher to grade the project. This may decrease the amount of workload the teacher has when grading projects. Teacher designed summer projects will be easier for teachers to grade, since the teacher will follow a certain criteria. They can grade the student based on if the student completed all the required components of what the directions of the project stated. Student designed projects will vary among students, since many of the students will pick different topics. However, teacher designed projects can be a specific project that has a specific standard to accomplish. These standards may include having a certain part of the project have a certain variable or having a part of the project be written in a certain manner. Since the summer project has a specific components the students needs to meet, the teachers do not have to waste time critiquing projects, because the are looking for something specific, thus decreasing their overall workload. Some people say that summer projects should be student designed, because the student can express and introduce themselves in their project.

Clearly, they are wrong summer projects should be teacher designed. Summer projects that are teacher designed can help the student prepare for the class they take next year and the project can help teach them new things. In addition, teacher designed summer projects will make it easier for the teachers to grade the projects and help decrease the workload for the teacher. In conclusion, summer projects should be teacher designed, this will make the project easier to grade for teachers, decreases the teacher's workload, and will help prepare students for the next school year. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
4E928B4EBC53,"Learning is a life-long process. Even as an adult, learning doesn't stop after leaving college. Humans learn new things every day, and learning is what keeps our society moving forward; it's how technology and medicine continue to improve year after year. But a crucial time period in one's life is the young adult years, where new information is constantly being learned, especially in school. Students are in school for most of the year, but for about 3 months during the summer, the farthest thing from students' minds is learning.

This is understandable, as summer break is a time period for relaxation, to celebrate completing a year of school and take a break before preparing for the next one. But when students haven't done a single Algebra problem the whole summer, or even picked up a book, it can become problematic for teachers when students walk in the first day not knowing the basics required for their class.

That's where summer projects come in. They're a good way to keep students from forgetting all of the basics they must know, or to introduce them to a new class before the actual school year starts.

They're good in theory, but the reality is that most kids don't do these projects. They'll recieve the assigment and think to themselves,

""

I have the entire summer to finish this, so I'll just forget about it until it's closer to the new school year""

Then July rolls around. Project sits unfinished. August arrives, and the project hasn't been touched once. Then, a week before school starts, the student remembers they have a project due, so they scamble to finish it, meaning it's sloppy and rushed. This cycle doesn't apply to all students, but the vast majority fall victim to it.

So how can teachers get students to not finish their summer projects last minute? By letting their students design their summer projects, it will incentivize them to take advantage of the time they have over the summer and do a good, thorough job on them.

For the most part, students enjoy having more freedom on a project or assignment. They aren't restricted by the teacher's requirements, and because they're most likely working on something they enjoy, they'll have more fun in the process. This same principle applies to summer projects. If students get more freedom with what they can do, they'll end up actually wanting to work on it on time because they chose something that interests them.

Taking it a step further, self-designing a project is the perfect way for students to work hard on the project. Say a student is taking a history class, and the class requires a summer project of the student's choosing. The student enjoys learning about World War 2, so they research and find a living war veteran. They set up an interview with them and write a report on the veteran's experience and what it was like to talk to someone who lived during that time.

With this example, the student is continuing to learn because they're gaining knowledge about history from a direct source, but also enjoying themselves because they were already interested in World War 2. This balance of learning and having fun while doing so is the perfect recipe for a successful summer assigment, and it could only be achieved through having students self-design their projects. A teacher cannot assign a project that would pique everyone's interests and make it a learning experience, since they don't know what every individual student is interested in.

Student-designed summer projects can even be satisfying for subjects that students aren't terribly interested in if they make it fun for themselves. If a student doesn't really care for math, but loves learning about the enviornment, they could try to find geometric patterns or shapes that naturally occur in nature. This merging of subjects is incredibly beneficial, since not only are students having fun with their project, but they're potentially learning more about two different subjects, in this case, geometry and the enviornment.

What's best about a student-designed project is that they aren't limited to writing, or completing some sort of packet of material as most teachers assign. These packets are tedious and border on being busy work, as most students see them as being there to be completed and turned in for the points. If a student designs their project themselves, they're able to learn the information though real-world application, and present/compile it in the way that makes most sense to them. That could be through writing, making a presenation board, or even through video or song.

Of course, giving students complete freedom isn't realistic either. Students could get their project idea approved, and a teacher could guide them in the right direction if their project is rejected. They could also collaborate with other students and combine their ideas, or do a joint project. There are limitless possibilities that all allow for students to flex their creative muscles, and with some guidelines in place, student-designed summer projects won't be thrown together at the last minute.

In all, although there are pros and cons to both teacher-designed and student-designed projects, student-designed projects allow for more creative freedom, learning possibilites, and projects not being rushed, but instead carefully crafted and researched. They would make for a more thorough and complete learning experience, and possibly help students realize that leaning can be very enjoyable if done in a way that satisfies their individual learning style and their personal interests and hobbies. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
2080B945CF87,"Some schools want students to continue their education outside of school so that the students will be prepared for the following school year and so that the teachers won't have to spend their class time reteaching a certain subject. But the summer projects that schools give to their students are more then likely made by teachers making those projects not fun and boring. Students should be the ones make the projects because they lose some of their summer do to working on the teacher's project. If the students were to make these summer projects they will be fun, not as time consuming, and not difficult.

Summer projects should be fun for the students so that they will actually learn and remember what the project was actually about over the summer break. So if a student make their own project they will try to make as fun as possible for themselves for their summer break and the project won't make their summer boring. If a student has a project in a science class the student could make a project about wildlife and the could keep track of all the different animals they seen over their summer. Another class that a student should make their own project in is history because the student could write down all the historical buildings and places that they seen over the summer break while traveling. The summer is a time for students to relax and stop worrying about school and homework but if a school decides to give out a summer projects the students should be allowed to make it as fun as they want it to be for themselves.

Next a summer project should not be extremely time consuming so the students will actually have time to enjoy their break from school. If teachers were to make a summer project it would take all summer but if a student was to make a project it wouldn't be very long. Most students will travel throughout their summer break so a long summer project will stop them from traveling as much as possible but if the project was shorter they could travel more and experience life to the fullest. If a English teacher was to make a summer project it may require a students to read 15 books over their break, but if a student make that project for English they could lower that amount to 4 book meaning the have more time to have more fun and not sit around reading all the time. The summer is about fun and not school work so if a school decides to make a summer project the student should be the one who decides how long it should take and not the teachers.

Finally a schools project should never be difficult because summer is supposed to a stress free time and the time for students to relax. If a project is too difficult a student will not want to do it at all and so they will not understand anything when they go over said project the following year, but if a student was to make the project it be easy so they will actually want to do it over their break and understand what may happen that following year. If a student is make their own project they will make it easy so that they will have no issue working on the project over the break and will get a good grade the following year on said project. If a math teacher was to give a summer project that makes students work out a big packet with a ton of questions in it a student will never finish it and they will receive a bad grade, but if a student was to make the packet it would shorter and a whole lot easier for themselves not requiring the student to struggle over their break. The more difficult a summer project is the student will never learn from it but if a student was to make their own it wouldn't be difficult and they would continue to learn over their summer break.

In conclusion a student should be allowed to make their own summer projects because teachers make everything more difficult then possibly needed. A summer project needs to be fun, easy, and short so a student can enjoy their summer to the fullest and still come back to school the next year ready to learn. So if a student make their summer project they will fufill the school by still learning and still having a great summer.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
278800A79148,"Some schools require students to complete projects over the summer. These projects help to prepare students for the next year as well as help the retain the information from past years. Who is the best person to design these projects? The teacher, of course. Summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers know how to prepare the students for the next year, they can adjust the difficulty level, and it's an opportunity to get the students used to the specific teaching style of the teacher they're going to have.

First, teachers know what's going to be on the curriculum, so the know how to best prepare students for the coming year. For example, if a student were to design their own project, they wouldn't know what to study, because they have yet to learn the material. Teachers, however, know exactly what to put in the project to help them prepare, and they can also incorporate material from the students' previous years so they won't forget it as easily. The teachers are also trained to teach, so they would be the best at designing these projects.

Some may say that students should design their own summer projects because they can adjust the difficulty level to suit themselves. The optimal level of difficulty varies among everyone, so they shouldn't all get the same project because it might be too easy for some, and too difficult for others. To negate the first statement, students are too likely to not do a project at all over the summer with an excuse such as, ""not needing to do a project because they're sure they can remember everything from the last year,"" or because ""they're a fast learner and can learn the new material quickly."" Some may even decide that their fun summer takes priority above all learning. If the teacher designs the project, then the teacher can make sure that everyone does a project so everyone will be able to excel in the coming years. To address the varying level of optimal difficulty level issue, There are AP, honors, and regular classes for this reason, and if, for any reason, the project is too hard or too easy, the student can talk to the teacher about that issue. All in all, it is best if the teacher designs the projects.

Lastly, it's an opportunity to get the students used to the specific teaching style of the teacher they're going to have. This greatly benefits the student, because studies show that people learn more and retain information longer when they're in a comfortable environment. Summer projects are a great way to make that first step into the school year and get the students familiar with a certain teaching style.

To sum it all up, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they know the curriculum and can best prepare students for the next school year, they can adjust the difficulty of the project to challenge students, and it gives their new students an opportunity to become familiar with their teaching style. Summer projects are popularly viewed in a negative fashion, but these projects serve a very important use. They help students prepare for what's to come. Think about how many students are struggling to keep up with their classes, because they didn't do a summer project",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
41ADEA51A15E,"While some people say that summer projects that are assigned over the summer should be created by teachers, it should be created by students, because it allows for students to: connect better with others, create better quality work, and allow for better planning for student schedules over the summer. These can benifit the sutendent more then having a teacher plan the projects.

The first reason for projects to be created by students is that it allows for better connections in topics. Students can create topic ideas or structures, that best fit the students needs and allows them to connect or create friendships through these topics. For example, when I had a group science project the teacher allowed for the groups to choose their own topic, this allowed for collaboration and more connectivity. Connectivity can be importent for people over the summer because it makes a project that they dont want to do a lttle more fun. This can create frindships and bonds with people.

The next reason is that it allows for students to make better work. Students can pick a topic that interests themselfs or other students, and this allows for more focus on the topic. For example, when I go looking for a job I look for a few things, benifit to me and if it fits my intrests. If I were to have a job that I find is boring and that I dont find intresting then I will not preform as effectively. This is the same with so many other people and it can perfectly translate in to doing projects which allows for more productive and well thought out work.

The final reason for students-designed projects is better time management. As a student over summer the last thing that you want to do is to do school projects outside of school. With these students-designed projects it allows for students to plan how their fellow students or even how they themself will spend their summer. One example, is that as a student, I can relate to how other students will spend their time and I can plan according to how I or others will spend their time. This can allow for better work from those students as it might not interfere with other things over the summer.

While some might say that, teachers can allow for a more rigorous and better structure for learning, it is more benifitial towards learning to allow students to pick the topics that interest them. It can allow for more productivity and better work quality.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
758703E5BF73,"Summer break is a crucial time needed to ease tensions from the stressful life of a student. The responsibility of designing a project that is forced upon students during their time off should be held by teachers.

When it comes to summer activities, completing a school project isn't one that comes to mind. If students are being required to do a project, then teachers should be the ones to design it. Creating projects and lesson plans, assigning work, etc. is all apart of a teacher's job. As employees of schools that require a summer project, teachers, rather than students, should be in control of the project elements. Doing this will give teachers the opportunity to have say in what their students are learning.

Along with it being apart of their job description, teachers should be designing projects because this will motivate students to put forth their best work. For most students, the end result of completing their work is more important than the process of doing it. They will go above and beyond to get the correct answer, but wouldn't do the same in order to understand why that answer is correct. If the project is teacher-designed, then students will have a standard to meet and will strive to meet it. However, having a student-designed project will create lower standards and decrease the motivation needed to complete the project.

Being forced to complete a task, especially during a time intended for relaxation, will only result in sloppy work being done. Although the project is intended for the continuation of learning, students are more likely to design their projects to be as simple as possible. Given the circumstance of it being summer and having to complete a project which is under their observation, students will do the bare minimum amount of work. The same cannot be said if it was created by a teacher. In addition, students are more likely to complete the project solely for the grade rather than the learning experience; defeating the whole purpose of assigning a summer project.

The burden of having an entire project to do over the course of summer is the last thing students want. This task is forced upon them by their schools. Therefore, educators should be accounted for having a well designed project to assign to students. The students already have extra, unwanted work to complete. They shouldn't have to be given the additional stress of having to design their own projects.           ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
246A0E00FE73,"Summer projects are never fun, whether they are made by students or a teacher, at the end of the day, it takes away time of a students summer. The summer is a time for students and teachers to relax, but students often forget most of the information they learned during that past school year.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed because students may make the assignments too easy and put in no effort, teachers can give the assignment based on what they learned and what they need to know for the following year and, the teachers will be able to grade it faster and will help get a better understanding about which students are struggling in what areas of the subject.

When making a student create a project or assignment, most students are going to make it as easy as possible with no real challenge. There are some that will make it challenging and beneficial, but others won't try and will get no information out of it. If the teacher makes the assignment, they can put the right information that they need to know for the assignment and really challenge the students to actually think about what they are doing. The teacher doesn't have to make it super difficult but find a balance of challenging and able to do. The assignment may take a long time to do but it will help prepare the students.

Sometimes when students get extra help from a tutor or an online program, they get information that they don't need to know and then they study that information. With teacher-designed assignments they can give the students the right information so they know the exact information they need to. While the teacher could just give the student a rubric, the teacher can give specific examples and further information to the students. When the teacher creates the assignment they can also give information and examples that are used in the following year that they will need to know. Getting a head start on information needed for the following year will benefit students a lot, because if they go get extra help they will be ready for the class and know some of the material already.

If the students make the assignment the teacher will have to dig through and try to find all of the information they asked for, but if they make it themselves, all they have to do is check for the parts in the place they are supposed to be at. Lots and lots of teachers always complain about the massive pile of papers they need to grade, but all they have to do is put the information and example in one place and they can just check it off. Also while doing this, the teacher can easily see where the students are struggling and how exactly to help them. Sometimes teachers struggle to find ways to help struggling students because it could be the way the teacher is explaining it or the student just doesnt understand the material. The faster teachers are able to grade the assignments the faster they can help the students because if the assignment isn't graded and it's been too long, the student will be even more lost than before.

Teachers will have the final decision and will choose what they think will help the students learn the most. Some may say that the summer assignments should be student-designed, however, the teacher designed assignments will get the exact information to the student.

71DCB7BFA985,"In today's educational system for students across the country most students have a three month summer break at the end of the year.

While this is full of fun and vacations, some schools also assign summer projects for the students to complete over their break.

Most of the time however, the students are given the projects by teachers with little to no choice on the project.

The era of students not having their own voice and not being able to design these summer projects needs to come to an end.

Students should be able to design their own summer projects because it would provide a wider range of options for the students, students would put more time and effort into their project, and the students will not actually feel like they are doing a project.

Students not being allowed to design their own summer projects really limits them and their abilities.

The students are not able to branch out and be creative towards their own project, but instead must follow a base format that the teacher designed for them.

Students having the privilege to design their own summer projects will provide them a wider range of options to choose from, like a sport they enjoy, and allow them to be more creative.

The students can design a project around themselves they feel they can complete and succeed on.

This would prove much better than a student trying to complete a teacher designed project in which the students may not even know what to do for the project.

Student designed summer project would prove better in the long run because the students can express themselves and design a project they feel passionate about.

Teachers today finds at times that when a student turns in a project they were assigned over the summer it appears to have no effort put towards it, and it was completed last minute.

Most of the time this is because the teachers designed the projects and the students did not really care for it.

If students were able to design their own summer projects teachers would see more effort and time put into these projects by the students.

Students would feel more motivated and put towards more effort in a project they were able to design which would bring them a better sense of accomplishment.

A project designed by themselves would excite the students more and students would feel more inspired to do their best on it thus providing a much better product for the teachers to evaluate.

Some may argue today that teachers should keep designing these summer projects for the students because they are the teachers.

Some individuals argue that students should accept the assignment and complete it because it is their job to do so.

In fact however, if students were able to design their own project they may not even feel like they are doing a project.

Given the freedom students would have access to when designing their own project, the students may not even look upon it as a project but more as just an activity they are doing through the summer.

Students would be able to design whatever project they want and if they design a project they enjoy doing, then they will not feel like they are dreading on the project throughout the summer.

This would be the opposite if a teacher were to design the projects for students thus students would feel like they are working on a project and dread upon it the whole summer break.

Students today do not have the freedom they deserve when it comes to projects, especially summer ones.

Students should be able to design their own projects for the summer because it is their summer and not the teacher's.

Allowing the students to design their own projects would provide students a wider range of options for the project, students would put more time and effort into their project, and the students will not actually feel like they are doing a project.

Teachers should allow the students to design their own projects also because it would be interesting for the teachers as well to see what some students may create.

When September rolls around the students should be able to look back on their summer and not feel as if they were forced to do a project they did not enjoy, and the teachers should be able to assess these as well and feel the same.  ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
3A87EAAFBEA0,"If theres one thing that can ruin a kids summer vacation, its a long and boring summer assignment given out by their teachers. Teachers think they are helping by making the assignment hard to get the kids thinking, but in reality, most kids will just give up and not do it. I think that summer assignments should be created by the students because they would be better suited for the kids, more kids would do them, and they would make the project less boring.

First of all, I think summer assignments should be created by the students because they know what they have learned, and what they still need help with. For example, if each student got to pick what they wanted their math assignment to be about, they could choose a topic in which they struggled so they could grasp a more firm understanding over the summer. This would be more beneficial than if the teacher made the assignment because it is specifically detailed to suit each individual student. The kids would be able to spend their time working on material that would help them, and not on stuff they already know.

Secondly, I think more kids would complete the summer assignment if they had a say about what it was on. An example in which this would work would be for an English essay assignment. If each student got to choose what the topic of their essay or project was, then they would be more interested and more inclined to complete the work. Every student is passionate about something, whether it be football or world history, so an assignment about something you enjoy would be much more compelling to do than an assignment on something you have no interest in.

Lastly, a student made summer project would be more interesting and less boring than one created by a teacher. Students know what is trendy and what is not, so even if they have to make the assignment meet certain requirements, they could make the topics about more popular stuff to make the assignment more interesting. For example, even if they are tasked with making a math assignment less boring, they could just put the same numbers in a question about something that is popular with youth. From experience I can say that even just making math questions about something relevant can make an assignment so much better and less excruciating to complete.

There is not a single student who really enjoys completing a summer assignment given to them by their school. Summer assignments are boring and take up precious time that could be spent outside, so one thing that could make them a little less horrible would be if they were made or edited by yourself or someone if your shoes. An assignment created by students would benefit the students more, be more interesting, and create a higher completion percentage than an assignment that a teacher made.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

It might be more interesting to let a student design the summer assignments. Students know what other students like, how we like to learn. A student would assign something that othe students will enjoy doing. Being a student and a teenager they would know that students love phones and technology, so they wouuld find something like making video documentaries or maybe some type of progressive learning app.

If a student were designing a summer assignment it might also be easier to comprenhend and complete. I've never liked or completed my summer assignments because they were always too long and hard to even try to complete. A student would know how it feels and make something easy to do while also educating us. Like assigning

No Red Ink to complete: while a teacher is going to give you a 1,000 page essay.

In conclusion, it would definitley be a more effecient way of learning over the summer if they were to let a student design the assignment.

Students will get their project done quicker if they know they don't have to do a lot of other tasks. Summer reading projects should be student-designed because students know the expectations already, it will insure that they will complete the assignment, and students can have freedom and choice when it comes to their project.

First of all, summer reading projects should be student-designed because the students should already know the expectations from their teachers from past projects. For example, one summer i was doing my summer reading project and realized how little expectations the teachers have for us, students. I then outdid my work astronomically by achieving an 100 percent on the grade. I quickly realized that because i went above and beyond on this project that the teachers wouldn't have cared about what book i read or wrote about. I believe that teachers have low expectations for students and that students actually have high expectations for themselves. When students are able to set their own expectations they can do extraordinary things; that goes for anything. Another example of this is when football players or even soccer players go to games. They always have the mindset of expecting the best but preparing for the worst. In this case with something as easy as a summer reading project you can always expect the best from yourself; especially if they are designed by students for students.

Second of all, summer reading should be student-designed because it will insure that they complete the assignment. Almost always when a teacher gives out an assignment students dread doing it because they feel like they have to do it to succeed. This is not the case, students should not feel like they're being forced to do an assignment the assignment should be fun, yet still have good key points. For example, one summer i absolutely dreaded doing my summer reading project. I dreaded doing the assignment because it wasn't any fun like it should be; it was literally a essay. I remember thinking ""Oh great i have to do essays during the school year and during summer"". I thought this because it is really boring to do essays all the time, and any student can vouch on that. I also was thinking this because the essay had to be about a book from the list given out. Which brings me to my next point.

Lastly, if students are able to design their own summer reading projects then they can choose whatever book they want and they can choose what kind of assignment they do. I think this is a good method because not all students read the same kind of book genres; i personally like horror, thriller and action. Someone else could like fantasy and mythic books. Everyone has different interests and everyone has different dislikes. Someone that likes non-fiction could just absolutely hate fiction. Another good reason is that students wont be stuck doing boring essays all the time, in fact they could do an interview, a poster, or even a brochure trying to persuade people to read the book while still giving a great amount of information about the book.

In conclusion, summer reading projects should be student-designed because students know the expectations already, it will insure that they will complete the assignment, and students can have freedom and choice when it comes to their project. Many students don't do their summer reading because it takes too much time and is too complicated. Those students who do their summer reading never get a major grade for it like they should. Students will get their project done quicker if they know they don't have to do a lot of other tasks. Contact your local school board and get them to make summer reading fun!!",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
B092EE6E6C3B,"Students should be able to design their own Summer Projects. Students had to do the work teachers assigned for them all school year. Schools want students to do Summer Projects than they should at least make it an student-design project. Students don't want to worry about a project all Summer. Therefore, students should be able to design their own project.

Students had to do the work that teachers design all school year. The least they can do is make a project that the students would prefer. Students don't always want to do boring projects. They would like to change it up from being boring. Just give the students a chance and you'll agree.

Schools want students to do Summer Projects than it should be student-designed. It would give the students to think of the box instead of doing going by he directions. Especially, since its their break out of school; you can't take their Summer away by worrying about an Summer Project. The students would prefer to get school off their mind. They like to: chill, sleep in, and be out with their friends. That's how Summer should be for them.

An teacher-designed wouldn't be bad for a Summer Project. Teachers could be able to grade easier since they designed the project. The school doesn't care who designs the projects; they just want to make sure they keep the students learning. Student-desgined would be preferable for a Summer Project, it'll be different from previous projects.

The students should design their own Summer projects. Teachers been assigning and designing the work and projects all school year. Students would rather be able to design their own projects. Teachers would design a long Summer Project, the students want a project they can finish in a week. The schools need to consider the thought of making the students design their own projects, it'll be creative.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
98EB307EB4CC,"Many schools made the smart decision of requiring a summer project to make sure that their students are learning over a long break, as students who do not exercise their brain over the summer are known to have less knowledge when returning from the break. If schools started giving out the option of students being able to design these projects instead of the teachers, the beneficial aspects of the summer project would start to dissipate. This is because most students will not push themselves to learn, teachers know how much work a student can handle, and teachers know what the student is supposed to learn to prepare for the coming year. Thus, teachers should design the summer projects instead of students, as they know what the student would benefit from.

Summer is known to be a time to have fun, relax, and be stress-free. Most television shows, movies, books, or any forms of media about summer do not talk about the importance of learning over the long break. As students in this generation are heavily influenced by the media, they do not think about school over the summer and believe that it is just a time to relax. If the task of designing a project is given to a student of this mindset, which is mostly every student these days, they will design a project that does not require much effort to complete. Their project will not challenge them in any way, and will consequently not exercise their brain properly. Thus, students should not be given the option to design their own summer project, as they will not learn as much as they should.

For twelfth grade and below, states give teachers a list of learning targets, based on their grade and subject(s), that they must cover over the course of the school year. The teachers are already familiar with those targets as they have spent years learning them. That is how teachers understand their subject and it is their job to help their students understand it over the course of the school year, which is why students are not excpected to teach themselves the learning targets for their coming classes over summer break. Thus, when teachers make the projects, they know how much of the syllabus and how many things from the last school year to incorporate. After completing the project designed by teachers, students will have the right amount of background knowledgeneeded to feel prepared for thecoming year. In conclusion, teachers should create the summer project as they know what to teach to the students in order to prepare them for the next school year.

A teacher's job is to teach a syllabus to their students over a given period of time. In order to do this, teachers must have a understanding in how much work to give to a student so that they would understand the concept and not feel overwhelmed doing so. In most cases, teachers have years of experience that help them understand the capabilities of student. In the other cases, the new teachers had to earn their college degree by knowing how much work a student can and should handle. Either way, teachers truly understand how much work to give to their students so that they can benefit from it. Thus, teachers should design the summer projects as they know how much work a student can handle

In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by teachers and not students. While some say that students should design the projects as they know what they can handle, teachers have a degree in knowing what a student can handle. Also, teachers know what to teach to the students to prepare them for the coming year, and most students will not push themselves hard enough while making the project. Thus, teachers should design the summer projects as they truly know what the student would benefit from.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
66435002F527,"Summer projects are one way that teachers can have their student prepare for the next school year. While some students might dislike the idea of doing projects over the summer they are necessray for academic improvement. One way to increase the learning done for these projects is to have them student designed. Having student designed projects will ensure that the student will enjoy the project, increase the chance that the student will complete the project, and produce a higher quality of work.

By allowing students to design the project you ensure that they enjoy the area of study. Students who do not like history should not be forced to complete project on the history of their town. The same is true with a student who doesn't like math. I personally have expierenced this through my work in the VASTS program. The program is an NASA run organization that has allowed me to study the areas of subject that I enjoy. When a student enjoys an area of subject they are more likely to study and work hard. This is important because the summer is suppossed to be a break from school, and having student designed project will make the work feel like less of a task. If the student does not like what they are studying the work will not be done.

Allowing the student to select his or her own project will lead to higher completion rates. Universtiy studies show that when a student enjoys an aera of study they are more likely to work hard and complete the assignment on time. This is important because over the summer there are no teachers to hold students accountable. Without pushing from teachers it is important to ensure that the students push themselves. While teachers can check on student progess during the school day, this is impossible over the summer. Teachers can send emails, but students can simply delete te emails as they come in. If the student enjoys the topic they selected then they will feel self motivated to complete the project.

Allowing the student to be motivated by a self selected project will make the work seem easier and produce a higher quality of work. When a student already knows more about a topic it makes it easier to create a project. This is imporant because a long and hard project will make the student feel less motivated. Leading the student to rush through the project the week before the start of school. However, a project that the student selected will motivate them. A motivated student is more likely to create a good project and work throughout the summer instead of just the week before the project is due.

Although some teachers might argue that students will come to school with different levels of knowledge because they select their own topics, this problem can be quickly solved. Instead of beginning the year with lectures and worksheets teachers could allow the students to share there projects with one another. Several schools are beginning to shift the the self teach and then share model. This model allows students to craft their own views and then share with the class. This would allow for students to not only learn but also get to know each other. Something that modern schools say is important for class disscussions. After the projects have been shared the teacher can go take a class and go over what facts the students might have missed.

The fact that students will enjoy what they are working on, be more likely to complete the project, and produce a higher quality of work make it evident that if summer projects are assigned they must be student designed. Over the summer students do not want to work and a student designed proect will help motivate the students to complete the project. The concerns of students entering the school year with varied amounts of knowledge is something that is quickly resolved by having students share their projects with on another.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9BF316100BDC,"Some schools require summer projects for students. Just to assure students are to continue learning through out their summer break. Many argue if the summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. The schools that require summer projects should have their projects be teacher-designed for many various reasons.

Although many others think that the summer projects should be student-designed. Those would think that since it's a project to do over the summer;many students should have a say. Their own choice to choose what should be done for their project and how it should be done. That would be giving them the opportunity for them to do something and be able to start from the beginning with it. Though with it being student-deigned it would bring many problems.

The teachers would give the students an objective or task for the project. They would have to know what the objective is to know what is needed to be learned for this summer project. The student can be specified to knowing what could be done once knowing the objective of the project. Once the objective is giving to them they get a better understanding and knowledge of what is need to learn for their summer project.

Then teachers would also give many sorts of examples to the students. Giving the students examples of the project will help them get a better understanding of how it should be done. Once the students gets a better knowledge of what do to for their project when examples are given to them. Examples given to the students should have them thinking how they should start their summer project and start to wonder what it should be based off.

Lastly the teacher would tell them what is required or needed for their summer project. The whole point of a summer project is to assure students continue their learning over break. The teachers could give the students a requirement that has them learn many things that can be presented in their summer projects. That would be assuring that students continue learning during their summer break. The teachers would be able to know if they learned something over their summer break.

In conclusion, summer school projects should be teacher-designed. The students are given requirements, objectives and examples for the project by the teachers. With the requirements and objectives students can start to begin their projects with an understanding of what is needed to learn. Students would still get a say in what they would like to do for their summer project though. It wouldn't be as freely to say the project is student-designed. Having the summer projects teacher-designed would make it easier for many students as well.                                        ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

Public school years are designed to give teachers and students two months off as a summer vacation. Many do not like this format. They think students forget too much of the material they learned over the school year. To combat this, schools are starting to introduce summer projects. These projects are designed to maintain the levels of education students have received. However, schools are having trouble introducing these projects. They can not decide who should be able to design them. Some think teachers should, while others believe students should. Students should design their projects in order for them to get the most educational value out of the assignment.

Summer is a time for students to sleep in and be care free. Many do not like the idea of completing a summer project. They think that their freedom is being taken away. Allowing students to design their project will increase their motivation. Most of the time, they will have chosen a topic that interests them. The project will not be put off until the end of summer. Being interested in a subject sparks a need to learn more. They will constantly want to learn more about the subject matter. Each new fact will increase the complexity of the project. The knowledge gained from excess research will provide a basis for their next year in school.

A student that voluntarily researches has more than just motivation. They have a thirst for knowledge. This thirst will motivate them to put more effort into their projects. The effort they put in will help to create a substantial project. The knowledge they gain will not disappear. It will be engraved in their brains for years to come. Each project will help them to learn time management skills and organization strategies as well. These skills will help students grow as individuals. They will help students be successful in college and in their lives after school.

Sometimes students are busy. Those that are involved in sports and clubs, and might not have a lot of time to complete a summer project. In this case, they can choose a project similar to a classmate. The two students will be able to make the project easier to complete. They are able to coordinate with each other, and split up responsibilities. They will have to do two separate projects, but the work will not be as hard. They will also learn how to work together as a team. Learning how to share responsibilities and be a team player will also help them in their lives after school. Careers require teamwork skills, hard work, and reliability.

Although letting students have control over their projects would keep them interested and motivated, some worry that the project might not have the right educational value. Letting teachers design the project will ensure the students are getting the right amount of learning. The rubric and content will be specific to certain classes or subjects. Teachers can make sure specific subjects are being covered if they are responsible for creating each project. The projects could also prepare students for upcoming classes. They will learn basic knowledge needed to be prepared for higher level classes. The project could prepare students for the future school year.

Schools that have implemented a summer project are trying to prevent loss of knowledge. During summer, students forget a lot of the knowledge learned from the previous school year. Allowing students to design their summer projects will help reduce this loss of knowledge. They will become more motivated, learn more about the subject they are interested in, and learn valuable life lessons. Letting their teachers design the projects will guarantee educational value, but the students will benefit more from choosing their own. No one wants to be forced to complete something during their free time. Students that choose their own project will not look at it as an assignment, but as a time to learn more. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
39B821028D1A,"When summer break comes by, do teachers first think summer projects or do students? Summer projects are created for students to continue learning during break to ensure that their academic efforts are still working and intact once school comes back around the corner in late august. During the long duration of almost three months, students tend to lose the momentum they had during the school year. which is why summer projects are assigned. But, on who should these summer projects be designed by is up to debate from teachers or students. Summer projects should be teacher-designed, because teachers are more reliable to help us learn, they know how to make efficient and effective projects, and know how to continue student's learning.

Others may be bias and say student-designed summer projects should be used. As it may create less stress and less of a burden throughout the summer, making it not so difficult and easier to finish. So they can enjoy the rest of their summer break without worry. However, this produces a non-effective and inefficient summer project to keep learning over break. If students were to make these summer projects easy his or her brain would not grow and really understand the material to keep himself or herself learning over the break. He or she could easily forget how to properly face situations and find difficulty problem solving questions and/or answers.

Being a teacher is a job, you have to go to college to become one. Teachers are a reliable source of education, as they went to college for the purpose of teaching the knowledge they learned to his or her student's. When in need for help, a friend of mine would not ask his classmates for it. Instead, he would ask his teacher for assistance. A teacher's job is to help you understand what you have trouble understanding in his or her line of work. Because, they know what they are doing and what they are talking about when explaining something a student found troubling. Once a student asked a classmate what equation did this problem ask for, and later to find out it was the wrong equation. therefore making the answer wrong, causing possible confusion for both the students. Since they did not go talk to the teacher, who knows what they are doing. It is not a student's job to help other students, it is a teacher's. Students don't always know a subject as much as his or her teacher does. They may miss a few things out or show a way that they find easier to solve specific problems, but you may not. However, a teacher can provide more than one way of solving a problem. This makes teachers a more reliable and effective source of information and education than students.

When teachers assign projects and homework, it is expected that they have an organized plan to keep the students efficiently and effectively learning. When finishing a unit a teacher assigns a packet, which acts as a study guide for an upcoming test. The packet would include easy questions to complex questions and/or problems to answer as a variety to get used to what you can solve and cannot. This can provide efficient practice because each problem is made from the teacher, making it effective to help prepare you for the test. They know what is best for you as a student. If these summer project student-designed assignments were given to finish, how would you know and trust that this is an effective and efficient source of material? Since students are not as experienced as teachers are. How could a student know his or her project design is helping him or her continue learning over the summer, If students are not deemed to be as reliable as a teacher is.

Teachers have already scheduled everything in the beginning since they need students to learn to continue throughout the year. Teachers have done this for years and know critical parts of the units to be mainly focusing on, so that students over the summer can learn them. When taking a test, teachers prefer adding a cumulative section to re-test students knowledge on previous units. Using important questions and/or problems for students to relearn the material to continue memorizing it. This continues students previous knowledge of learning. Just how in the summer they could use critical parts of each unit to continue students learning over the break. If students attempted to do this, they would use any question and/or problem they seem fit to be answered. But, not realize if it is important enough to use for effectively keeping the student learning.

Summer projects should be designed by teachers, because teachers are a reliable source of education, are experienced enough to make effective and efficient projects, and know how continue a student's learning. Students are to learn as teachers are to teach. It should stay that way, because teachers know what is best for students, they know what works and what does not. They should handle assignments, as it is their jobs to help students understand and continue understanding during their summer break.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
46A92C87B030,"Summer projects are required in some schools so that students can keep learning over their break. I believe these said projects should be designed by the students and not by their teachers. One reason is students should be able to learn what they want. Another reason is the students will most-likely make their project shorter to complete which means more time to enjoy summer break.

Whenever you have a project it's always more exhaustive to complete when you are not passionate about the subject. When you are able to pick and choose the topic of what you learn though, you get inspired and are excited to do the project. I think that it is pertinent for students to have a strong passion for their work, it makes it far more enjoyable to do. For example, in my middle school, I was able to design my own project over the summer, and for the first time I actually had fun working, unlike my teacher made projects. It is highly necessary for the youth to learn attributes and skills they are personally interested in so when they get a job they know what their doing and are not filled with useless knowledge they don't need.

I also think that having a break is warranted if you are working hard, it helps rejuvenate and recollect yourself. Students need breaks and giving them an unnecessarily long project to do over their vacation takes that away from them. Families are also busy over break with traveling and seeing family members. Most of the time students lack the time to really put their best effort into their work. If you let students decide their workload and limit they will have a favorably less stressful summer vacation, giving them the rightful break they deserve.

I strongly believe that all schools that require a summer project should let their students decide what they want to accommodate their knowledge with not the teachers. Still, on the other hand, people might want teachers to create the projects, but students don't usually learn anything valuable to their selves if they aren't interested in the subject. So in conclusion, students should be permitted to mold their own summer break projects. Then at the end of the day, everyone is satisfied and able to learn what they want, letting students enjoy the vacation they are given.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
89BA155355E4,"How can students continue to learn over the summer? Summer break is the longest break of the year for most students, and many students tend to not maintain what they had learned during the school year. Naturally teachers would want their students to continue learning over the break. In order to do so teachers might assign summer projects, that way their students don't stop learning over the 2 month break and are able to maintain what they already learned from the school year. Most summer projects that are teacher-designed bring the stresses of the school year, such as deadlines or requirements, into summer break. That's why these summer projects should be student-designed as it would provide the students with more freedom, an increased interest in what they learn, and less stress over the course of the project.

Having a student-designed summer project would allow for students to feel an increased sense of freedom. If the project were to be student-designed, then the students will feel more free because they'd be able to do their project based off of what they like, which would increase their interest in the subject of their project. With an increased sense of freedom, students will enjoy the project rather than feel as if it was just another assignment they needed to do for school. The feeling of freedom would increase their interest in the subject of their project because students would have the opportunity to design the project on what they like. This means that the students would put in more effort into the project, as they would feel they are doing what they like to do and not what they have to do. The increase in effort means that the quality of the project would be better. This is because the students would have a genuine interest in what they were doing. If summer projects were student-designed, then the students would feel more freedom, which would increase their interest in what they were meant to learn. This would lead to students putting in more effort into their project, which will make the quality of the project better, and they would enjoy the project more.

When students enjoy the project, they tend to stress over it less. Summer break is meant to be a time where students shouldn't have to worry about the stresses of school. It should be a time where the students feel stress free, and free to do what they want. If the students get to decide their own projects, then they would feel less stressed out because the project would be on their own terms. They would get to decide what they wanted, and how they wanted to do it. This would cause less stress because the students would become their own teachers. They would get to learn without having to feel the stressful deadlines or requirements of the teacher-designed assignments they have during the school year. A student-designed summer project is be better for the students themselves because they wouldn't feel the stress that teacher-designed assignments bring during the school year.

Summer break is a time where students get to relax and not worry about the stresses of the school year. The break is meant for students to relax from school, but the majority of students relax too much and end up losing what they learned throughout the school year. The best way to solve this problem would be to assign summer projects that the students could do to maintain what they had learned in the school year, while learning more during the summer. Instead of these projects being teacher-designed, like all the work the students have already done in the school year, the projects should be student-designed. This would lead to students feeling more free, more interested, and less stressed by their projects. They would learn better as the students would genuinely want to do the project, and they wouldn't feel as if they had to do the project. It can be difficult to maintain what you learn from the school year, but if students got to design their own project, they would continue to learn throughout the course of the summer in a healthy, stress-free way.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
C1C86CB5DC8D,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to make sure students review and learn over their summer break. Most of these assignments are teacher-designed, making students complete a project based off the teachers guidelines. Although this can assure teachers that students are learning over the break, it can also add on to the stress of completing a teacher designed assignment, making ideas limited. I think summer assignments should be student-designed because it lets students think and be creative, makes the learning process less stressful, and teachers can see all the different project ideas students can come up with.

Summer assignments would be better off student-designed because of the limitless amount of creativity that the students can use during the process. Students would be able to use every creative idea they can think of when it's student designed, opposed to when it's teacher designed. Teacher-designed projects always have a limit as to how creative a student can be based off their ideas. It limits the amount of creativity by making the same guidelines for every student. If students can create their own project with their own guidelines, they won't have a limit of materials of ideas they can use. Doing this, students can each come up with a new idea that makes the learning process more enjoyable and creative, making the work seem less like a stressful project.

Having students create their own student-designed project will also help students have less amount of stress during their break. Seeing that most summer projects are teacher-designed, it makes the students dread doing their summer work and procrastinate doing the work until the last minute. A way to prevent this is to let students decide what project they want to do, as long as it's creative and helped them learn something over the summer. Doing this can help students think of ideas quickly, which will make the process of starting and finishing the project at a quicker pace. This will prevent less stress and procrastination for students because there are no specific guidelines that are the same for every student, as long as there is a specific due date for the project.

A student-designed project can also let teachers see the different project ideas that their students came up with over the summer. As mentioned before, giving every student the same teacher-designed project can limit the amount of ideas and projects students can come up with. This also effects the amount of different ideas students can give out. Since teacher-designed projects are assigned to every student, a lot of students would have the same projects or ideas and designs, because they were given the same specific teacher-designed guidelines. This can also be prevented if students designed their own project and made their own guidelines that let them use their ideas without a limit. Teachers would able to see what their students learned, with a variety of ideas, and not see the same project from every other student.

Although teacher-designed projects are more organized and favored by teachers themselves, students would be able to be more successful and have a more enjoyable time with their own designed project. This can lead to a variety of creative ideas, less stress over the summer, and let teachers see and grade new creative ideas, as stated above. As long as students keep the due date and base it off something knowledgeable they learned over the summer, I believe students would be more successful with their own designed summer projects. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
2A124200FFBF,"Schools out! Summer time! Summer projects?!? I'm sure that's not what kids think about during their summer break. Being a kid that has had many summer projects I can say from a students point of view that when it's finally summer time I forget about school and summer projects. Summer is time for the brain to take a break from studying, projects, and tests. However, teachers have the job of making sure that we can take a break but not forget all the knowledge retained throughout the whole year. They are in charge of getting us ready for the next year and new knowledge. A students top priority is not worrying about the next year and how to keep their mind ready to retain new information. Summer projects should be designed by teachers because some students are not mature enough, old enough, or knowledgeable enough yet to designed the projects to prepare them for the next year.

Although some high school students are mature enough to know what's best, most aren't. High schoolers range from ages 14-18 and people mature at many different times in life. If I had the decision of designing my summer project I would make it easy so that I had more time to relax rather than do school work. That would not prepare me at all for my next year of schooling. However, if my teacher made the assignment then I would do it the way she asks it to be done. Even though I consider myself more mature than a lot of kids in my school I am still just a kid. I am, however, still mature enough to admit it, the fact that I would design my project easier, because I do want a good education for myself. Teachers designing the projects would benefit the students because most students aren't mature enough yet.

Summer projects that are assigned to elementary and middle school students would need to be designed by their teacher because younger kids don't see the importance at such a young age. I talked a lot about high schoolers but they aren't the only ones getting summer projects assigned to them. I can speak from experience that before I was going into high school I didn't even get why I needed to learn half the stuff they were trying to teach me. I was too unintelligent. This is why I speak to the fact that some students aren't old enough to see the importance of keeping your brain thinking over the summer break.

Students aren't knowledgeable enough yet to know what to put on their school projects. Summer projects are assigned to students by the curriculum of their classes for the next year. Therefore, if a student is put to the task of designing their own summer project for their classes next year they wouldn't have enough knowledge to do the right thing for their project. The teachers would be the most helpful in creating the project for the students to do before school the next year. However, if the teachers made guidelines for the project and what was needed on it then that could work.

All in all, teachers designing the summer projects would be more beneficial towards the students due to students not being mature, old, or in the know enough. Summer projects are more of a priority for teachers than students during summer. Although, they are still needed for the student to prepare for the next year. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8

In order to combat this trend, many schools are starting to assign summer projects to students in order to help them retain information and further their education. However, many people disagree on whether the projects should be designed by the teachers or the students themselves. Some say that students would be able to effectively pursue their own interests while others say teachers' experience would prove to be more effective. Summer projects should be designed by the teachers because of their previous experience in designing projects, their ability to ensure critical information will be retained or learned, and their ability to ensure that all students will receive the same amount of work.

A common argument for students to design their own projects would be that by allowing students this freedom, students would be able to actively pursue the topics and ideas that interest them and this would drive them to work more enthusiastically on their projects. Just as Frederick Douglass fervently pursued his dream of learning to read, these students would also be self motivated to learn about their own interests. However this is incorrect because teachers can design the projects to include all students' interests but do so in a more effective way. Teachers develop a personal bond with students throughout the year. This bond that develops informs the teachers on the students' skills and interests which would allow the teachers to develop the summer projects in such a way as to facilitate eager emotions for learning. This way, the students would still be inspired by their interests to learn while being guided by their teacher to learn everything that they should.

Teachers have valuable experience from their work that allows them to be skilled at designing summer projects. All high school teachers have a collegiate level of education as required by their job. The teachers have years of experience studying the best ways to facilitate learning through all mediums, including projects. Due to this large gap in understanding the intricacies of learning, teachers are extremely more skilled at designing projects than students. In addition, because the projects are meant to facilitate learning and recall, the teachers' understanding of how learning is best achieved allows them insight to the most efficient ways to do this. It is a common saying among athletes that ""practice makes perfect."" This principle can also be applied to other skills such as designing projects. Teachers, through their years of work and experience, have created multitudes of projects. Their experience of creating projects allows them to master the craft to produce quality material. While students have little to no experience creating projects, teachers do. Their superiority in this way allows them to more effectively combat the ""summer slide"" than the students would. Though experience is important, essential information also plays a large role.

Teachers can make sure that essential skills and knowledge will be retained by students to ensure future success. Teachers are required by their school to be familiar with the course and curriculum that they teach. With this knowledge, teachers can implement the essential material into the projects. By doing this, the students remember and learn vital information without even realizing it. Teachers can equip students with knowledge that will prove to be vital later on in their schooling careers. If students designed their own projects, this extra benefit would not be at all possible because of their obvious lack of knowledge that they have yet to learn. One essential skill that is taught by professors to retain information for long periods of time is to review what you have already learned. This memory skill can be hidden within projects by the teachers to cement certain information into students brains. Teachers would be able to strengthen old knowledge while providing new knowledge and skills through their projects. Though knowledge is important, equal opportunity is as well.

Teaches would ensure that all students are given the same amount of work to complete for their projects. Steve Jobs said that he always gave the hardest jobs to the laziest people. Students, like everyone else, have a tendency to be lazy. If students were allowed to design their own projects, many would do the bare minimum to get it out of the way. By allowing teachers to design the projects, this would be mitigated and ensure all students worked hard. The College Board works to ensure that all students are treated equal during standardized tests. If Colleges give everyone equal work and opportunity, it only makes sense for all other levels of school to do this as well. Through teacher designed projects, teachers could ensure that everyone is on an equal playing field. By doing this teachers would not allow students to unknowingly disenfranchise themselves of necessary skills. This way all students will be equal ready in their college readiness. All students would equally benefit from the teacher assigned projects.

Though students may enjoy designing their own projects, teacher-designed projects would provide greater benefit to all students. Through the teachers' intellectual maturity and experience they would provide better practice with the purpose and skills within the projects. Their knowledge of whats to come would also provide students with solid foundations for the upcoming school year, starting them off on the right foot. Teachers ability to provide equal opportunity for all students would ensure future success by ensuring proper habits are formed. Teachers, not students, should design summer projects to combat the summer slide because of their acquired skills in teaching, their insight to the students' futures, and how they can instill success equally to their students.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
07881BC0DDB9,"In my opinion I think that the teacher should pick the projects they want their students to do. The teacher can design the project in a way that they're able to relate to the information that their students were taught the previous year. By having the teacher design the project it will help the students to be able to remember most of the information they were taught throughout the school year and could help them for the next school year. Most students do tend to forget a good portion of the things they were taught in school over break.

When I'm out of school on summer break, the last thing I'll ever think about is school. Being out of school and having other things on my mind like having a job, I only ever think about the very little stuff that I was taught in school that I might actually need. I mostly watch TV or I'm on social media so of course I'm not going to remember half the stuff taught to me. The only classes that can be useful to me are math and personal finance. The idea of a teacher giving me a summer project would be a better option rather than having to come up with one on my own.

A good reason to having a summer project designed by a teacher would be that when you start the new school year some of that information would still be there. Doing this project could help prepare yourself for the next school year. Having this project can keep you learning while your still on summer break. While doing this project you could possibly learn some new things that could be of good use. This project can make the teachers job a little easier by having this summer project.

Now if it were up to the students to design their own projects they probably wouldn't cover the main topics their teacher wants them to. Some students might only cover the things that they only remember and it could possibly not help them for the new year. Other students might forget about the project or wait till last minute to do the project if it were up to them to design their own project. If these things were to happen it wouldn't be helping the teacher or the student.

In conclusion, I still think it would be best if the teacher were to design the summer projects and not the students. The teacher can get the students to present the information that they will need heading into the new school year. Some teachers are wiling to help keep their students learning over break to make it a little easier when school starts again. If I was offered the opportunity I would take it rather to be struggling in the beginning of the year.

Everything that I stated point towards the reason why I say the teachers should design the summer projects and not the students.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
1509D8D81A10,"Should you do a project in the summer based on what your teacher tells you? Well, for a start you should because it can benefit you in any point in life, education is essential in life; without it, we wouldn't be able to understand things that we do now and days. Students summer project should be teacher-designed assignments because they could focus on just specific topics, they can already have sense of what they will learn for next year class, and it can help students determine what their career will be.

However, some may not agree with this position. Some may argue that students should make their own design for making a project. Student should express themselves and design something that would benefit them or something that they really like. For example, Albert Einstein was famous for being a very intelligent man. He wanted to get smarter every day, and he was getting smarter everyday. He did anything just for his knowledge to grow. He was recognized for being the first person to create a nuclear bomb formula. Nevertheless, there are other viewpoints to consider.

To begin with, student could focus on just specific topics. When teachers assign you with an assignment, it's easy because you know exactly what to do. When you have a topic for the project you know exactly what to search. Project like these are simple and easy to make, and beneficial for your knowledge. It can take some time but if you focus on the topic it would be easier then not having a topic.

In addition, student can have a sense of what they will learn next year in class. Projects over the summer can help students know what they will learn next year for 9,10,11,and 12 grade. Assignment like this can benefit students for their next school year, they would have a head start of knowledge on any assignments that come to them through out the years. Scientist have shown that every single day that we don't learn new things, we lose 0.06% of our memory.

Finally, students can determine what their career will be. When working in a project, either big or small, it can encourage student to see what they are really passionate about. Sometimes when students working in a project over the summer; they can discover new thing while researching things about the topic, either it's related to science, technology, history, or literature.

In conclusion, Students summer project should be teacher-designed assignments because they could focus on just specific topics, they can already have sense of what they will learn for next year class, and it can help students determine what their career will be. Therefore, teacher-designed projects is a great option because teachers knows whats best for their students and what requirements they need.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
D12A571CCFA4,"I dont even know what this place is,i cant write about this! There is an ongoing debate on weather working on projects during the summer time should be teacher-deigned or student-designed. Those who oppose state students will get more knowledge and challenge students,but this is not true. Although some may disagree, students should design the projects.

There are a variety of reasons students should design the projects. First, students will easier projects. We go to school for nearly 10 months out of a year and work hard so we should have easy projects. Also,students have sports that they play during the summer. And if they design the project they can do it about the sports they play. During the summer it is hot and thats the perfect time for families to be going on vacations they can make a project about the places they went. Students can learn from other students .Some students, teachers and staff can not go on vacation so if another student does a project on a place someone did not know about they learned about a new place.

There are further reasons students should design the projects. Us students work during the year and do school related projects. So if we go out and explore other activities and then do the project about it well make school much more exciting. Also, Family time, students can write about what they did with their family or new family they met and did not they had. Last, the weather in summer is great we are out enjoying the weather playing on playgrounds and at water parks teachers would not have thought about doing a project on water parks but students will.

Although some may disagree,the projects students do should be student designed. This is the case due to make projects easier,creative ideas,and student explore and learn new thing. Those who oppose state get more knowledge and challenge students but this is not true. The summer should be kept for our fun time and wanting to do a project about something we liked or enjoyed over the summer.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
A5CFDDC32628,"Education from schools are important for students so that they can take on the challenges of the future. School work can be overwhelming and stressful and having a summer break is nice to look forward to. However the work shouldn't stop because it is hard to get back into learning after a long break from school. School projects over the summer are a great way to keep the brain active and learning for the following year. Summer break should be a time to relax and have fun; however, learning is a crucial part of development. That is why I think the summer projects should be enforced and student-designed. A student-designed summer projects would allow students to improve on the skills they are struggling in and get help with specific subjects. Since the only person that knows a student better is the student, basing a project by themselves would be more helpful than if a teacher designed it. If a student was able to choose a project on their own, it would most likely be short, but reasonable. That gives the student more time to participate in activities that weren't possible because of school work. Student-designed projects allows students to get additional information that will strengthen their knowledge, and allow students to have more freedom.

Student-designed projects allow for a better and helpful project. One of the reasons why it would be more helpful is because students would be able to base the project on something they are struggling with. Many advance or regular classes are fast paced and it can lead to the student falling behind. The summer project would help the student get the extra help and information on the subject. Since many teachers have other students and lots of other work, it is hard for them to focus on just one. If a teacher designs a project for a student they dont know much about, it can be almost useless for the student to do because it doesnt have as much value in it, as if a student, who knows what to work on, designs a project. So having the project be student-designed, it would be better and helpful for both the student and the teacher. It would also be a more productive way to use the time given in summer break.

Experience is one of the most important things at a young age. Students need time to develop skills that are needed in the future, like working and other activities. Summer break an excellent time to work and develop those skills. If the project is student designed, it would also work around their summer schedule. They would get the learning that they need and the experience that is helpful. During the summer break, the students can go on vacations and other trips. Even though learning is crucial, taking a break is equally as important. The brain can only take so much information and stress before it is too much. It is always good to relax and not stress. If the project was student designed, it would help with the problem of stress because the project would seem more like a helper tool than a school assignment.

I think the project should be student-designed because it is beneficial in many different ways. It teaches students to be responsible for creating a project that best suits them, it allows for more freedom, and it provides additional help for more difficult subjects. All are great reasons why the project should be student-designed and I think students will benefit tremendously, even more than if teachers designed the projects. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
89CFF87ACA7B,"Summer assignments are the bane of any student's desire to enjoy the three months of freedom from school. However, they are critical in order to ensure that the student continues his or her education while not in school. With this in mind, these summer projects should be designed by the teacher to allow for more a more in-depth education about the subject when the school year starts up once again.

The point of summer projects, first and foremost, is to ensure that students gain or retain requisite knowledge for the course. This means that the student is trusted to enrich himself or herself with the required knowledge to complete the assignment. One example of such is the summer assignment required for AP Calculus BC at Generic_School. Students were required to complete a 16-page packet that covered all of the material that was covered the previous year: parametrics, polar coordinates and systems, limits, derivatives, applications of limits and derivatives, trigonometry, and so on. They were then expected to take a test on all of that material two weeks after the school year started up again. The purpose of this assignment was to ensure the student retained the requisite knowledge before progressing further into the school year. This meant that only two weeks were required to review the material from the previous year, allowing the class to progress at an accelerated rate because the students had already displayed mastery over the previous year's material.

Another example of a summer assignment ensuring that students gain necessary knowledge prior is the summer assignment for AP English Language and Composition. This assignment differs from the previous example in that it focused more on educating students on how to compose and analyze well-written pieces of literature. Students were required to read two books:

On Writing by Stephen King and

Educated by Tara Westover.

On Writing , a memoir about King's life and a guide on how to write, taught students about how to compose meaningful writing, covering aspects like cognizance of tone, diction, sentence and paragraph length, visual appeal of the text, conveying detail properly, and so on. Students were required to create a ""writer's toolbox"" just as King did in his book, listing out seven tips in King's memoir and seven additional tips that the student had learned from previous experience. Such tips included not beginning a sentence with a conjunction, weaving simple, compound, and complex sentences to make a piece of writing more appealing, creating a sound structure for an essay, and keeping the audience in mind when writing. Students were then required to apply those skills in analyzing the rhetorical choices of Tara Westover in her book,

Educated . Students chose two aspects of writing that they found from reading

On Writing and analyzed how Westover used those aspects to create her autobiography. This allowed students to learn how to analyze a piece of literature from a rhetorical perspective rather than a literary perspective. Because students had this introductory experience, they were able to conduct rhetorical analyses at a more in-depth level during the school year.

Summer assignments, annoying as they are, are definitely useful tools to give students the opportunity to establish foudational knowledge for a course they will be taking when the school year starts once again. As such, these projects should be designed by the teachers of the course so they can move at an accelerated rate or spend more time speaking about smaller details or more complex ideas within the course. A student would not be able to craft such assignments because summer plans, vacations, and other priorities would take precedence over further education. Thus, it falls upon the teacher to ensure that the required knowledge is gained for the course before the start of the school year.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
9523EFEED498,"Students Decisions Can Lead to Greatness

Wait, teachers are the one's who decide what student's summer projects are? Believe it or not at most schools teachers are the one's who decide students summer projects. This is completely wrong and unjust because, teachers are not the one's who are doing the project it's the students, and therefor should be their decision on what they want to do. When teachers assign summer projects they are uninteresting to the students and do not correlated at all with students interests, which is essential if teachers expect the project to be good and finished by the end of summer.

Although some may believe otherwise, summer projects should be student designed because, the project will be according to the student's interests and therefor motivate them to accomplish it, leading to future successes and the students will be able to have a choice of what they want to do rather than the teachers deciding for them, which will make them feel more independent and free.

It's important that summer projects are student designed to ensure for a better quality project from students along with a positive attitude while accomplishing.

The project will be according to the students interests and therefor motivate them to accomplish it, leading to a result beyond the teachers standard.

It is important that a summer project is according to the students interests to ensure for an overall higher quality project, completed by the time summer comes to an end. Take for instance Christian Benito, a famous Peruvian soccer player who played in the world cup. In an interview about his life before fame he stated that he realized his love for soccer while completing a school summer project, junior year at a high school in Peru. Because his project was a self designed essay based on his passion, he was motivated to accomplish it on time and even ended up reading the essay in front of his coach on live television. Another popular figure who was motivated to accomplish her self designed project is singer/songwriter Demi Lovato, who throughout her time in high school dealt with bullying and disorders. She never had the opportunity to express her feelings publicly but finally had the opportunity when she was given the choice of her topic for her summer project. She said she usually does not complete summer projects when they are teacher designed because they are boring but because she was able to chose her topic and presentation she enjoyed the project and was motivated to complete it on time, even going on to share the project about her high school experience with her worldwide fans.

The students will be able to have a choice of what they want to do rather than the teachers deciding for them, which will make them feel more independent and free.

Freedom is one of the most important things and is most important for students at school because it can lead to creative thinking and new ideas. An example of someone who was able to have a choice in what they wanted to do for their summer project rather than the teacher is my dad, Generic_Name, who instead of being tied to a specific topic or have to follow a specific guideline, for his art class summer project, was free to do what he wanted. His given responsibility made him feel more free and creative leading to his creation of an art piece beyond compare. His responsibility eventually payed off in the end when his project about art received the highest grade possible and ended up being pinned outside of his classroom for all the other students to admire. Another person who felt more independent and free when given the choice to design a summer project is my cousin, Generic_Name, who is currently 17 years old but was given the choice to design her own summer project for her English class her sophomore year of high school. Because she had the choice of what she wanted to do she told me she felt free because, she felt as if her teacher constantly made decisions for the class and was glad she was finally able to make one herself.

Some may say that summer projects should be teacher designed because if they are student designed, they will not meet the teachers standards and will be poorly done. Although this point is understandable, considering that some students may not try their hardest when given a choice for their assignment, it is wrong. Not only will students meet the teachers standard if the summer project is student designed, but go beyond the standard and ensure that it is a meaningful and A+ worthy project. For example when I had to complete a summer project for my English class last year, the design of the project was my choice which made me feel generally more relaxed and inspired. Because the assignment was up to me I took my time on making a children narrative that explained everything we learned in the year. My teacher was only expecting everyone to have a small project about simply one subject, but I exceeded that standard because I felt creative and had no limits to what I could accomplish.

Overall, in life it's important to understand that student's have options and freedom for what they want to do. When it comes to summer projects it is the student who is accomplishing the project not the teacher, which is why it is only fair that it be the students decision when it comes to the design of a summer project. If teachers were the one's who decided all of students summer projects this would lead to the destruction of students freedom and eventually result in poorly done summer assignments. In a perfect world, if summer assignments were completely student designed their would be a world of opportunity and creativity that would impact both the student and the teachers and maybe even the world. In the end it's not the teacher who should determine or limit a students success. Only the student's choice will determine their successes in life.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
827C8F96A128,"When assigning mandatory summer projects for students, they should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed. The first reason is because the students can make it whatever they want and however they want to do it. The second reason is it is more fun and creative for the students if they do their own designed project. Lastly, it is a lot easier for the students to complete the project if they design it themselves.

However, some may argue that these summer projects should be teacher-designed. Assigning projects that are teacher-designed will probably make it easier on some students because then they do not have to think about what their project could be about. They can just follow the teacher's instructions and the rubric, if given one, and then complete the project based off the teacher's design for it. Nevertheless, there are other viewpoints to consider.

The first reason for having a student-designed project would be that the students can make it whatever they want. They can think of their own ideas and how they want to do their project. If a student has an interesting and unique idea for the project that he knows will benefit him more than whatever a teacher could have designed, then he should be able to carry out that idea for his project. Not only would he/she be doing a project they can actually learn from, but it will be interesting for them to do.

Another reason for a student-designed project would be that it is more fun for the students. You are already assigning them a mandatory summer project that they have to do and take away from their summer break, the least you could do is let the students decide how they want to design their projects. Sure you can give them a general idea of what the project has to look like and an overall basis of what it should include and be about, but I believe the main point of the project and how they create it should be up to the students.

Lastly, a student-designed project will overall be easier then what a teacher would design. The students are just trying to relax and enjoy their summer and will probably just not do the project at all if a teacher designs it to be hard or uninteresting to the students. If the students decide what and how they want to do the project, they are more likely to complete the task because they chose something that is interesting to them which will not only benefit them, but also fulfill the school and teacher's requirements to complete a summer project.

In conclusion, if schools require that students have to complete a summer project, the least they could do is leave it up to them to decide how the project is designed. It would not only benefit them more if they designed it, but also make it more interesting for them so they actually want to complete it. I can personally guarantee that the majority of students either do not finish any summer assignments they are given or just don't bother to do them whatsoever. That is because they find it pointless to them and they know it will not benefit them in anyway. That is why teachers should assign student-designed summer projects rather than teacher-designed projects. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
3020EB58260E,"As we all know, summer is just about every kid's favorite season. Why is that? They have no school. They don't have to worry about waking up at six o'clock every morning; just to go and deal with nagging teachers all day, and come home and stay up until midnight doing homework. Summer is a break, and a much needed one. Kids get to have fun, hang out with their friends, and go on vacation.

But, there is one thing kids dread about summer break: summer projects. They don't have to be as hated, though. Only reason they are so disliked is because it's the same thing every year. If we gave kids a choice on what they did, if we let them design their own projects, they will be more inclined to do them and do them well. Kids like to be in control, and if we let them think they are, they will prosper. Also, creating their own projects gives them a new way to learn and prepares them for life ahead.

If students create their own projects, they will be more interested and more likely to actually do it. Kids like to be in control, and if they think they are, they will be encouraged to to put real effort in. I remember when I was ten, my parents told me I finally had to start doing chores. I didn't want to, of course, no kid does. But then, my parents came to me with a proposition. If I created my own list of chores, with reasonable prices and a good schedule, I could execute chores in that manner. I liked the fact that they gave me the responsibility; they gave me the choice to pick and choose, and I felt encouraged to do my chores. Summer projects are no different. When given a task, and a choice kids will more likely get the work they needed to be done. Along with how giving kids a choice will make them more interested, it will also help them prepare for life ahead. For the rest of their life, kids will be given a task and told to execute it however they please, in college and in their work field. Adding summer reading to the list of things students will be creating on their own will only prepare them for later on.

Students will have to do summer projects regardless. It is the only thing to keep their brain fresh, and to have the ability to retain everything they have learned. Giving them a choice just encourages them to do it well and prepares them for their future. While others may say: giving students a choice won't let the project be done correctly or it migh be off track; students will still get some type of learning in, and they did it on their own. ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
477B00F899E2,"Student-designed Projects Encourage Learning

Summers can be boring for students, especially when homework is assigned. Students have creative minds and a variety of interests which can be specialized to a topic of interest; however, schools tend to assign a generic assignment to all students despite their differences. Summer projects are intended to enable students to continue learning and exploring the world through a lense of their interest. Therefore, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to spark, their creativity to grow, and their areas of knowledge to expand.

Firstly, student-designed summer projects will allow for every student to specify the project on his or her interests. Every child is different and shows admiration towards different subjects in school. If teachers design the summer project, the students will lack incentive to explore an area of interest as that has already been done for them. Additionally, teachers will attempt to design the summer project in a way that it applies to all students; however, not all students think alike. For example, most middle schools conduct science fairs that allow kids to explore an area of science that particularly interests them. This allows for children to research heavily into a subject and even enjoy doing so. This not only sparks an interest for science, but it also allows students to show off their abilities and specialize in their talents. This science fair analogy can be applied to summer projects because children will develop their admiration towards an educational topic and will enjoy the learning process. This creates a positive incentive for learning despite it being summer.

Secondly, if students are enabled to design their own summer projects, creativity will occur and develop. When teachers design projects, students are incentified to simply follow instructions and do as they are told. This results in surface level researching and a lack of interest in actually learning and retaining knowledge. This is understandable as most students do not enjoy a generic assignment that does not apply specifically to their interests. However, if students were given the opportunity to design their own project, they could research a subject that sparks their interest and creativity. This will lead to a deeper understanding of the topic and will result in a better quality of summer projects completed over all. For example, refering back to the science fair analogy, most students will become creative and design their own experiments if they are given the opportunity to do so. Most students enjoy being given the freedom and trust to become creative and show off their interests.

Lastly, when students return to school after summer break, they will see a variety of interesting summer projects completed by their classmates. The student-designed projects allow for a large variety of topics to be explored, and will benefit the students intensely. If all students, for example, have the same assignment, they would be less interested in their classmates projects as they would all be generically similar. However, if the students have the opportunity to design and conduct their own research into their favorite topic, then the students can share each others interesting new insights with each other and spread their knowledge. This increases students admiration for learning and will inentify them to study something interesting for their classmates.

In conclusion, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to be explored, their creativity to flourish, and their areas of knowledge to expand. Schools tend to fail to recognise that each student is different, and that he or she requires different learning styles in order to be successfull in learning. It is vital that students are given the opportunity to become creative and explore an interest that is dear to them. If this is not prioritized, schools will continue to foster the idea of simply following instructions.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
C75687356FFE,"A project during the summer, is a students worst nightmare. Certain schools do this to insure that their students are still learning during the vacation. If students designed this projects over the summer,not only will they have fun while learning, have all the creativity in the world, they will be willing to complete the tasks and more students will do the assignment.

During the summer, students participate in a variety of events. Students go camping, travel to different places, and much more. All these activities that they are involved in could lead to very interesting projects. Students could write about visiting the Eiffel Tower or an essay on how to catch a fish. All these creative ideas can come out of letting students designed their own projects.

As kids students were thought the alphabet and their numbers through joyful and exciting ways. Whether it was watching Sesame Street and learning how to count or learning songs about the alphabet, learning was made in a way that they were expanding their knowledge with out evening being aware. Allowing students creative freedom on the project will led to these same results. The student will be expand their knowledge while having fun at the same time.

However, none of this matters if the student is not going to do the project. Summer vacation is viewed as a break off of school so students often will not do work. Providing students with the authority to create their own project insures the probability of them completing the task. Students tend to engage in activity that interest them, so allowing them to do so will make it more likely for the assignment to be completed.

Furthermore, if the schools are going to make students do a summer project, they should allow the student to decide what they want to do. This will lead to more students completing the task, creative ideas which each assignment handed in and the students will be expanding their knowledge while being excited to learn.          ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

To prevent ruining students' breaks, teachers at schools that require summer projects should ensure that these projects are student-designed. Having student-designed projects as a pose to teacher-designed projects will make projects more enjoyable for students and give them a feeling of fulfillment upon completion. Student-designed projects will also make students less likely to procrastinate and prepare them for the real world.

When you have been assigned a summer assignment by your teacher, how many times have you dreaded it knowing that it will be many boring hours of work that could have been spent with friends? For most people, they felt this way every time. Instead of frustrating students like teacher-designed projects do, student-designed projects will motivate students to pursue their passions and actually do research and work on subjects that they care about. In addition, student-designed projects are far more fulfilling to complete than a repetitive teacher-designed project that assigns the same couple of directions to every single student. In simple terms, student-designed projects are far more enjoyable and fulfilling for students and they will not spoil a student's summer break.

Another pattern among students that are assigned teacher-designed projects is that they wait until the last minute to start working. If a teacher-designed project is due on the first day of the second week of school, it is very likely that students will not start their ""summer"" projects until after school year has already begun. On the other hand, the more enjoyable student-designed projects will actually motivate most students to do something with all the time they have off during summer. Thus, students will be less likely to procrastinate and they will actually do their work in a timely, efficient manner instead of waiting for the last minute.

The most beneficial part of a student-designed project is that it prepares students for the real world. Student-designed projects force students to think for themselves and come up with their own unique, potentially brilliant ideas. The most successful business men in the world got to the point that they are at because of their individual ideas. For example, Elon Musk would not be where he is if he did not come up with Tesla or Space-X. The point is, student-designed projects force students to think individually. Without individual thought, it would be impossible for students to unlock their full potential and make their way into the top 1%.

With far more benefits, assigning student-based projects is superior to assigning teacher-based projects. Some may argue that teacher-designed projects are fairer to students because they assign every student the same project. However, student-based projects allow students to apply themselves to a subject that they have an actual interest in and produce far better results than the ""equal"" teacher-based projects do. In other words, would you rather have students go into the real world ready and able to think for themselves or would rather have machine-like students who only know how to follow directions? You decide.         ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
8BE96D64F102,"Schools assigning summer projects is a smart idea, considering most high school kids spend summer eating junk food, staying out late with friends, and then sleeping most of the day. During the summer most students have fun and dont do any school work which leaves them feeling behind and dumb when they return the next school year. Giving students the opportunity for student-designed projects does teach responsibility and freedom, however teacher-designed projects presents students with the content they need to know, its more unified, and more stuctured.

Teachers know what content students are supposted to learn throughout the school year, so they should present that content through the summer projects. This would help students gain the knowledge that kids need to aquire. A A good example is how this year at Generic_School, administration has desided to try peronal learning, personal learning means teachers are not supposted to directly teach which requires students to do projects and independent work to teach themselves. This change is new at Generic_School, but so far the outcome is not benfical for students learning. Students cant just do random projects on topics they are interesterd in learning about, that doesnt lead to being successful in gaining knowledge. Teachers should give out projects in order for kids have some kind of guide lines to follow, helping them learn what they need to know.

Not only would teachers presenting the correct content help kids learn, it would also make it more unified. All the students in a class should be presented with the same material, although everyone learns at different speeds, this would make it more fair. If everyone in the class got the same concept to learn and do a project on people could work togeather. Me and my friend Generic_Name do this a lot when we have the same assignment for a class we will hang out and get our work done, its very helpful working with her or other people and getting different perspectives or ideas. Rather than every student picking a different topic and learning about something unordinary like frog eggs, which isnt a necessity to know in life. If projects are given by teachers and everyone gets the same task its more unified and kids can learn while working with eachother, team work is a important life skill everyone has to learn.

Being a unified class is as equally helpful with learning as being structured. At my school we use online resources such as google classroom which is structured assignments that teachers post, it also help students stay on task. Structure is connected to orginization, it is proven that lack of orginization can cause students to fall behind with school. Most kids are not organized, students lose supplies and stuff all the time like its a teenager thing. Teachers are unually more organized, which proves they should be responible for giving the summer projects. Without structure from teachers students will do whatever they want like pick the simplist topic to do a project on.

During the school year most schools have teacher-designed projects and teachers actually teach what students are required to learn. Teachers create plans for their everyday classes, based off the content the state tells them students need to be taught. So why would teachers not continue doing what they have all year and just give out summer teacher-designed projects?",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
C5D2BF4CA642,"Would giving a person the opportunity to create something benefit them in the future? Throughout a person's school life what they are allowed to work on is continuously dictated by the teachers and school's administration. One major aspect of school that is dictated by the teachers is the summer projects students are required to complete. By the summer project being a teacher created assignment, there are quite a few restrictions as to what the student is capable of doing. Due to this, the summer project should be a student-designed project in order to stimulate greater interest, allow more flexibility, and increase the responsibility of the student.

The first reason that the summer project should be a student-designed project is because it would stimulate greater interest into what they are able to work on. An example of this would be a student's yearly science fair project. By granting students the ability to control what they researcher their interest and desire to complete the project is increased. With increased interest also comes a higher possibility that the work done by the student will be completed on time as well as not be plagiarized. Not only will it motivate students to want to perform well while also putting in the effort that is required to pass, but it will also make it an enjoyable task to complete.

The next reason that summer projects should be student-designed is because it would provide more flexibility. This would be seen by allowing students the chance to set their own limits and/or restrictions.

Being able to set their own restrictions make it to where the students can finish the project more efficiently. Increased flexibility would also grant the student the opportunity to create their own work schedule. More control over their scheduling will help decrease the possibilities of being stressed and overworked, it could also present the opportunity to students to work alongside one of their peers in order to complete their chosen assignment. Most of all more flexibility could have a direct correlation to how enjoyable the completion of their assignment would be.

The third, and final, reason that students should design their own summer project is because it could increase the responsibility of the student. Many people argue that, during their school age, students require more guidance and are not capable of making their own decisions. By continuously imposing rules and restrictions on students they become incapable of maneuvering through assignments on their own. With that become unable to learn the best way for them to be able to complete assignments. Giving students the responsibility that they deserve and need will aid them in the future. When it comes to college, it could help them with working on different task on their own and coming up with efficient ways of completing said task. While in the work force, it will aid them in cognitive thinking and the ability to think on their own and not have to depend on their coworkers for the answers.

In order to stimulate greater interest, allow more flexibility, and increase the responsibility of the student, the summer project should be student-designed. Allowing students to design the summer project will not only benefit them, but the teachers as well. Both sides would gain from the encounter and will likely be able to use the information from the experience for future references. Most of all this could provide students with some clarity as to how the real world functions and the choices they may be required to make some day.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
8A7433E0DF67,"Imagine on the last day of school your teacher tells your class that she is assigning a summer project to you, most people would be upset about it because they want to enjoy their break but the teacher told them they could make there own project or she can assign them one most student chose to make up there own. I personally would do my own project Im not really a project person but i think i would have so much fun doing my own.

Some schools require summer projects i think the students should be able to make up there own project, although some students choose to get assigned one the other students want to make there own project up they can make one up about all kinds of things like if they visited somewhere they can do one about where they went, what they did, did they do it with family or friends. Students can still get learning out of making there own project. But some students dont really do anything over the summer break they might not have interest in going anywhere or doing anything so they will need there teacher to assign them one.

Students who are making there own project will probably have a hard time doing theirs because they have to go out and explore to get the information on the project but with the teachers assignment the students can use resources on a device to find their information. Some students that picked the teachers assignment may not have a device to use to help them find information on there project so they might have to take a teachers class book home over summer to help them but, some students may not be responsible enough to take one home with them. The students will still be learning while they do it because they are reading information out of a book or off line.

The students with there own project will most likely have more fun doing there assignment because they have to go out and explore for their project. Most students will probably do a project on where they went and what they did over break they also might have a friend with them that they did stuff with over break might want to help them with there project.

Although people still want to do there own project i hope this will help you understand doing your own project will be so much fun. So with that all being said i think it would be better to have a student to their own project they will have more fun out of it, they get to tell people about what they got to do over break, and last but not least they get to do a lot more activities.",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
B6B28560FA92,"A summer project is one of the last things a student may expect to work on during the longest break of the school year; some schools assign students a summer project in order to ensure that they are continuing to learn during their nearly three month-long break. Incidentally, a number of students may recieve a project that they might find to be unsatisfactory towards a certain preference like a subject that they prefer. Summer projects should be student-designed as opposed to teacher-designed, because a student-designed project will give one far more creative freedom, it can give one the ability to be flexible with assignments, and it can allow one to have an opportunity for reflection.

Firstly, student-designed projects will allow students to have a large amount of creativity and originality with their own projects since they themselves are chosing what to do, having more creativity in ones project means that one can attain more individuality. With this in mind, once all projects assigned have been completed, schools will recieve a large number of diverse, varying projects that are all individually unique in their own ways, which is reflective of the students' personalities and preferences. The student-designed projects might also present ideas to teachers and how they can make assignments for students.

Secondly, a student-designed project will give one the ability to be flexible, adaptible, and effecient at completing future projects and assignments, eventually gaining more experience. This can lead to one suceeding and improving their performance on other assignments and projects; however, the same can be said for a teacher-designed project, although, what makes a student-designed project differ from a teacher-designed project is simply because the project is made by oneself and therefore, one can get a better understanding of themselves, and find the necessary materials to use for the project.

Lastly, a student-designed project can allow one to have an opportunity for self-reflection as one can find out what certain personal preferences, methods, and other specific and unique traits one has. This can benefit oneself greatly because it gives a further insight into how one can complete an assignment, because of themselves and the experience that they have gathered through the way of completing a project.

In summary, schools should consider assigning student-designed projects to those during the summer. Summer projects should be student-designed as opposed to teacher-designed, because a student-designed project will give one far more creative freedom, it can give one the ability to be flexible with assignments, and it can allow one to have an opportunity for reflection. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
4D4548484E40,"Summer is a great time for self education. Student designed summer education is helpful because students are aware of their low points, should be a variable in their success, and should be working comfortably during the summer. Teachers may know a lot about their students, but no one understands the students like themselves. If a student is struggling on something, they can work on it as a project over the summer. As the student, it's your job to complete a task, and you should have no complaints over a project designed yourself.

During the summer, students would need time to de-stress over school. Therefore, students should be able to construct projects that are comfortable for them. Some may say that all school projects should be designed by the teacher, however, they are not the students. Occurring over the summer, school projects should be designed by the student because of the students knowledge of their struggles, they are their own success, and it should be a comfortable leaning opportunity.

Being aware of your own flaws if something nearly everyone is great at, and working to better yourself is the next step in that process. When I was younger, everyone would assume that I was just a kid and didn't understand that I was doing wrong. Although I may not have taken action upon it, I knew that not doing work or submitting to peer pressure was bad. Student's understand their faults and they know what they need to work on to fix them.

Knowing your faults is one thing, but acting upon them is important. Many students, when given a choice in their work, will choose not to work hard or procrastinate upon them. I can attest to this myself, as I set many self projects for myself that I do not complete. Students who are hard working and care about their grade will complete their goals. Self made projects put the student in charge of their work and help them understand that they must complete it.

Summer is a break time off of school, therefore, students should not have to be given work that could be stressing or uncomfortable. Tens of thousands of students drop out of education due to stress and is part of the reason why there is such a large time interval between the beginning and end of the school year. Any extra work after school has ended should be kept to a comfortable, non-stressful amount of work. When students design their own projects over the summer, they make it comfortable for themselves.

The summer is a long break between school and students should have a say in any work that is assigned to them during it; this is because students are aware of what they need to improve on, should be in charge of their work and whether they complete it or not, and should be able to make their work comfortable. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
4889971AB30F,"School summer projects should always be designed by teachers because they know what is best for students to work on, and what they need for later years in high school. Unlike teacher-designed, student-designed instead does not alway comes with appropriate content for the project, but also could break school policies. Teachers could provide students enough informations about their project, and instructions for students to understand as they follow through it.

Student-designed summer projects on the other hand, which is not always school supported, and a lot of people would tend to think it is a lot harder;however, it depends on what subject of the project they are working on, and those could be any topic such as Math, English, Science, and Social Study. One were to be about Astronomy, where students would have to reinvent what was already existed and present it to the class;if it were to be student-designed, they could be working on reinventing weapons, alcohols, and drugs, which would be against the school policies. During the summer, some students would want all their full free time, so they would get lazy, decided to be careless, or forget about their student-designed project and get a bad result on it.

As for teacher-designed project, the easier, the better, where it will always be school appropriate, would help students into understanding their project, learning more from it, and have experienced from it. Teacher-designed would help students gather their materials into what they are aiming to do in their future.",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
A69B61336132,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during thier break. Do you think that these summer projects should be student-designed or teacher- designed? Many people feel that it should be student-designed and others feel it should be teacher-designed. In my opinion, Students should design the summer projects that they have to do.

First of all, The projects should be student-designed because they can make it fun and it would give them more of a desire to actually do the project. The students can make it more fun because they know what the enjoy doing over summer or what they would be able to make fun. They would have more of a desire to do it because they made it and because it would be fun and not completely complicated. For example, Generic_Name and her classmates had to do a summer project and their teachers designed the project. Generic_Name and her friends didnt do the project because whenever they got ready to do it together a couple of them got bored with it because it was not fun and the other students did not complete it because it was too complicated for them to do. That is one reason as to why I believe that students should design their own summer projects.

Secondly, If a student designs their own summer projects they will more than likely do a better job on it. Students are just like everyone else and they do a better job on something they made up themselves. Students like to do their own things and if a teacher desnigned the project they would not be able to enjoy it and do a better job on it. For example, Mrs. Generic_Name gave have her class a specific summer project they had to do and she allowed the other half of her class to choose what they would like to do for a project. They students that did not get to choose their project either did not do it or did not get that well of a grade on it because they were not at all interested in it. However, the students that did get to choose thier projects did complete it and they all did very well on it. That is way in my opinion, teadcher should not design the summer projects for students, but students should design the projects themselves.

On the other hand, If teachers designed the summer projects they would have more indepth questions and work to do that would get students brains thinking and learning. Teacher also know all of the critearia that has to be followed. Teachers are able to make projects fun and enjoyable as well as give the students a little stuggle with the work so they would actually be learning instead of just flying right through the project. I do still believe that students should design their own projects.

In conclusion, my opinion is that students should design their own summer projects because they know what they like for fun things and they would do a better job on their project if they designed it. I do see how it would benifit if teachers designed it however students would still do a better job on it and have more fun and do it on time if they designed the summer project themselves. What is you opinion on this topic?",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
38544AECD63C,"Summer is the one thing that students look forward to the most during the year. Depending on the class and teacher, work is assigned to be completed before returning to school. Sometimes the work assigned can be a bore but other times students actually enjoy the work that teachers give them. Summer projects assigned by teachers can take up a lot of time that students need. Although some may believe otherwise, personal examples, interests and time proves that summer projects should be student-designed.

Personal examples prove that summer projects should be student designed. For example, I recall once that I had a summer project for a history class that I was going to take. A topic that was extremely boring and unfamiliar to me was assigned. I had no idea what I was doing nor did I actually understand the project. This shows that if projects were student-designed, students would be able to learn about a topic they actually know allowing them to perform better on it. Rather than doing a topic that they are weak in, students should be allowed to create summer projects that are suitable to them. Some may argue that when assigned an unfamiliar topic by teachers that students are given the opportunity to learn something new. This is not true because in many cases when a student is forced to do something they do not know best, they do not actually learn something. Therefore, this supports the fact that summer projects should be student-designed.

Interests prove that summer projects should be student-designed. My friend Generic_Name once had a book project in English that she had no interest in at all. The book and what she had to do were both strictly decided by her teacher. She would always text and call me complaining about how she had no motivation to do it. This shows that students should have the freedom of choosing what project they want to do, and how to approach doing the project. Teachers should not force students to do summer projects they have no interest in doing because then it will lead to the student not completing them. One may argue that students should not have the freedom to design their own summer projects because there are specific aspects that the student needs to learn. This is not true because if a student is assigned something they do not want to learn in the first place, they will not learn anything at all. Therefore, interests also support the claim that summer projects should be student-designed.

Time proves that summer projects should be student-designed. Many students happen to have summer jobs and are even on sports teams. My friend Generic_Name had soccer practice five days of the week with work right after. Some weekends she even had games so she barely even had time for herself. She did not have time to do any of the projects that were assigned by her teachers because she was just simply too busy and she was overloaded with summer work. This shows that if students are allowed to design their own projects that they can choose how much work they want to do on it. Student-designed summer projects can prevent students from having way too much work to complete all at once. Some argue that if a student is being productive and using their time effectively then they should be able to complete a project created by a teacher. This is not true because sometimes a student just simply does not have the time due to other commitments, meaning that if they are given the opportunity to design their own projects that they can easier balance out their workload. Time proves as well that summer projects should be student-designed.

Summer projects are important because they allow students to continue learning even when they are not in school. Summer projects that are student-designed have even more importance because they allow students to learn topics that are more suitable for them. In the past students have always been assigned summer work designed by teachers and have always dreaded it, but when they are allowed to design their own it has been very enjoyable. In the future, more schools should encourage students to design their summer own projects because they could learn so much from them. In order for students to learn during the summer, they should be assigned work that they will actually enjoy so they can use the rest of their summer time to relax. After all, teachers want students to be as relaxed as possible when coming back to school!",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
6401CA1C645F,"Whew! its summertime, and you're ready for the fun to begin. Except, you have that really big summer assignment from school. However, the project is one of your own design! You get to choose what you do and how you do it as long as it follows the guidelines. You're just glad it wasnt one your teacher came up with! Summer projects should be student-designed because it will make the students take on some responsibility and give them a sense of inclusion in their education.

The average person is in school about fourteen years. As you go through school you grow and you have to take on some responsibility. You have to do homework, projects, etc. While youre in school it is easy to accept these responsibilities, because you have a teacher and other student there to remind you of what you need to do. However, over the summer the only person there to be reminded by is yourself, and its difficult to remember something you're not interested in. By giving students the chance to design their own summer projects , you are putting them in a position to take responsibility. Not only for planning it, but for actually completing the assignment as well.

As student we already dont have a lot of say in our education. We are taught things based off of an outline that our teacher has to follow, and we are constantly being given assignments designed by the teacher or taken from pages of a textbook. It isnt uncommon for students to complain or be aggravated about not getting much say in what they get to do school-wise. By giving students the opprotunity to design and do a project on their own gives them a chance to be involved in their education and for them to call the shots. Not only does this make students feel inluded, but they are also more inclined to do better, and actually finish, something that they're interested in.

In conclusion, by giving students the chance to design their own summer projects you are puytting them in a position to acceot responsibility and to feel included in their education. Both of which should be a goal for all supporters of education.          ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
D1D8B04AF3A3,"Many schools in America assign summer assignments so the students will continue to learn throughout their summer break. Now this has people starting to question whether the assignment should be designed by the students or by the teacher. Which would be more beneficial to the students work ethic in the classroom for the upcoming year? While teachers have the experience and abilities to create the summer assignments, the projects should be designed by the students because the they would not feel as pressured or stressed and the students would base the project around what they need to learn.

To begin with, students designing their summer assignments would put less stress and pressure onto the student. The students being able to choose the amount of work they do over summer break will help the students feel better about the work and not feel as stressed about turning it in. While learning in school is a requirement and need for children and teenagers, it puts a lot of pressure onto the students which is harmful to the students well-being and mental health. During the summer, students should not have to worry about more work to get done by a certain due date. Instead, they should only be worried about their mental health and taking a well deserved break. After going to school for about nine months with very short breaks, students deserve to be able to sit back and relax for a little but instead they get bombarded by test graded projects from the school. Most of the time, students are unaware of the assignments or do not understand what they are supposed to be doing so they just do not turn in an assignment at all which results in the student starting the school year off with poor grades. It is important and beneficial for students to do these projects but the teacher-designed ones often become too much for a student to handle, especially with numerous ones from different teachers. The school should not put more stress onto their students by giving them projects that can lower their grade at the very beginning of a new school year.

Another reason summer assignments should be student-designed is because the students would focus the project more around what they need to learn. Most summer assignments are based on subjects the student has already learned, when the projects should be teaching them about what they are going to learn within the new class. If the summer assignments were student-designed, they would dig further into the new subject rather than working on items that they have already learned. It would be beneficial to the students if the work was more centered around what is going to be taught within the next school year. The students would also center the work around what feels most comfortable to them. Most teachers who give summer assignments do not think about what the kid may or may not be able to do. Meanwhile, students would rather work on items that they are able to do by themselves without any outside help. Some may say that the students would just give themselves less work resulting in them being lazy and not learning anything over their break and that the students would be unaware of the curriculum that they would be learning within the upcoming year so they would have no clue about what to focus their summer assignment on. While the students would give less work to themselves, it would be more beneficial to their learning experience and well-being. Also their teachers could provide a copy of the curriculum to the students so they would know what to base their project on.

In conclusion, teachers do an outstanding job at teaching during the school year but students should be able to design their own summer assignments. Students should able to create their own assignments because it would help the student not feel as stressed or pressured over their break. It would also be beneficial to their learning process because they would focus more on what they need to learn versus what has already been taught.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
6743F5B9985B,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. These projects should be student-designed because it can teach students how to manage their time and get their work done. A lot of student designed projects teaches more then teacher designed work.

Summer projects should be student designed because of ways it can teach students. Sometimes it can teach you how to manage your time, how to get work done in time, or give you an essay about what you learned during your summer break and how can it affect your life. It can even give you a task to research a specific topic and write a paper or journal about it. Sometimes summer projects will give you an easier task like reading a book over the summer and explain what you read once the school starts. There may be a project that requires you to make your own project.

One of the most common summer project you'll ever get is writing an essay about what you did over the summer. Even though it sounds really simple to do, it actually teaches you a lot about life. Students teach themselves everyday because they're trying new things in their lifes which makes this specific project very easy to do considering students always have something to write about. Even if the topic's not specifically about what you did over the summer, you can make essay about what changed your life or write something like ""Who inspired you to be who you are right now"".

Schools should require students to do student designed projects because student designed projects are specifically made for students to learn and to teach themselves in a way. Said it paragraph 1, it can teach the student how to manage time, complete or finish work in time, and gives the student full responsibility to finish their work. These types of projects can help students be mature about what they need to finish for school.

This comes down to the conclusion on why summer projects should be student designed and there are a lot of reasons behind it. Whether it's creating a slide show, writing an essay. or even researching on a topic, students learn a lot from these projects and helps the mind become stronger. That's why summer projects should be student designed.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
9A1F741EC88C,"Summer vacations are a much needed break for the teachers and students in school. Is is a time where students don't have to worry about the stress of grades, clubs, extracirriculars, or deadlines; also, teachers don't have to worry about grading papers, research projects, and the day to day stress of life. It's a nice time for a much needed break for both parties. Though called summer ""break"" or ""vacation,"" many schools require classes to instigate a summer assignment meant to keep students learning over their time off. Schools should not require students to work on summer assignments over the summer because it causes more stress when summer vacation is not meant to, the content of the assignment is often meaningless and unfair, and because it is not inductive on the students' learning.

Summer vacation is meant to be a break from the stress of school, but to impose schoolwork on a student's break is only going to add to the stress of the student. As seen in many studies, stress and anxiety often affect a student's performance not just academically, but also in health and happiness. Most of the stress of students come from the workload of school. This is why we have been seeing so many more children, especially teenagers in high school, get depression, or anxiety and stress disorders than we have seen in the past.

Summer vacation is a perfect way to unwind and relax the brain to prepare for the next academic school year riddled with stress. With the added work of summer assignments, the stress will follow the student into summer vacation, preventing them from relaxing. The summer break is a very important part of school in general, to get away from some of the stress and to mentally, physically, and emotionally prepare for the oncoming year.

Summer assignments given to students often don't have any meaningful or significant information that the student needs to know. Most summer assignments have either new information from the new school year, or old information from the previous year. Why should a student, having already learned something, do it over again in a time of break? Why should a student learn something by themselves just to have to relearn it at school? From what I have seen, most of the assignments are review from the previous year, or completely new information that we have to learn ourselves. If a student already knows a topic, they shouldn't have to repeat it over and over, especially when its not going to help their education. If a teacher assigns summer work that goes over the information for the coming year, it's lazy. A teacher is suposed to teach certain things by a certain date, and if they can't, the student shouldn't have to teach it to themselves. That is what a teacher is meant to do! This is significant as not every child has the same educational opportunites as others, and subjecting them to learn and teach themselves topic makes the whole idea of summer assignments discriminatory. Some may not have access to computers, the internet, or even have English-speaking parents who could help them with their school work. This is important now, as the socioecrnomic gap in socisety has only widened, which is another reason summer work should not be required.

Due to summer assignments being done at home with no teacher guidance, students would most likely cheat by means of the internet, or friends. Of course, that kind of behavior is discouraged, but not actively being carried through. I have seen over and over friends copying off of friends, or dividing the work, or just purely copying word for word off the internet. This is bad as it does nothing to help the student learn with a meaning, espcially if they're just using someone else's words and ideas. Believed by psychologists, to fully learn and remember, one most encode the information with a meaning, which means to make a connection or association with it. This is significant especially now, as technology advances, there are so many apps and websites that help students cheat, which is not inductive to their learning.

I understand why some may believe that summer assignments should be required in order to allow the child to learn and become independent in their education, but that's not efficient or helpful to the students' education. If anything, the child will become more dependent on friends and the internet to find the information, and as stated before, most of the assignments, from what I have seen, only have the information that will be learned during the school year. This and the amont of unfairness in educational opportunities, is why students should be allowed to give their brains a break instead of worrying over summer assignments during the break,

School should not require classes to give out summer assignments because it would only cause stress in a preiod of de-stress, it is often meaningless and unfair, and because it often does not help the student learn meaningfully. This is important in terms of the hundreds of thousands students who have to deal with it, but it is not what schools should be focusing on. School administration should not worry about trivial matters such as school assignments, but rather making sure that every student has a stable environment, enough food to eat everyday, and has access to the same educational opportunities as everyone else to allow for them to flourish. ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
CAC29E888AC2,"My teacher said that ""Projects in the summer should be student designed."" Students should get to do whatever they wanna do on this project. There should not be any requirements to no project unless the teacher gives out the directions. Summer break projects should be student designed because they can have fun with it, they can come up with different ideas, and do it on their own time. Ideas can lead up to many different outcomes and change what you are in the future. That's why students should be able to do student designed projects.

First, summer student designed projects should be a thing so that students can have fun with it in a way. They can come up with their own ideas and make the project interesting and filled with information. Even if they're having trouble, they can call up a close friend or family member to help them with it too and have fun at the same time. They can even look up the information online if needed. Students should have fun in the summer so that's why they need this.

Second, student school designed projects should happen because a lot of students can come up with different ideas for the project. Like I said before ideas can lead up to different creative ways and get your project done as fast as you can. These ideas can get their projects into school science fairs and stuff like that. Maybe they can learn some new stuff while coming up with ideas for the project. This way, they can keep learning during the summer.

Finally, designed projects for students during the summer should happen because they wouldn't have to rush through it. Summer should be a time for relaxing and not trying to overwork yourself. However students should be able to get some learning in that's why summer school exists. People can go there and get all the learning they want to and get their projects done in a short period of time. They are a perfect way to get time to yourself and get what you need to get done.

i prefer student designed projects over teacher because i'ts just a lot better in common. I like the idea of it and it sounds better you can get information in your mind like you haven't already had. It's sad that some schools don't have this because students need to get some learning in the summer even if its a little. All schools should have it, plus students will be able to thank their teachers and people in the school for doing this so they can have a better future. That's why i like it.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
4B5B0839A03D,"While Summer is usually designated as a time to be free of school, for both students and teachers, Summer projects linger to ensure continuous learning. These projects can be effective, but they can also be a detriment, not only to students, but to the teachers that have to create them. As such, students should be the designers of Summer projects.

The first group that comes to mind as being afflicted with Summer projects is students. Since students and teachers have different schedules, projects assigned over breaks can tend towards overly easy or overly difficult. If students had the ability to set their own pace for Summer projects, either by themselves or by class suggestions, they could be more prepared to learn without stress. While some may doubt that students would choose a helpful amount of work, the psychological idea of high achievement motivation shows that students that feel like they have self-sufficiency tend to assign themselves moderate challenges to encourage growth.

Though some students may think otherwise, teachers are also affected by Summer projects. Summer is the one long break teachers get before daily work starts again, and they often have to return to school weeks before Summer break ends for students. Forcing teachers to use their lengthiest break to continue leading student growth is clearly abnormal.

Allowing students to design their own Summer projects, or at least accepting their feedback into them, would be beneficial for both students and teachers. As such, it should be implemented immediately throughout schools to create a more effective learning environment.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
C1DE818F9D06,"Student Designed vs. Teacher Designed

Imagine you have just got assigned a summer project. You are given the topic of the assignment, but you are free to display your understanding of the material however you please, no guidelines. Would you have any idea what to do or how to even start? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue to learn during the break. What schools need to decide is that if these assignments would be more beneficial to students if they were teacher-designed or student-designed. Allowing students to design their own projects is a poor choice. Required summer assignments should be designed by a teacher because it would be the most fair choice for students, they would overall gain a better understanding of the material being taught, and they would be more likely to complete the project.

The first reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is fairness. Fairness is very important when it comes to determining the quality of a students work. Having students design their own projects makes grading everyone else's work to the same standard very difficult. For example, how does someone compare a written essay to a drawing? How would a teacher give every student fair scores based on how the individual chose to complete the assignment? When the teacher designs the project everyone is given the exact same outline. Every student is expected to answer the same number of questions and put forward the same amount of effort. Teachers being given the right to design the summer assignments would be the most fair decision for everyone involved.

Another reason why teachers should design the summer projects is that students would more likely better understand the material after completion of the assignment. If students were given the freedom to create their own project outline most of them wouldnt be able to answer many questions about the small details of the topic because they did not pay close enough attention. The material did not stick with them. Students typically worry about the ascetic of their project and completion instead of actually retaining the information. However, the purpose of a summer project is to learn new topics and be able to display a full understanding of the information. Teachers designing the summer assignments guarantees the students are exposed to the exact material they need to comprehend to obtain a good grade. The point of school is to learn and use what you have learned in the future. Students have a higher probability to remember the material from a teacher-designed project rather than one they made themselves.

The last reason teacher designed summer projects are more beneficial to students is that, when given a specific outline, the project is more likely to be completed. Answering guided questions or making a simple sideshow presentation are much easier and less time consuming for students rather than creating an entire project from scratch with no specific outline. Allowing students to create their own project could also cause huge amounts of stress. Most students when they become too stressed end up giving up or not putting in their best effort. Teachers giving them an outlined project can prevent this while also showing what the student has learned. Therefore, teacher- deigned projects are most likely to be completed and done well.

Some people believe that students should self-design their projects so they are able to express themselves creativity. Creative expression is important, but that is not the goal of a school assignment. Displaying what was learned is the goal. If students dont learn the material then what is the point of having a project? Teacher-designed projects guarantee that a student will learn something. Summer projects designed by teachers are more beneficial for students because they are fair for all students, result in a better understanding of the material, and are more likely to be completed. So teachers, next time you assign a summer project, please give your students an outline. Keep them away from over stressing and incomplete work in the grade book. Both your students lives and yours will be much simpler for it.  ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
B55FF7648652,"Some schools require students to complete a summer project during their break to make sure they are continuing their learning. However, it is discussed whether these projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Both types offer their benefits and disadvantages. On the one hand their is the student's choice, on the other their is the teacher's idea of how the end product should look like. Summer projects should be student-designed because this would allow for students to choose their projects, making them better, although they may not know exactly what they will be learning in the coming year.

If students are allowed to choose their projects, they will be better. During summer break, students like to relax and do activities they are interested in. If they have to do a school project, they may not mind as much if it is something they are passionate about. This interest in what they are doing would cause them to make a better project, rather then if they had to just do a project they were assigned to. This could also allow for further learning caused by the project since they would be looking up new information. It could also have students remember what they have learned longer because it is something they take interest in. Students who are allowed to do projects they chose will make a better project that has also enhanced their learning.

One problem that might arise with a student-designed project is that they might not have full knowledge of the course material they will be learning after the summer. While their project might be very good, and they may have learned a lot of new information, they may not have learned or gone over the topics that will be discussed in class. They may have also not completed the project to the particular standards their new teacher has. While it may be a valid concern that students might not complete the project to the exact standards of the teacher, it is still preferable for students to design their own projects. If the teacher or school designs the projects, it may cause disinterest in the students to complete the project altogether. Also, while the student's projects might not be exactly what the teacher hoped for, they would accomplish the stated goal of continuing their learning over the summer. It could also give the teacher an opportunity early on in the year to correct the students where the may have gone wrong, and a rubric could be provided initially so students know how their project will be graded. Even though students might not know all of the course material they will be studying, they would still produce good projects and their projects would accomplish the stated goal of learning over the summer.

A self-designed project would make students more interested and thus more likely to learn over summer break. This would be preferable to a teacher-designed project because the teacher might assign a topic that is not interesting to the student and they might not learn or complete the assignment. If the topic is something the students are passionate about, then they will remember what they learned better then if they were assigned the project. It might also cause them to enjoy the project, which could increase their future desire for learning and being interested in school-related activities. Most students are under the impression that academic subjects are boring, but if they could complete a project that they enjoy, then this impression could be altered.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
29AB81B05092,"In some cases, just because it is summer break does not mean that students stop learning. Some schools require students to complete a project during their break from school. There has also been discussions about if the projects should be designed by the teachers or students. Having students come up with and design their own projects is a way for them to use their creativity and help them practice time management.

Student-designed projects allow the student to be as creative as they would like. Multiple students have claimed that assignments and projects led by their teachers tend to be boring and bland, letting students have control over their own work could make it more interesting and have them eager to complete the assignment. There is also the conflict of if a student plans to take a vacation during the summer, which could make it difficult for them to complete the project that was assigned, but if they had the freedom to choose then they should be able to complete it based on where they are. Having student-designed projects could be beneficial to teachers as well. The different projects could show teachers what students are interested in, what skills each student possesses, and the different levels of skills each students has.

A skill that everyone should strive to perfect is time management. Coming from multiple students and myself, lots of students tend to procrastinate on classroom assignments and wait to finish them at the last minute, but allowing students to work on something they are interested in would make them more eager to work on the assignment and have it complete before the deadline. Whether on a vacation or staying at home, student designed projects would allow them to choose what would work out for them and their schedule.

All in all, there are both pros and cons to student-designed projects. Some may argue that teacher-designed projects are easier for students because it will be assigned with instructions on how to complete it, which is a valid point, but just because it may be easier does not mean that students will be interested or eager to complete it. Student- designed projects allow students to be creative and work on time management skills while giving them freedom and opportunity to make their own decisions, like in the real world.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
CC50C8238771,"Imagine getting to design your own project for school during the summer! Students would have a lot of fun designing their own project! Students would get to enjoy their summer, while doing a school project in a fun way because they were allowed to design it themselves! Summer projects that are required from the school, should be student-designed because students would learn to be more responsible, students already have to do what the teachers assign them do during the school year, and students would have more fun with the school project if they got to design it themselves. Summer projects that are required from the school, should be student-designed.

Firstly, summer projects that are required from the school should be student-designed because student would learn to be more responsible. Students would have to come up with their project on their own, so that would make them more responsible because students are used to teachers planning the work and the format of projects. This would also give students the opportunity to show their teachers and parents what they are capable of doing on their own. If students got to design their own projects, then they would have to take it seriously because its up to them and their grade will reflect how well they did. Designing their own projects would help them become more responsible and that is good to learn at a younger age for the future.

Secondly, students already have to do what the teachers assign them to do during the school year, so I think that students should get to do what they want to do for their project during their break. Students summer break should be their time because thats their break away from school, so they should get to design their own project. It's good to give students more freedom because that makes students happier and it makes people feel good knowing that they get to design what they want to do instead of always having to do what the teachers want them to do. Students would have more confidence in themselves if they got to design their own project because students are used to having to reach a certain level to be approved or get a good grade. Students are used to doing what teachers want them to do during the school year, so students should at least get to do what they want to do during their break away from school.

Lastly, students would have more fun with school projects if they got to design it themselves. I personally like designing my own things because it shows who I am instead of having to do what what other people want me to do. The information would stay in the students brain longer if they designed something on their own to help them remember the topics. Students are very creative and smart, but sometimes students dont get to show that because they are expected to do things exactly how the teachers want them to do things to get a good grade. Students would have more fun with learning if they got to design their own things and it would help them remember the information.

Summer projects that are required for the summer should be student-designed. Students would have a lot more fun with school projects during the summer if they got to design it themselves. Students are capable of so much and I dont think that they get to show that sometimes because they always have to do what others want them to do. If students got to design their own projects, then that would help them in the future because they would learn how to be responsible. Students normally have to follow the teachers orders, so I think in the summer, students should have their own freedom when it comes to school because summer is the students break away form school. Students would have more fun with learning school information if they got to choose their own design and style of learning.

130F9B6DCCF9,"Having good guidelines and being told what the expectations are will give students a better chance at success. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because the rules and expectations act as a rubric for students to follow, as well as making sure the project is acceptable to the teachers requirements.

The rules and guidelines should be clearly stated to assure the expectations of the teacher are met. On social media there are examples of students who have found a loophole in the directions in order to do less work. For example there is this one person who had to write an essay, topic is unknown. There was one rule that was not clearly stated, that being the font and size, the student used that missing rule to their advantage and used a font made up of shapes, something unreadable. As a student I know that students tend to find a way out of work, setting expectations will give students less of a chance to get out of work.

Giving student guidelines are very helpful in getting the project done. In my experience not all the projects I have gotten have all the guidelines. This leaves me stuck. The guidelines help me determine what material I need to research and how much of it. Sometimes it might even be that I dont know what kind of product I am making to convey that said research. This not only provides lack of a acceptable project but also not giving good guidelines gives unwanted stress towards the student. For example some students I know worry that their project is not good enough to meet the expectations of the teacher, or that they are not doing the work that is wanted. Giving guidelines will provide less stress for the student and with that a better outcome with their project.

With a teacher designed project the teacher can assure that the student is learning the material that is needed. Most classes follow a curriculum schedule that the teacher need to follow. Without the teacher giving the project the student might not learn the things required or not learn enough for the curriculum. When I had an online class my online teacher was very good. She provided me with enough guidelines that I was able to learn the material needed for me to pass the class. Having the teacher design the project will make sure that the student learns the material required for the curriculum.

With a teacher-designed project the rules and expectations act as a rubric for students to follow, as well as making sure the project is acceptable to the teachers requirements. If the project was to be designed by the students, there are too many easy ways out. Students can not give themselves the material needed to pass and some students could give themselves projects that are under the expected requirements of the teacher.

Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed?. This is actually a very interesting prompt, in my opion i feel like students should come up with there own summer project ideas because it forces the students to stretch there brain an and do research to complete there summer project, which keeps the brain active because the students have to plan out and do the project.

I feel as tho assigning a summer project that you have to come up with is reasonable for example when i was in elementary school i never wanted to do the big packets of work because i felt like they gave to much work out for it to be a summer break, so i stop doing them but when i was sighed to do the stem science fair i always did them because i like the fact that i could work on something that interest me. Also students tend to want to work on stuff that is self-designed then something the teacher has made for them especially when it comes to a project plus its less stress on the teacher to come up with a projects for the whole class when its 30 student to a class room just let the students come up with it.

Another reason i prefer student design over teacher is because i feel like teachers find boring topics to give us projects on and if students have to do a project on there break they can at least let us pick what our project is based on. I use to think that giving work during the summer didnt make since but as i got older and higher grade in school i realized its only for the benefit of u so Ur brain can stay strong and wont forget that your still in school because not doing anything productive all summer then going back to school is stressful it makes me feel like im in Pre K all over again.

In conclusion im with student-design not just because im a student myself but because it benefits students it helps keep there brain strong while there on break, its interesting to them and students will more likely do this because they picked it then doing what the teacher chose for there project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4

Those who disagree state teachers may give you more ideas and they can provide you with help for the design, but this is not true. Although some may disagree, students should design their own summer projects.

There are a variety of reasons students should design their own project. One reason is students can pick which design they want to do their project. They can decide on different ways to present their project. For example, students can choose to do a poster board, PowerPoint, or even a sheet of paper. Also students can take their time. Students will not have to feel rushed by their teacher. They can do their project when they want to and have time to do other fun activities during the summer. In addition, students can be more creative. Students can make their project as colorful as they want. They can provide their own ideas, design, and special features if they want.

There are more reasons why students should design their own project. For instance, there aren't as many rules or regulations to follow. Students can decide what they want to do. They can do anything they want to the project without any say from the teacher. Also, students would have to use more brain power. Since the teacher does not pick the design for them they have to do whats best for them. Students will not have their teacher always helping them and giving them answers. However, it can also be easier. Students will not have to abide by their teacher commands for the design. Its more beneficial for students by picking their own design.

27910796A7B1,"Summer break, the break every student looks forward to. No school meaning sleeping in, no school work, late nights out, more adventures, but also forgetting most of what they learned in school. Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break but, they do not know if these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Although teachers have the best interests, if the students designed their own projects they could come to an agreement on what their projects would consist of. Students should be able to chose their own project design because it is likely the project will take up most of their summer and with this in mind they should also be having fun.

Firstly, the students can come to an agreement of what each of their projects will consist of or if it is an individual design they can use their own creativity to design a project. By doing so there is a more likely chance the students will get their projects done. They wouldn't have to nag about doing something they have no interest in doing. These students would be able to express their interests in an academic way making the project easy to handle.

Another thing to consider is, this project will most likely be worked on most of their break. During summer break a lot of traveling is done. If the student is aware they will be traveling they could chose to base their project on where they might be traveling. While a teacher might have the projects include items some students might not have access to, with the student's design they would be able to work with what they have. The students should not have to stress about getting the project done, rather having fun with it while on break.

Lastly, the students should be able to have fun with this since it is their summer break. They could push themselves to try something new. Just how in the fifth grade science fair each student choose what their experiment was going to be. The kids had fun with the volcano explosion while learning that mixing baking soda and vinegar would make a bubbly explosion. They have fun while learning and who knows they might even find a new hobby.

On the other hand some schools worry that the students will forget what they learned or stop learning through out summer break. They have now required students to complete a summer project.

6E6D32164A61,"Summer, a break from school and a time to kick back and relax. For most at least. Some schools are requiring student to do some type of project over the summer to insure the they are expanding their education outside of their standard education. The main debate is whether the administrators or students decide on what the project is on. A student designed project is optimal for many reasons, for intense, being self motivated during the project, being able to freely choose the style or design of the project, and to let them express their sense of creativity. These three reasons are why student designed project are immensely better than administrators picking them, and to insure the student have the best, fun filled summer they can.

The first reason is self motivation, the whole point of summer is to have a break from school work and its projects. Students arn't going to be very motivated if the teachers give them a boring project to do during their break. By allowing student to pick their own projects it gives them motivation towards their work, because it creates reason to their assignment. Relating to reason, it also lets them pick a project that relates to themselves. By choosing something that relates to you, its no longer a project, it becomes more personal. It becomes something that the students really have to think about to find the answer. With that, they can pick a good interesting topic that they can easily stay focused on throughout the events of summer. Having motivation is crucial in everything, not just in school, to stay on task and to do what you enjoy.

Next, allowing students to choose their projects lets them choose the style of the project. Doing this allows students to choose the style, format, design, and other parameters of the project. Students can design their assignment in a way that they wont get board of doing. Having fun is what summer is all about, why not have a little fun while doing their project. They can decide if they wasnt a easy project or one that would make them critically think about what they are making. Finally, it allows them to plan out the project as they wish and on their own time. this creates time management skill, because summer is typically a busy time with many distractions, however if students create there own form of project they can carefully plan out days to work on it and achieve completion.

And lastly, creativity. This is the most important thing to learn at a young age, because not many people have it. Letting student assign their own project definitely creates creativity, it makes them think outside of the box and do things they normally wouldnt, like creating their own personal project over the summer. it lets them think for themselves for once instead of just having work assigned by the teacher in the regular school year, it makes them think for themselves. And most importantly, it prepares them for the real world. In the workplace your most likely not just going to have assignments with specific regulations to follow, no, you are going to have to get crafty and create a solution. We need people like that in our world today, and thats what students need to develop at an early age by say, designing their own project over the summer rather an administrator designing it.

In conclusion, a student designed project is clearly better when weighting out the options. It allows the students to be self motivated, by letting them pick a topic for themselves. They can pick a style that best fits them and their interest. Lastly makes a more creative person when say and done, because it makes them go out of there comfort zone and think outside of the box. And most importantly, to have fun while doing it because after all, isnt that what summers all about.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
BB009CEC8D8F,"Summer vacation is a time where many students travel, have fun, or simply relax. Many times students have to do school work in order to continue their learning process. The best way to continue their learning process during break is with student-designed projects. Although teacher- designed projects are more organized and simple to follow, student- designed projects enhances their thinking and organizational skill. When students create their own projects it becomes easier for them to fit in their schedule. With them being able to create their own projects, it also allows them to enjoy what they are doing.

To begin, student-designed projects makes it easier for students to fit in their busy schedule. A good amount of students are really busy during break, for example, many students travel or are in competative sports. Some, during travel, do not have easy access to utensils they might need for reasearch during a teacher-designed project. Student- designed projects allows them to do general research like, interviewing someone from france, or looking at a famous painting. It will not over complicate or stress students during ,or returning from travel. It makes it easy to commute with students who have busy schedules.

Secondly, it will also allow them to enjoy the project. Many teacher based projects are about topics students do not like, or are intrested in. With student-designed projects are free to choose what interest them the most. It does not just allow them to have fun but also lets them embrace their own personalities, For example, projects can be about music, art, sports, or even diversity it self. Things will be less difficult for students and will bring a sense of diversity to each individual project. Student-designed projects will allow them to have fun and embrace themselves while doing it.

To conclude, Summer vacation is one of the best vacations in school. Sometimes students are put in charge of completing tasks while on vacation, to ensure that they continue to learn. Student- designed projects are the best way of doing so. It makes it easier for students with busy schedules and allows them to enjoy what they are doing. Summer vacation is a time to have fun, so why not contiune the fun with student-designed projects.        ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6

With student-designed summer projects, the students would be able to design a project that is fit for their personal preferences, and that differentiates with the rest of their peers. The students would be able to let their creativity flourish throughout the project, and the students would ultimately enjoy completing the project. Student-designed summer projects would allow students to show their true colors while also learning and having fun, which leads me to my next point.

The summer projects should be student designed, because students would be able to have fun while learning. When teachers design projects for their students, they are mostly professional with no creativity or differentiation. However, if students were allowed to design their own summer project, it is likely that the students would make the project fun in their own way, and as enjoyable as possible. Students would be able to have fun showing their personality in their project, while also learning in an entertaining way, which would likely motivate them more to complete the project, leading me to my final point.

The summer projects should be student-designed, because students would be more motivated to complete the project if it is from their design, making it easier for them. When students are assigned teacher-designed projects, most students tend to procrastinate on it because they know how boring it is, since teachers tend to make projects strictly on the topic, or subject they are learning with no differentiation. However, if students were assigned a summer project that they can personally design, the students would likely be more motivated to complete the project. A student-designed summer project would allow the students to use their creativity and make their project fun and filled with their personality. This would ultimately motivate the students to complete the project because they know what it is about and they are able to maneuver it in their own way, making it enjoyable for them and their personal preferences.

Critics will argue that allowing the students to design their own summer projects would decrease the efficiency of their learning since the project is not designed by an educated professional. However, having the students design their own summer project and making them be creative in their own way by designing it, allows them to learn in their personalized way and determine how to learn efficiently while also fitting with their personal preferences. Although teacher-designed projects contain more efficient information, allowing the students to learn more efficiently, giving students access to design their own summer projects allows them to be creative and different from their peers, which ultimately allows them to show their true colors in a fun way while still learning. Students should be allowed to design their summer projects in order for them to be creative, have fun while learning, and to motivate them more to complete their personally designed project.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
2321FAC1E823,"Summer break can lead to a fallback in students' learning from the previous year. In order to combat this problem, many schools have projects for the students over summer break to ensure that students maintain the skills that they learned in school. Some of these projects might require a lot of work, while others are less labor intensive. However, one thing is true for all of these projects. They should be student designed because this insures that the students will be engaged with the project, gives teachers a better understanding of what students are passionate about, and is the most fair way to give students work over a break.

Having students design their own projects will ensure that the project is something that the students actually enjoy doing. Firstly, because they have choice in what they do, the students will be able to pick a subject or manner of presentation that they are excited about. If the teacher were to assign the same project to every student without allowing the students to have any say in what they actually end up doing, there would defiantly be students who are not interested in the project. Secondly, the students will also understand the project better. The students will have designed their own project, so they will know exactly what the outcome is supposed to be like and how to get there. Many projects are hard for students because they are not actually aware of what they are intended to do, so by allowing the students to design their own project, the school ensures that the students will completely comprehend it. Lastly, having the project be designed by students means that the students will be given more opportunity for creativity. Because the students more liberty over their project, they will be able to use more of their own unique ideas in the project.

Allowing students to design their own project is also better for the teachers. First of all, the teachers responsible for grading the project will be given an opportunity to better understand their students before the school year ever starts. This understanding is because students are allowed to express themselves more through a project they designed themselves. Secondly, the teachers will not have to worry about making different projects for different levels of students, or about having to make a project that will interest many different types of students because the students will be responsible for making the project work for their level of understanding and interests. Lastly, the teachers will be provided a time to learn things that they would not have a chance to learn otherwise. This is because the students are given the opportunity for creativity, so they may choose to do a project about something that a teacher may have know previous knowledge of.

Allowing students to design their own summer projects is a more fair way to assign work over the summer holiday. To begin, the students have been completing teacher designed work all school year, so it is only fair to give the students a break and allow them to design their own projects. Additionally, the projects are assigned as work over the summer, so they should not feel like the same work that students are being assigned all year long. Because the students have been working very diligently over the year to complete many different types of assignments from teachers. It would not be fair to the students to essentially continue that trend of assignments into the vacation. Finally, a student designed projects allows for more flexibility. This flexibility allows the students the opportunity to create a project that will be conducive to a busy summer schedule. Many students have to travel or go to summer camps, so they mightn not be able to complete to work which a teacher who does not know the summer plans of a students designs. However, it the student designs their own project, they will be able to make it work with their summer schedule.

If a school assigns a summer project to their students, the project should be student designed. there re many different ways to continue learning when formal school is on a break, but a student designed project will allow for creativity, flexibility, and be better for teachers as well as students. Above all, schools should focus on educating students in a way that allows them creating and ensure that they are passionate about what they learn, if not students will never develop a life long love of education.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
E04915C5EF0F,"If you asked any student to teach the current class subject is, the lesson would not be smooth or effective. However, if the teacher was to teach the subject, the lesson would be smooth and effective. The same goes for summer projects. Summer projects should be teacher designed because teachers have an elevated understanding of the curriculum and have more experience with learning based projects, which make the projects more effective.

Firstly, teachers have more of an understanding of the curriculum because it is their job to plan and teach it to the students. Therefore, teachers have the ability to create a project that studies important or nuanced portions of their subject. Backed with superior expertise, the teacher's project will be better at guiding students towards understanding important topics. The teacher's better understanding of the curriculum will allow them to create a project that not only explores the surface of the topic, but one that can delve into the finer details.

Secondly, teachers have more experience teaching new subjects and topics to their students. Teachers understand the methods to teach students their subject because they have experience with the subject and teaching. Their experience allows them to create projects that present a topic in a manageable and understandable manner.

Proponents of student designed projects may argue that student designed projects will make students more passionate about the project. Although students may be more passionate, the construction of the project will be less efficient and lack teacher expertise, which may lead to failures in the project's effectiveness.

A teacher's superior subject understanding and teaching experience will lead to a better and more effective project than one built from a student's understanding and lesser teaching experience; summer projects should be designed by teachers.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
5C7D43A28B7A,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should students be the ones designing their projects or should it be their teacher? If students had the opportunity to create their own project it would let them obtain higher benefits then if the teacher were to make it. As anyone knows summer is a time of fun where children get to splash around in the pool, have water gun fights, and to hangout with their friends. So by letting the students choose their projects it makes it easier on them. The advantages are high if this happens because, the students get to choose what they want to learn, make if fun for themselves, and not having to cram if the teacher gave them some thing difficult to do over the summer break.

It more or so depends on the subject the student is getting the project from, say if the student gets the project from their math teacher why not let them do a coloring project with Math using formulas or to keep it simple and easy and do a few questions every other day to keep the mind steady. Maybe in English the students could recommend a book they would like to read and they would write about their favorite thing about said book. In science the students could do bird watching as their project, as many birds are coming back from the south they could learn more about the animals that fly high in the sky and gain knowledge about their habits and niches,the students can also find new birds they never knew about in their general area which might be a cool an new thing for them and their family to try out.

If a student had the option to design their own project they would choose some thing along the lines of the examples provided in paragraph two. It would be between these main three fun, quick and easy. It's mainly up to the student if they decide to do that they might want to make hard on themselves and give themselves a challenge, but thats what makes it fun for everyone because the students get to decide how they want to make and do their project.

So in conclusion, by letting the students choose their projects it makes it easier on them. It gives them the opportunities they need to succeed, the students get to choose what they want to learn, make if fun for themselves, and still get to have a great summer vacation.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
98944F234E6B,"Summer break is around 3 months and in that time, kids our age go on vacations, play video games, work, go out, ect. Some kids still test themselves over the summer like going to an arts academy or a different subject academy to get them ready for the future. Other kids might not see collage as their future and go into full time work after they graduate high school. I think the student can decide whether or not they'd be interested in working on a project in the summer. It wouldnt be a lot of work but maybe some type of project the kids would be passionate about and want to learn or present that subject.

The project should be student-designed and one of the reasons should be, what are they doing over the break?

depending on the subject the teacher can ask them to make a project including either what they learned that year or something that correlates to that subject. The kids should be able to have fun, still learning, and do a project in their own style and use their creativity. The teacher can steer them in the right direction of help them with ideas but I still think the student should really pick on what they'd like to do. If the teacher assigned the project to the kids I wouldn't think it would be exiting to do, especially over summer break. I'd have so much more fun if I got to choose what I get to write or present about than for a teacher to give me limited creativity and how they'd want it done. You can see when a kid is really passionate about a project compared to a kid who just wants to get it over with, that being said when its student-designed it really has no limit on what they can do. We can have fun with our projects and the teacher will hopefully enjoy them after the break. The project and show, what school subject it is, what did I choose to present that subject, how they go together, and how the school subject taught me about their subject(what they chose). I believe it should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed so the student can really be engaged in the learning process.

This does depend on the subject or how the kid is doing academically, i'd say the teacher should design the project if the kid is failing the class, also depends on what they are planning for the future. If the kid is struggling the teacher should step in and figure out a project that might motivate the student into learning more about the subject.

For the most part I think if the student has to complete a project over the break than they should have some fun with it and show their teacher the potential they have. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
BBF72645C803,"In some schools students are required to do projects over summer break to ensure their students are still learning. While most students will tell you this sounds like the punishment of the century, there is a way to make this experience fun for students. If they can design their project it gives them countless opportunities and ways to succeed. Most students enjoy learning when it is something they're interested in the subject. If students are given the freedom to design their own project, then they will be more interested, have the freedom to be creative, and have the opportunity to complete the project by learning in a way which is most effective to them.

Having students design their own projects gives them the opportunity to learn about what they're interested in. To some students going to a museum may be super fun and to others it may be getting lifeguard certified. Both are terrific learning experiences, but display completely different interests. Students overall are more likely to do their work and be invested in projects they are interested in. It can be argued that giving students control over their projects will make them much harder to grade. While this is true, giving a student a chance to do a project on something they are passionate about is a much better learning experience than having them write a research paper on information that is not applicable to their life and does not interest them. Giving students the ability to design their own projects lets them research things they are interested in, making learning more fun for them.

Everyone learns in a different way. This is information schools have known for years. Giving students the opportunity to design their own projects provides freedom to learn however is best for them. If they learn best from lectures, they can take a class. If they learn best hands on, they can go out into the world and do whatever they choose for their subject. The possibilities are endless. Many would say it is much easier to standardize these projects, and while this is accurate, giving the students the freedom in this project will give them the opportunity to experience new types of learning and comprehend the information they are receiving better, because they are learning in the way best suited for them.

Giving this choice to students provides them with the opportunity to design their project in a way that highlights their strengths. Students are very creative people whether it be in art, writing, sciences, or any other subject. For example, if a student is interested in chemistry, they could do anything from creating organic sunscreen to baking. This not only is more engaging for the students, but having fun while doing the project makes the chances much higher of them retaining the information they are learning. While this would not be very organized, the goal is to have students retain the information and learn.

If one of my teachers was to tell me I had to do a project on my summer vacation, I would be furious. However, if I had the opportunity to design it myself, that anger would turn to acceptance fairly quickly. If students are going to be forces to do a project on their vacation, they should have the freedom to design it. This would keep students interested and invested. Giving students the freedom to design their own project will result in more interest, more creativity, and the opportunity to complete the project by learning in a way which is most effective to them.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
070148989D83,"In some schools, students are required to complete summer projects to continue learning over their break. These summer projects insure that students enter the school year prepared for learning, and have an easier adjustment to the start of school. When these summer projects are student-designed, it gives the students opportunities to explore a wide range of topics that wouldn't normally fall in school curriculum, and learn about something they are passionate about and enjoy doing it. This is why summer projects should be designed by students, not by teachers.

When students are given the opportunity to explore topics of their own choice, they have a chance to learn something that doesn't fall within the typical curriculum of schools. In schools, the main subjects taught are Math, History, Science and English. When students aren't limited to these basic subjects, it allows them to research something that may not be covered in school. If a student is interested in cooking, but there are no cooking classes at their school, they could choose to learn about it over the summer. The student-designed projects also give students a chance to take control of their learning and direct their projects themselves. Students are able to choose the direction that they want to take their project in. They could present their learning in an essay, virtual presentation, or even in a work of art. This freedom allows the student to customize their project, therefore being more interested in it. When given the responsibility of choosing their own summer project topics, students are able to choose something with significance to them and show their work in individual ways, keeping them interested in their projects.

When summer projects are student-designed, it gives students the opportunity to center their projects around something that fascinates them, which keeps them interested and makes them put in more effort. When schools give out summer work, one big issue that they face is that it is most likely about a topic that students aren't interested in. This leads students to feel bored with their work, and put in less effort. When students are giving the freedom to lead their own projects, they can choose something they like. When they do this they put in more effort, and work harder on it because they are passionate about it. When projects are student led, and they choose their own directions of work, this gives them a chance to learn something from their project, not just work to fulfill guidelines. I once had a summer project to read a book, and it was a book that I was not interested in at all. This led me to just read and write a paper about it for a grade, not to learn. If I had been able to choose something that I was passionate about, I would have been able to learn something from it, and not just work to fulfill guidelines for a paper. A current problem that schools face is that children only work for grades, not to learn and retain information. when students can lead their own projects, they will put in more work because they are passionate about what they are doing and therefore learn information instead of working just for a grade.

When students are restricted to teacher-designed projects, they feel trapped in the guidelines for the project and end up not enjoying the projects. This makes them more likely to put off the assignment to the last minute, which leads to them performing poorly on it. When students are limited to guidelines on a project and don't have the opportunity to customize their project, they end up enjoying it less. When it comes to a summer long project, if a student doesn't enjoy what they are doing it can end up spoiling their summer. When students don't feel passionate about a project and don't have the opportunity to have input on it, they are more likely to put it off to the last minute. if they do this, odds are they will end up doing poorly on it. When I was given the task of reading a book over the summer, it was on a subject that I had no connection to and didn't want to read about. I ended up putting it off till the last week, because I was dreading it so much. This meant that I spent the last week of my summer reading about something that I disliked. When students have the freedom to design their own projects, they can choose something that they enjoy, which makes them less likely to put it off to the minute and do poorly on it.

As our schools face an ongoing struggle of keeping kids interested in their work, student-designed summer projects could be a start to foxing this problem. When students choose the direction of their projects, they aren't restricted to certain topics. This allows them to choose something they are passionate about. This makes them more likely to enjoy their project and actually learn from it.          ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
1F7997582855,"I don't believe that we should have a project over the summer, because that is the time of our break. But the question is should the projects be teacher-designed or student-designed. I believe that if a teacher assigns a summer project it should be teacher-designed. The teacher is the one who knows what they want on the project and knows all of the checkpoints they want the students to mark during the project. The student may also not know exactly how to do the project and if they have a template for them from the teacher it would be easier for them to answer the questions.

When a teacher assigns a project to any class they know what they want the project to be and how they want it done. It would not be fair to the students if the project was student-designed and the project isn't what the teacher is looking for. The student could end up getting a bad grade on the project and it could disrupt their GPA for the rest of the school year since projects are usually a big percentage of your grade. There was this one teacher I had back in sixth grade who went into great detail about every project he gave us. All of the things he did were teacher-designed because he knew exactly what he wanted us to do for every project. We had a template of what we we're suppose to do and every time all of the class did good on our projects because we knew what he wanted from us.

Another reason that projects should be teacher-designed is because the student may not know exactly what the teacher wants them to do on the project. Back in third grade my teacher gave us a project on the different types of clouds. She never went any further with her explanation, she just ended it there so the class and I assumed that we knew what she meant when she said it. She told us we could do it however we wanted to. I went to the store and found some cartoon pictures of clouds that I could staple to the poster boards and put big letters over the various clouds. A few of the other kids had the same idea as me. When we presented our projects our teachers said that we had to actually make the clouds ourselves and not just buy some drawings that someone else made because it was plagiarism even though the watermarks of the person who made it was still on it. Most of us ended up getting an F on the project until we did the entire thing over again. This is why we need teacher-designed projects because we need to know exactly what they want us to do for the project.

These are the reasons why I think that projects over the summer or otherwise should be teacher-designed. The teacher knows what they want from the project and if they know what they want they should tell us. The student is the one who doesn't know what the teacher wants from their project and the student may not understand what the teacher is asking of them and may need a template for the project. Some may disagree and say that a student-designed project is better especially over the summer because they may not be able to get into contact with the teacher if they have a question so the teacher should let them reign free to do what they want on the project. I think that if the teacher gives out a clear template of what they want from the project then the student should be able to follow the template and complete the project successfully.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
618DF148C39F,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their time away from school. I argue that these summer projects be student-designed instead of teacher-designed. They should be student-designed because it tells the teacher what the student actually learned throughout the school year, and makes the student go at their own pace instead of feeling rushed.

Having a student design their own project shows what they have learned throughout the school year. If a teacher was to design a project for a class of students, most of them will not even try. Most of them would try to find ways to finish the project without showing that they had learned anything during the school year. But having a student design their own project shows that they have learned something during the school year, and had a decent knowledge of what they had learned. Also a student-designed project will make the student not feel rushed.

Having a student-designed project will make the student go at his or her pace. When a teacher makes a project for a class, theres most likely a rubric that the students must follow and a deadline of when the project must be turned in. Most students will feel rushed and will not put their maximum effort into doing the project on their own, and will probably try to cheat or copy of the internet. But having students design their own projects, they set their own rubric and follow their own deadline of when to get it done. When going at their own pace students will show their maximum effort into their project.

Summer projects are required by some schools to assure that the students had learned something from the previous year and to continue their learning for the following year. It will tell the teacher what the student had learned and may need help on. Also it will also make the student not feel rushed when he or she was making the project. Giving a student the chance to design their own project will show self-advocacy and how independent they are. Therefore, I believe that summer projects should be student-designed rather that teacher-designed.             ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
B527F1CEBDA4,"Generic_Name wakes up to realize that he has still not turned in his submission for the summer project. He is stressed out with the work needed to be done and decides to rush it in order to turn it in, but it turns out horrendous and he cannot do the project he wished on doing during the summer. Some schools require that students must complete summer projects, and these projects are either teacher-designed or student-designed. Even though some schools may argue that student-designed summer project are superior because the students have more control on the topic for the summer, but schools should have teacher-designed summer projects because they provide better education for the students, less stress for the students, and better grading for the students.

To begin, school based summer project summer projects should be teacher-based because it provides a better education for the students. For example, normal school project are mainly chosen by the teacher due to their superior intellect. The reason why teachers mainly choose the topic is because they are the ones teaching it and have more experience with the topic they teach. Another example, is when students choose the topic of a project, but it tends to be slightly off topic, which tarnishes their intellect. The reason behind this is because they do not contain the same intellect as their teachers and know a minuscule amount the topic compared to them. Thus concluding that a summer project would not be as challenging to the student's mind if students had the choice to design their project.

Secondly, school based summer project summer projects should be teacher-based because it provides less stress for the students. For example, normal school projects chosen by the teacher are not as stressful. This is due to teachers knowing their topic and choosing a project that will challenge the student's mind, but will still remain not too stressful. On the other hand, if student had the choice to choose their topic it would be stressful to them, this happens because students have multiple tasks at hand during school like paying attention in class and studying. This ends up in not having the time to choose a topic in their interest and would just rush it and it would end up being horrendous. Thus concluding that it would end up in stressing the students out more than inspiring them.

Finally, school based summer project summer projects should be teacher-based because it provides better grading for the students. For example, after a project designed by a teacher is done the students must turn it in to be easily graded. This happens because the teacher is the one who designed it and knows how to critique it. On the other hand, a project designed by a students being grading is difficult compared to one made by a teacher. This is due to the teacher not knowing what to grade when viewing a student-designed project, and can often result in a worse grade that what it was worth. Thus concluding that grading a project is easier when it was designed by a teacher.

In conclusion, summer project designed by teachers are overall superior because they provide better education for the students, less stress for the students, and better grading for the students. If schools allow students to partake in the designing of the summer projects it will end up hurting the students more than it helps. You can help out by informing teachers for them to design the project in order not to harm your grade.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
5F1314EFC0BF,"Many schools use summer projects to insure that students are still learning during summer break. Some people would say these projects should be designed by the teachers. Whereas others would say the projects should be designed by the students. For many reasons, summer projects should be designed by the teachers.

Teachers are more organized in their planning. If a student organizes a summer project then there would not be a project to turn in, because some students are irresponsible and dont even know how to put together a project and will not ask for someone to teach them. Teachers would also be able to control what the projects about, how its going to be made, and when its going to be turned in. If a student decides what the project is about, how its going to be made, and when to turn it in then the teachers when school starts would have a very unorganized load of unknown projects to grade.

Projects are much easier for teachers to grade if the projects are on one subject. If a student is able to design his or her own project then there would be many topics that don't even match what the class is for. Letting a student design a summer project would be like letting a student design their own test and giving it to the teacher to grade. Then the teacher would have to find the answers to the test, make an answer sheet, and grade over two hundred individualized papers. Thats why teachers make their own test for the students to take so that the teachers have one test to grade it wont take hours to grade it will take minutes.

Some may say by letting the students organize and plan their own summer project would help boost their imagination. Though thats true, letting the teachers make a creative project would also boost the students imagination. Teachers need to be able to grade the papers which goes back to organization. A student can be creative when doing the project but when actually designing the project, teachers have to have a subject for the students to do the project on. Otherwise the teachers for summer reading would have to read every book a student has read over the summer instead of assigning just one book for everyone to read, or even in history class if a teacher just hands out a project with no subject then the student could easily do the project on something they haven't even learned.

It is the teachers job to give the student something to do. It is not the teachers job to overwhelm the students with designing their own project. If a teacher can design and give out home work then they should also be able to design and give out summer project for students to do. Teachers are not paid to sit in their chair and say "" Theres a project, figure it, out have a good summer.""

D0050F9D9621,"Students across the nation often spend their year day dreaming about the summer break, but when they are assigned summer assignments by their teachers, their dreams may feel crushed. Teachers are mostly the ones that create these assignments, but is that the best way to do it? If students were able to design their own summer assignments it might just take some of the weight off their shoulders while completing it. Summer assignments should be student-designed because it will motivate them to complete it, encourage them to be creative, and cater to the minds of the students.

If the students are the ones creating their project, they would be more motivated to complete it. When kids are having fun over the summer they do not usually stop and think about their school work, but if they were to design it, it may spark more interest for them. Students putting their own personal touch on to their assignment would make it less like work and more like fun. Teachers often assign large packets full of information, but by doing so, their students will procrastinate this long chore. Students are more likely to create an interactive and less detail packed assignment. Summer is a time for students to have a break from school, and when they get to make their projects themselves, it makes them not feel burdened about completing it.

When kids are given the task of designing themselves a summer project, they will most likely think more creatively than their teachers. Younger people are known to have a better creativity than their older counterparts. When students collaborate, their minds all put together should create a very interesting outcome. Their ideas would likely be more interactive than information driven. With more interactive projects, kids would also be creative while completing the project. Creativity increases effort which results in better grades. Teachers may think that their content filled assignments will benefit their students academics, but the truth is that kids need room for creativity in order to absorb information.

Perhaps the most important reason students should design their summer assignments is because it would cater to their own minds. The students are the ones that are completing these assignments, so they should know what is best for them. Students know what kinds of assignments weigh them down and which don't. They would create projects that a relevant to their lives. Teachers were all students at one point, but times change very quickly. What was once helpful to a teacher, may no longer be helpful for student in the present. A student-designed project would be made with their best interests in mind. Kids will design their projects to what fits best for them over the summer.

All in all, students should design their own summer assignments because they will be more likely to complete it, they would put more thought into it, and they know what is best for themselves. Teacher-designed projects may have quality information, but students are not often inclined to do heavy work loads over the summer. Since students are the ones that have to complete their projects, they should be the one that design it. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8

Some bealive that it should be teacher designed because it's done the format teachers want, have students working on the same topic, and can help a student get interested in a topic. However, I bealive it should be student designed because students can do research on topics they enjoy, they don't like the teachers topic, and can be more creative. That is why it should be student-designed.

First, students like to do research on topics they have interest in. As a student I do better on projects where I do my own research on. Back in middle school I did a project of the wildlife in Virginia and, I felt that I could complete the project on time. Doing the project on wildlife in Virginia had me doing all types of research from online to reading books to get my information. I learned that the wildlife in Virginia is one of the most mind blowing places on the map of the United States.

Second, students are not interested on the topic teachers assign to them. Students will lack on the project and not give their best effort. Their was a survey conducted at a school asking students if they prefer their own topic or teachers topic. Seventy percent of students answered they prefer their own topic and thirty percent prefer the teachers topic. The seventy percent of students explained that it gives them a opportunity to do a project they like. Most students spend the entire school year doing projects on topics they're assign to. During the summer they should do a project on a topic of their interest.

The last reason is students can be more creative with projects. Most teachers want the students to complete the project in a certain way. With summer being two-three months long students can find other ways to do the project. Example would be a student can do his/her project on a power point instead of writing on it paper. another way that would be creative is do a video on your research. Students exploring ways to do their project can help them on the real world of working.

In conclusion the project should be student-designed for students to get the opportunity to be creative, do topics they enjoy, and not worry do the teachers topic. Students have all summer to complete the project on their own design. That is why the project should be student-designed.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
758A03587A0E,"Summer is a students time to relax and take a long break from the chaos that endures during the school year. This break is normally for beach trips and days at the pool with ones friends. Although, some schools make students complete projects over the summer to make sure they stay sharp and are prepared for the more difficult school year that lies ahead of them. These projects will either be designed by students or by a faculty member of the school district. These summer projects, most likely an already unwanted assignment, should be designed by the students for reasons that will make a difference in the long run of the students education like, students know students best, keeping work balanced, and getting rid of unnecessary work.

The first reason students should be the creators of these projects is because students know students best. When a teacher designs a projects sometimes they do not always know how kids will respond to the assignment and how that will effect what they are learning. For example if a student is excited for a project they are going to be more willing to finish it and will be more excited to learn about the material it is on, and students know what they like best and are able to create these assignments that will work in their benefit and will make them enthusiastic about what they are doing. Which in turn will make the project more effective towards their education and will end up helping the teachers. All in all, students know what they like best.

Another issue is with facility giving out these projects is they can sometimes overdue what they are giving out. This meaning students will be able to give out a balanced schedule for the other students to complete. For example they will have a set amount of work for two weeks and they will have deadlines within the break. This is not saying teachers cannot do this but students will be able to provide a fair amount of work for the others to do without the students feeling like they have too much to do over a short period of time. This will also in turn make the projects easier to digest for students and not overwhelm them when the time comes for them to start it.

The final reason it would be better for students to create this projects is because a lot of the time students feel that teachers give out work that is not necessary. I have seen this happen all of the time, teachers give out work that does not feel like it is helping with out education but there just to keep us busy or ""busy work"". The elimination of this work would be very beneficial to not only our time but our feelings toward the project and our eagerness to finish it. If we feel like we are doing work that does not benefit us in any way it does not make us enthusiastic about what we are doing and will only make us go into the school year feeling hostile that the teachers made us do that work. If students were creating the projects they would be able to almost eliminate this work entirely and keep it to only what we need to do. If a student feels they need more practice on a certain topic they would be able to provide that practice option without having everyone else do it if they do not need the practice.

In conclusion, if students were able to create these projects they would be able to reach the other students in a way that a facility member would not. Once again, students know students best. With students making these projects we would be able to change the feeling toward doing school work in the summer from a negative to possibly even a positive if done correctly. These summer projects, most likely an already unwanted assignment, should be designed by the students for reasons that will make a difference in the long run of the students education like, students know students best, keeping work balanced, and getting rid of unnecessary work. By the students, for the students.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
8058E20D84BF,"Growing up going to school, I always looked forward to summer break. It was my time to be free and to be a kid again. Going to the beach, family cookouts, and hanging out with friends are things I always looked forward to doing. Each summer would be better then the last. Until my mom got that call from my school, reminding her about our summer break project. She would bother me nonstop, asking me thousands of questions about it daily. Looking back to my past summers I never once did a student-designed project. If schools were to change summer projects to student-designed instead of teacher-designed students would do subjects that they are interested in resulting in more projects being completed and students would be able to pick a subject that they know they are good at rather then them doing something they have no experience with.

Throughout my years in school I never once did a summer project that I was truly interested in. Most projects made us read a certain book and summarize it in some unique way. Every summer, one after another, we did the same type of project. Over and over again, reading a book and summarizing it. Those projects started to get boring and some summers I didn't even do them. Students never got a choice with anything. We didn't get to choose what project we did, we didn't get to choose if we worked with a group, we didn't even get to choose what book we did our report on. If students were able to decide what we did for our summer break project the completion rate would increase dramatically. Students are getting tired of doing the same project year after year. Letting students decide what project they do would give them the option to pick subjects that they are interested in. Therefor, there would be a lot more effort and enthusiasm from the students. Overall, students would be a lot more excited to start working and complete the project. For example, if I was giving the opportunity to design my own project it would have something to do with baseball. I enjoy the game of baseball. I've been playing since I was five years old and I have loved every second of it. I promise, if I was able to do my project on baseball there is no way I'm getting anything lower then a one hundred. I know some teachers would say, ""We've tried to do more interesting projects and some students just aren't going to do them."" Just because you think something is interesting or exciting doesn't mean the person next to you does. Some teachers now-a-days have no idea what students enjoy.

In the past I have come across many assignments including projects, homework, and classwork that I have gotten terrible grades on because I had no idea what to do or what they were even talking about. When the teachers are designing the summer projects they are following the guidelines of their boss or school district. They don't think about how well the students know it. They don't think about the future and what the students grades are going to be. They think about one thing and one thing only, designing the project and designing it right. If students were able to design their summer project the grades would be so much better. I hate to say this but giving the students the privilege to design their own project would allow them to choose something that they have some understanding about. Students aren't going to pick a topic or subject that they have no knowledge or understanding in. That would just be foolish. For example, I'm not much of a reader so these summer projects can actually be pretty challenging for me. If I was able to create and design my own project I would do something about shoes. Shoes to me is almost like a passion or even a love. I have always enjoyed collecting shoes. I can tell you anything about any shoe model or any shoe company. Doing any project about shoes would honestly be a lot less challenging and I would have a better chance at a better grade. Teachers could say, ""These projects are simple, your just reading a book and answering easy questions."" What if some students can't actually read? What if some students just aren't good with English in general? Teachers need to stop categorizing all students and start looking at us one by one. Teachers should know each students strength one by one but they don't.

Summer break is a time for laughter and fun. Summer break is a break from school. Students shouldn't have to stress the fact that they have a project due on the first day of school. Specially a project that is challenging and overall boring. Teachers have no intent on making the projects interesting or easy for the students. They honestly just want to get it done so they can go on their break as well. Allowing students to design the summer break projects would be a step in the right direction.     ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
86D79F272847,"In discussions about whether summer projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed, one must first define the two terms. On the one hand, student-designed projects are defined as projects designed by the students. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects are defined as projects designed by the teachers. Although summer projects that are student-designed can be beneficial to the students, the advantages of teacher-designed projects outweigh the advantages of student-designed projects. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed.

Student-designed projects can be beneficial to the students, but the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. An advantage of student-designed projects is that the student will be more creative with their project, because it is designed by themselves. Therefore, students are more likely to complete the assignment. A disadvantage of student-designed projects is that the student will take advantage of the student-designed project and make it easier for themselves. The students will not challenge themselves, which will cause them to work less when they could be working harder. Consequently, the students will not learn over the summer. For example, if I was given a project over the summer that is student-designed I will most likely make it is easier for myself. Since it is summer break I would not want to do any type of difficult school work. Another disadvantage is that the students may not design a project that has to do with what they are supposed to be learning about. The students could easily go off topic. For example, if I were to be doing a summer project that is student-designed about history, which I should be learning about during summer break, I could easily go off topic and turn the history project into a science project. Therefore, summer projects should not be student-designed projects.

Teacher-designed projects are very beneficial to the students. The advantages of teacher-designed projects outweigh the disadvantages. An advantage of teacher-designed projects is that the teacher will challenge the students which will cause the students to work harder. The students will actually learn from the teacher-designed project since it is designed by the teacher. Another advantage of teacher-designed projects are that the teachers will design the right work for the students. The students will not go off topic since the teacher already has instructions for the students. A disadvantage of teacher designed-projects could be that students would probably not complete the assignment possibly because it could be difficult for the students to complete. The teachers may possibly make it difficult so the students could challenge themselves which is a good thing. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed.

In conclusion, the advantages of teacher-designed projects outweigh the advantages of student-designed projects. Schools should require students to complete projects that are teacher-designed so that it will assure that the students will continue to learn during their long summer break.                                                                              ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
E36560297AD9,"I'm sure most students would agree that teachers really know how to put you to work, while that sounds like a bad thing, it's actually very helpful. Teachers know how to drill information into a student's brain. However, I do understand why students would want to be in charge of organizing summer projects. Students want projects to be fun and easy, usually with as little work as possible, as to where teachers would more than likely want as much work as possible. Sure it can be difficult but, there are many reasons why teacher-designed summer projects would work better. Because teachers are more experienced with designing summer projects, they know what is needed to help students construct a great project. Teachers can also assist in giving pointers to how students can be more engaged with their projects. As difficult as it might seem, the challenges that teachers set for students, actually help benefit in teaching students the material.

Teachers have organized many summer projects throughout their years of teaching. They are more qualified to organize them because, they know what material students struggle with and they know how to make the information stick. Teachers have lots of experience with helping students create summer projects, therefore, should be the people who organize them. While the work may seem tedious and difficult at times, teachers are simply just trying to assist in helping you gain the knowledge and understand it. By giving students a lot of work, teachers are helping them learn not only the information being attained from the project but also, how to manage their time efficiently. Teachers understand that when students are working in a time frame, they have a better understanding of how to manage their time to work efficiently and get everything done before the due date. Experienced teachers can guide students in how to manage their time, get everything done, and still have time to spare. It is because of experienced teachers that students have been able to construct outstanding summer projects.

Teachers strive to engage their students in their work. If a student is engaged, they are more likely to succeed. Teachers engage students by designing summer projects in a way that interests them. A student who is engaged in their project is more likely to receive a good grade than a student who showed no interest in it at all. Teachers typically try to stick to things that inspire all students equally, they try not to lean towards a specific influence as to remain unbiased. Students have many different interests which is why student-organized projects would be beneficial. A teacher with a good understanding of their student's likes and dislikes can better organize a project that will help students be engaged. Keeping students engaged is a difficult, but manageable, task and while not every teacher can do it, they all try.

Challenges are another thing teachers set up for their students in attempt to help them better understand the material. Challenges can motivate students into working their hardest and trying their best. While some may argue that challenging work actually causes students to be less inclined to do summer projects, it actually motivates them more. Statistics show that students who are challenged receive better grades than those who are not. If students were to organize a summer project, they would more than likely leave out any form of a challenge, students would much rather have free time than work on a summer project and that would lead to students designing an easy summer project that requires little effort. Teachers on the other hand, give students lots of work so they can gain the information in a much better way. Summer projects aren't made to take up all your free time, they are made to make sure the information that was being taught during school actually stuck and that students fully understand it. Teachers who challenge their students are the teachers with the highest passing scores.

Teachers can organize a summer project better than students because they are highly experienced in doing so. Teachers find ways to engage and challenge their students which leads to a higher passing rate. So while student-designed projects can be fun and easy, it's more effective when summer projects are teacher-designed. The biggest problem with teacher-designed projects is that not every teacher or student is the same, However teacher-designed projects are said to be more successful than student-designed projects. They are not always fun, but they are always effective. Teachers are always working to help students gain information and be successful in life. So next time you have a summer project and you want it to be student-designed, think about all the things your teachers do to make sure you are going to be successful. It isn't supposed to be easy, and it isn't always going to be fun, but as long as you learn the information, it will always be beneficial.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
2A13367DF99F,"Summer projects are not a foreign idea to most highschoolers. Due to the fact that students forget what they learned in class over the summer, teachers will often assign work during vacation. This work is designed by the teachers, and typically covers some topic that the students will be learning about at the start of the new school year. These projects are considered by many to be an unavoidable slog which exists only to ruin their precious vacation; yet, some claim that allowing students to design their own projects would lessen this burden. These individuals say that giving students the freedom to choose the focus of their work would encourage a love for learning that may not be otherwise found in summer projects. Some dispute this claim, however, arguing that students are not capable of creating their own projects. Although some may argue otherwise, summer projects should be student-designed, as giving students the opportunity to manage their own projects is beneficial for developing their critical thinking skills and fostering independence.

When discussing how academic freedom affects students' critical thinking, it is important to consider in what ways such projects benefit these individuals. Summer projects are a thought exercise; therefore, allowing students to design their own projects provides them with a skill set that will stay with them into adulthood. Such activities teach students how to develop and execute original ideas, how to organize long term projects, as well as how to plan their assignment around an established deadline. In addition to teaching them important skills, student-designed projects are intended to stretch the limits of these students' mental abilities. Not only does this help to inspire a good work ethic in an individual, but it also leaves behind a love for academic study that cannot be found elsewhere.

The open ended nature of student-designed summer projects encourages independence among students, both in thought and in action. Although teacher-designed projects are intended to be guiding, they are often limiting in the content they aim to cover. Assignments which are meant to direct an individual's attention towards a particular school of thought are often a detriment to independent development among students. For example, a student inspired by the life and works of

Jane Austen may find themselves stifled when forced to write a paper on how

Joseph Heller utilizes characterization in his novel,

Catch-22 . Giving students permission to pursue topics that interest them, rather than content for which they have no passion, inspires curiosity, passion for learning, as well as an independence that could not be found in teacher-designed projects.

Some argue that not all students are capable of developing their own summer projects, whether it be for lack of work ethic, motivation, or a general desire to learn. These individuals believe that some students require the guidance inherent in teacher-designed projects in order to perform well academically. Although it is true that allowing these projects to be student-designed may be difficult for some students, encouraging these individuals to think and work in an independent manner would be more beneficial than allowing them to do otherwise. Not only would giving students free rein to design their own project provide them with skills that would help them in the future, it would also break many bad study habits and inspire within them diligence in academics.

Critical thinking and independence are incredibly important to growing students. Developing these skills at a young age provides them with a unique viewpoint regarding academics and learning that will benefit them greatly as they graduate and begin to enter the workforce. Independence, especially in thought, provides individuals with freedoms and opportunities that they might not otherwise have. Similarly, critical thinking skills enable students to prosper in environments where others may instead be stifled. It is imperative that the significance of these concepts is not downplayed, as they show that students would benefit greatly from student-designed summer projects more so than teacher-designed ones. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
1D7E734B4A3D,"Some Schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break.

Some may point out that since the students are the ones taking time out of their break to complete these assignments, they should be the ones designing them.

Others may argue that the teachers should design these projects.

Summer projects should be teacher-designed because the teachers will be the ones grading them, they will make sure that there is still an element of difficulty, and they know the content best.

One reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is that the teachers will be the ones grading these projects.

Teachers spend hours or even days grading assignments.

If students designed the projects, it would be harder for teachers to determine what the grading rubric should include.

It should be up to them what they will be inevitably grading at the start of the school year.

Most teachers have new students every year.

If students designed these projects, they would be different every year.

This would lead to mistakes because the teacher would not be as familiar with the assignment.

Another reason why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is that they will make sure the project will still have an element of difficulty to it.

It is teachers' jobs as educators to continue create and assign projects that are challenging enough for the level that their students are at.

If students designed their projects, the projects would not be very difficult.

This would be because students generally prefer to spend their summers doing other things than homework.

If the assignments are not challenging, than the students are more likely to forget about it or not care about it.

The point of summer assignments is to keep the students engaged and learning throughout the break.

Teachers would make sure that the assignment is easy enough so students dont spend their entire summer stressing about it, but challenging enough so that the assignment is still effective.

The last reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is that they know the content best.

The projects assigned are most likely for the class the students plan on taking the following school year.

For example, if a student is taking algebra 2 and plans to continue on to pre-calculus, the student doesnt know much about calculus yet.

That being said, how would a student design a project for a class they havent taken yet.

The students are there to learn and it is the teachers job to teach them.

The students should not, and could not, teach themselves the content required to know for the following year.

The only person who can properly prepare students for a class is the teacher themselves.

In conclusion, the summer projects that some schools require students to complete should be teacher-designed.

First, Teachers should be able to create what they will be grading.

Second, Teachers will also make sure that the projects are not just pointless busy work.

And last but not least, It is the teachers job to educate student on unfamiliar subjects.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
F42CD95ADB88,"Some schools require students to complete summer assignments to assure they continue learning during the break. Some people say that these summer assignments should be designed by teachers. Others believe that these assignments should be created by students. It is rightfully argued that students should not have the ability to design such important assignments. As such, summer assignments should be teacher designed because it would be based off material taught in the class, it would allow students an opportunity to to get an understanding of what the class is like, and would prevent students from producing bellow standard assignments.

By allowing teachers the ability to tailor summer assignments, it would allow the assignments to be based off what the teacher sees as beneficial to teach. An assignments created by the teacher, allows for them to introduce material that otherwise would not be covered if students where to make the assignment themselves. This opportunity would be beneficial in helping students better understand the material that will be covered in class. It would also be beneficial because it would teach students material before school starts. Allowing for students to be knowledgeable about the subject before they even walk thought the doors of the school the next year. Just these opportunities alone would help students academically.

Another reason why the assignment should be teacher designed is because it helps students better understand their teachers work style. The assignments would reflect how the teacher would present the topics that would be covered in class. This will help students know how to adjust their work habits to be best suited for the class. The assignment would also show what the workload would be like for the class. This invaluable information would help students find their footing in the classroom setting. Overall, this will help guide students find a way to do their best in the class.

Yet another example to the importance of a teacher created assignment would be the prevention of low quality work. The standard set by a teacher created assignment would allow all students to be on the same page academically. This would insure that, even thought one might put in the minimal required effort, one will be on par with their peers on what they need to know. The standardized assignment would also act as a form of quality control. This would prevent some students from producing lackluster project with no effort, as well as preventing students from going overboard on their assignment. These sorts of oversights show the importance of a standardized, teacher created assignment.

These reasons alone show just how important a teacher made summer assignment truly is, It allows for material to be taught even before the beginning of the school year. It creates an opportunity for students to adapt to their teachers work style. Plus, this would create a standard one must strive to achieve. While some say this method of creating assignments stifles creativity, it allows for a better quality of work to be created. In the end, a carefully planned, designed, and crafted teacher made assignment is more beneficial then one slapped together by a student.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
490867E5D019,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Schools argue whether projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. They both have benefits and different impacts on students. However, summer projects should be teacher-designed, because teachers can integrate what they will teach and they also have professional experience.

One main reason summer projects should be teacher-designed is that teachers can integrate what they will be teaching. A small, but very important thing teachers have in common is that they have a lesson plan. A lesson plan is what teachers utilize to understand what curriculum they will teach and how they will teach it. As a result, the teacher can use the curriculum as their foundation of the project. For example, the International Baccalaureate, IB, program requires students to complete a Summer Reading Project. As an IB student, I had to complete it this past summer. We had a list of books to choose from, and we had to write an essay about the message of the book and make a poster about what we learned from the book. What I didn't realize, was that the book had a connection to what we were going to learn in class. The project helped the students make a connection to the class and learn faster and more efficiently. This results would not be possible, if a student designed the project so this is why summer project should be designed by a teacher.

Another reason summer projects should be teacher-designed is, because they have more professional experience than students. Teachers most go to college to become teachers and be hired by a school. This means: they have a degree on education, are certified to be teachers, and they understand the subject better than students. In addition, they have experience from previous years and students. So they understand that students learn differently. Consequently, they can come up with a method to make the project educative and impactful for every student; regardless, of how different they learn. For these reasons, the summer projects should be teacher designed.

Some may argue that summer projects should be student-designed, because students understand each other. While this statement is true it is bias. It's bias, because students are often with their friend group which often understand each other. On the other hand, friend groups are all different, meaning they have different beliefs and values. Another reason, the statement is bias is that students have different learning styles. A student can be a fast learner and don't need to study as hard as others students; however, another student might need more reinforcement to learn. So if a student was to design a project it would be based on their personal preference and not about everyone. Concluding, that summer projects should not be designed by students because they can be bias.

As a conclusion, summer projects have to be teacher-designed. It must be designed by teachers, so students can learn efficiently and effectively. Also, it can help the teacher understand and get to know the student through their summer project. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
0A0B289272ED,"Have you ever come back to school after a long summer break and forgot everything you previously learned? Than you probably had an easy summer project if you had one at all. Many teachers let their students off easy for summer thinking they need a break, but what they are really doing is setting them up for failure for the following year. Although some may believe otherwise student preparedness, teacher support, and students using previously learned information prove that teacher should design summer projects.

If a teacher designs a summer assignment it will most likely introduce students to things they will learn the next year. This will provide students with an opportunity to be ahead at the start of the following year and make it easier for teachers too. Teachers would not have to spend as much time teaching the students things they already learned, they can just review it and go onto harder material. This will also give students a base for the start of the following year and they will already know what to expect. Some people believe that students should have a break during the summer although I agree, you are going to have to do an assignment even if it is made by students or the teacher, so why not get a head start on the next year. This will also allow students to pull from knowledge they already have.

A good summer assignment will allow students to use what they learned the previous year. If a student is able to use what they already learned their is a much higher chance that they wont forget it. One of the worst feelings in school is when the teacher is reviewing things you need to know from the previous year and you forgot most if not all of it. Why would you want to take a class for a year and not retain the information you need to know. Doing an assignment in the summer, even if it does not pertain to the information you learned will keep your brain active and give you a better chance of remembering what you learned. Some people would say that if a student really learned the information in school than they do not need a summer assignment, But many students do not learn everything to the extent that they need to to be able to remember it the next year. One of the main reasons students dont complete summer projects is because they cant. If the students create the assignment than the teacher can not help.

If a teacher creates a summer assignment than they can give the students videos or websites that can help them. This can support the student since there will be no teacher present to help them. If students create the project than the teacher will not be able to help them at all. If students create the project some students may believe the project that they created is easy, but it is difficult for some students to learn without the support of a teacher or video. Teachers creating the assignment will make it so they can complete their project in a timely manner and still enjoy summer. Some people would say that students should have easy summer assignments that dont require assistance but this is proven wrong every year by students who do not remember previous information.

Many students do not do the summer assignment assigned to them or cram it all to the last minute because it is normally just busy work. If summer projects were assigned by teachers than they would most likely be work to help you with the upcoming year and help you remember. If this was the case than most productive students would realize the value of them and work on them in a timely manner. If students did their part by completing the assignment and teachers gave out assignments that help summer projects will no longer be looked at as busy work but as a tool to recall information and give you a head start. If students created the assignment than it would continue being looked at as busy work and a waste of time.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
72279B65EB03,"Summer break is a time every student and teacher look forward to and count the days until it arrives. However, one of the things that many students dread is summer projects. Summer projects could be assigned by all or just a few classes. They can be from reading a book to writing 3 essays about the subject. These assignments are often only designed by teachers but it is time for a change. Summer projects created by students would be better for their academical, social, and mental prosperity.

To start with, if students were to create these assignments, academic learning would be more accurate and necessary. Often times teachers can create projects that aren't accurate to what students really need to practice and focus on. A student best knows what their struggles and weaknesses are thus making assignments that help those weaknesses more accurate. The projects would be a accurate representation of what they need to work on. For example, if most of the students were struggling on one aspect of geometry, they would create a project that focuses on that. Plus, if the students really wanted to improve, the project would be more likely to get done. A lot of the times students do not do these summer assignments because they feel like it is unnecessarily difficult. A good amount of these projects are just long busy work that the students are very unlikely to complete. If students were to make them though, there would be no complaints about it being unnecessary. Overall, student-designed projects avoid inaccurate and unnecessary factors. Also, not only do they help academically, but socially as well.

Additionally, self-made projects would make room for social time and priorities. It is important to have free time with friends and family so students maintain a social life. Social lives are important because humans are social creatures and tend to not do well without interactions. This social life is often difficult to keep up with when a student is locked up in their room doing these consuming projects and assignments that do not even help them. Family time is also being limited by these assignments. Sometimes the only time a student can see their family is during the summer. Take for instance divorced parents who only get to see their child every once and a while and one of those times being summer. Also, priorities such as jobs can be jeopardized. Students a lot of the times have full time jobs over the summer that require a lot of their time. Thus, they will not always have time to do their work. However, if these students were to make their own projects they can account for their schedule. Consequentially, having this social freedom helps with students mentally.

Some teachers might say that their assignments are made to help students and there is no excuse to not completing them. However, a lot of them do not factor in the fact that it is not only their assignment the student has to worry about but multiple. This could cause mental strain that overwhelms and overworks a student. The overload of work causes serious stress for a student. This stress is an actual issue that can even cause physical problems such as getting sick. Thus stress can hinder their ability to work effectively. Everyone has a limit to what they can do including these students.

All together, student-designed projects could benefit them in several ways. To start, they are accurate and necessary representations of what the student needs. Also, they can be designed to free up time for family, friends, and jobs that help maintain a social life. Thus, avoiding the mental strain and stress that comes with the overload of teacher-designed assignments. Summer break provides a well deserved rest to students and faculty and should not be any harder than it needs to be.             ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
B4F68B3BBAA4,"If there's one time of the year that students consider to be hallowed or holy, it's summer vacation. Any tampering that a school might do with this break is considered blasphemy against their sacred holiday. If a school system decided to introduce a program of graded projects for students to complete during summer vacation, it would be in their best interest to give students say in what they work on. School projects assigned over summer break should be student-designed because it would help foster a desire for learning, it would be easier to incorporate, and it would improve the experience of the teachers grading them.

When students spend hours and hours studying topics they have no interest in over the course of 12 years, it often creates a disillusionment with learning and the pursuit of knowledge. Summer is a time of escape from this tedium for students, and asking them to complete further teacher-designed projects over the summer would exacerbate the problem. If the school allowed students to choose a premise or topic of study for their projects, it would increase student engagement with and interest in completing the assignment. Granted, it would still be school work, and most students would still be frustrated with its presence in their vacation, but offering choice would allow more students to actively want to work on their project, learn more, and pursue their topic. School crushes intellectual curiosity. I've observed this in my life in the contrast between my and my peers' enjoyment of novels. I love to read, and do it often. Most of the people I know never read a book unless it's for school. This is because, from a young age, I had the choice to read, and reading was its own reward. For other students, they were forced to read, either in school or by their parents. In this system, reading was a means to reach a reward, whether it was a good grade on an assignment or a treat from their parents. Reading for fun offers them no reward. By forcing students to do projects they didn't choose over the summer, it further perpetuates the belief that learning is only good for getting the grade they want. Letting students choose their project would partly restore the connection between learning and enjoyment.

If officials attempt to institute these projects in a school system that has previously had no summer assignments, the push back from students and their parents would be immense. The school board would receive hundreds of cliched complaints of summer being ""students' time to relax"" and so on. Letting students design their projects would ease the tension. There would still be a grandly negative response, but once students learned that they would be allowed to choose a topic of study, it would assuage at least many of them. To illustrate, any class I've been that's had to read a novel for school has hated doing so (I outline why in the previous paragraph). Assignments where students got to pick their own novel or choose between a group of novels, though, were received with less vitriol. While students still didn't like the idea of having to read for class, having the choice of what to read meant they were more willing to do it. Students don't want to be told how they'll be spending their summers. If they choose their projects, they'll have less of a sense of being mandated and it will be easier to institute this assignment.

Now, some might say that giving students choice in their projects would lead to many not pursuing anything of value. If the purpose of the summer project is to ""continue learning"" when kids aren't at school, isn't it a risk to give students the freedom to research something unrelated to their academic studies? This is problem has a simple, obvious solution: these will be student-designed, teacher-approved projects. To experience the benefits explained in the previous paragraphs, schools need not provide students with complete freedom, only a feeling of choice. Teachers will be able to keep students on track by guiding them toward project topics that will assist them in the next school year, and students still get to pursue a topic they're interested in.

Finally, student-designed projects would offer teachers a less monotonous grading process. Throughout my school career, whenever we've been assigned projects where we're allowed to choose our topics of study, my teachers always comment that they're much more interesting and enjoyable to grade than other projects. Coming back to school after the freedom of summer is difficult for teachers too, and getting to grade projects students were passionate about creating is a way to ease into the year. For the next 36 weeks, teachers will be grading tedious collections of the same assignment. At the beginning of the year, they should have a collection of assignments that they can find some interest in reviewing.

Students treat summer with a protectiveness nearing religious fanaticism. Schools encroaching on this time could be met with disastrous results. Introducing a system of summer assignments could cause an uproar with the student body, but this would be lessened if students had the option to choose the topic of their projects. It's all about the choice. Having this choice stimulates students' intellectual curiosity, lessens the negative reaction to the assignment's institution, and makes everything far more pleasant for the teachers in the center of the affair.                        ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
AB3606E85520,"An important part of a child's learning is the time between school years. This time is usually spent down by the beach, or in the mountains. But, for some schools this time is used for projects; projects usually are a serious, mid-late-year rush to get a high weighted grade in before the year is over. Schools that require Summer projects need to switch to student designed projects. Students will have more interest in their projects if they deigned them. This Interest would make learning new things much more fun and exciting for students. If teachers deigned the projects, it would be a generic project with stiff guidelines.

When students have the choice to choose, then more will do well compared to a teacher generated project. Students know what they like, letting them pick would let them dive deeper into a subject they like. Students don't like being confined with very few choices of what to do, this eliminates that factor by giving them a sense of freedom of choice. The purpose of the project is to let the students learn during summer, learning is easier when there is interest in a subject. If the students chooses then they are more likely to enjoy the project.

Without constricting guidelines students could express themselves in new ways through their project. For example, a song, dance, modal of what they researched, or maybe an interview with an expert in that field. Having fun is an important part of this project. The fun in the project spurs the student to learn more for the project and with luck, continue to research and look up facts own their own, without the need of a project to guide them forwards.

Teachers are incapable of filling the need of unique projects for each student. When assigning projects, they assign a single topic that can be worked on, and with strict guidelines on how the project must be completed. This formula usually ends with frustration on both parties as the students are unhappy at the constraints placed upon them, and the teacher is unhappy as they become apparent to the fact that they can't conform to every students needs without spending all of their time or making other students upset.

A student is always willing to do more work if the student enjoys the work. Having the students deign the project that fits their needs individually, rather than a one-project-fits-all, teachers will not have any more work than before, students will enjoy their projects more, and project scores will rise.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
F62C0023C996,"There are many schools who assign projects over the summer. Assignments can range from a large packet of math to an even larger packet on earth science. These packets are generally designed by teachers, but what if students designed them instead? If students designed these projects, then they would be more interesting than a packet with a hundred problems to be answered. If students design assignments for their peers then they'll be far less boring and more likely to get done.

In the classroom, students will listen to their teachers ramble on, and not truly hear a word they say. What these instructors are saying isn't really catching the student's attention, it's boring them. But if their interests were taken into consideration when making projects then they would become more involved. The same goes for summer projects. If the teenager's assignments are based on things they don't care about, they won't do them, but someone of the same age comes in, then they can pinpoint the teenager's interests easier.

Now that the assignment has caught the attention of the student, the student is far more likely to get it done. The urge to procrastinate will not be there as much because it is an interesting way to learn more. They don't feel pressured into doing the assignment and are not as stressed by the idea of having to tackle another assignment.

Some would say that it is not a good idea to allow students to create these assignments because they'll make them to easy or won't really try when they make it. But students are just as capable as the teachers when it comes to helping out their peers and getting these summer projects done. In short, if the students design the summer projects it would turn out better. So, if students do end up designing these projects, then they will take into consideration the students interests and make the projects better for the student then they'll get done much easier.        ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
FC2845A0ECD0,"Some schools require students to to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. There is an ongoing debate over whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. Though there are those who argue these summer projects should be teacher-designed, this is not true. Although some may disagree, these projects should be student-designed.

There are various reasons these summer projects should be student-designed. One, these projects would not be so daunting a task to undertake, so students would be less overwhelmed. Many students become overwhelmed by the daunting task of fulfilling the requirements of their assigned summer projects, so they put it off till the last minute. Instead of turning in a what could have been a well executed project, if left to their own devices, the results are shoddy and incomplete. Additionally, students are more likely to to put in the time and effort into working on a project of their own design. Students creating their own projects, will motivate them to put their best foot forward. By students designing their project, it becomes a reflection of themselves and their abilities; therefore, they will aspire to present their best work.

There are additional reasons summer projects should be student designed. Students-designed projects are a more accurate assessment of a student's capabilities and knowledge. They test if students can apply what they have been taught without guidance from a teacher or rue brick. This provides teachers with a more accurate gauge to individually assess students. Moreover, these projects would allow students to express their own individuality. Teacher-designed projects confine all students to work within the same parameters, resulting in cookie-cutter projects. Student-designed projects give the freedom to express differing personal interests and modes of creativity.

Although some may disagree, summer projects should be designed by students. Student-designed summer projects are less daunting task to complete, provide students with an outlet to express their individuality, and demonstrate to the teachers what each student is capable of through the application of their preexisting knowledge. Though there are those who argue summer projects should be teacher-designed, this is not true. It would be beneficial to both students and teachers to have student-designed summer projects. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
D2FE8D69BCB0,"Some schools require students to complete projects over summer vacation. The reason that many schools do this is to ensure that the student is somewhat engaged academically so they can return to school with a drive to learn. However, many students cannot bear the task of a project during the summer, as many want to be as far from teachers or school authority as possible over the 2-and-a-half month break. This pattern of avoiding summer projects could be fixed as quickly as a blink of the eye. These summer projects should be student-designed. These student-designed projects would be much more beneficial because students would be self-motivated to complete the project, and the student would have much more fun completing the project due to the fact that it is designed by the student.

When being told by someone else to do something, more times than not can decrease a person's will to actually complete the task asked of them. This is why many students sometimes fall behind on classwork or struggle in school in general, because they lose the motivation to complete the task due to someone else giving them a designated time to complete work. When people set their own goals, they tend to work harder and want to get the best score possible. This is called self-motivation, and you need to be self-motivated in life to complete tasks. However, people are normally more self-motivated when they set goals for themselves. If students were able to design their own summer-projects, they would actually be self-motivated to complete the task at hand. Also, it would give the student a higher sense of achievement knowing that they picked their own project and worked hard to complete it.

Everyone knows that self-motivation is the key aspect to complete tasks, however it is very hard to be self-motivated to complete a task you are not interested in. This is the biggest reason of why children and teenagers struggle in school. Many teenagers are just not interested in the topics that they learn about in school, thus decreasing their drive to work hard in school. Summer projects are no different, and are almost identical to the other examples given, except it is given in the summer. If a student wouldn't be interested in conquering the project in school, there is absolutely zero chance that the student would put their full effort into the project. That would be disastrous, the student would receive a bad grade and would hurt his/her chances of getting a good grade for the quarter, and would not properly prepare the student for the upcoming school year. If the student was passionate about the project, he/she would spend time completing the project, and would put 100% effort into what they were doing.

An assignment given by a teacher compared to a student-designed project has many different outcomes. A teacher-designed project would most likely not be beneficial due to the lack of effort given. A student-designed project would show the student's potential and would actually most likely be enjoyed by the student. These student-designed projects would be much more beneficial because students would be self-motivated to complete the project, and the student would have much more fun completing the project due to the fact that the topic is chosen by the student.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
29F34BD4DD98,"Everyone likes to do things in their own way. You like to have control of certain things and you want to do it in a certain way. In Subway, for example, you like to build your own sandwich and put all the toppings you like. You get to choose if you want turkey or ham, olives or tomatoes, or maybe you just want a slice of thin bread and cheese. Just like how you like to build your own sandwiches and food, summer projects should be student-designed. If students were to design their own projects, they would learn more efficiently and have an opportunity to showcase their creativity.

We as a society value creativity and uniqueness. They are qualities that are taught and promoted in our schools and communities. Therefore, summer projects should be student-oriented because they can showcase their creativeness and their own ideas. Students will have the opportunity to show how they think and their originality. As a student, I like when Ms. Generic_Name gives the class a project to do. All Ms. Generic_Name does is give us a topic and tells us to write an essay, do a PowerPoint, or a poster. We get many options, there are no barriers as to what we can do. She says she wants to see our thinking process and wants us to be interested in what we do. If we get to design our projects we will be much more interested in completing it, whereas if it was teacher-designed we would be indifferent towards it. We are not robots or computers that simply do things all the same. We are humans with different ideas and thoughts. That's why you may tackle a problem differently than I would. Thats why summer projects should be student-designed, so we can show our teachers our different ideas and thoughts.

I hate it when a teacher tells us to do our notes in a certain way. If we take notes, its so they can help us study and review. Each person has their own way of learning, so our notes are not always going to be the same. As Ms. Generic_Name says, "" Your notes, your way."" Meaning that taking notes will not benefit her but it will benefit us. So we should take notes our own way. With projects it is the exact same thing. If we get teacher-designed projects, we may not really learn the material and the whole thing will have been for nothing. A teacher is not going to think how a student thinks. The whole purpose of giving students summer assignments is so we can continue learning during our break. But how can we learn efficiently if we are not given the opportunity to do things our way. If we do get to design our projects we will be interested in the topic we are given and do our research with enthusiasm. We tend to do better in things we are interested in and things we are good at.

Many can argue that it is better if the projects assigned should be teacher-designed because it shows students capacity to follow tasks. They also say that it prepares them for future jobs where they may need to do an assignment the way their supervisor tells them to do. But thought our entire school lives we've been doing projects and assignments that are designed by teachers. Therefore, in the summer, students should be able to show their skills and creativity. Being original is an attribute that companies also look for in employees, not just the ability to follow tasks. By allowing students to design their own projects, teachers are better preparing them for the future and their careers.

In conclusion, summer assignments should be student-designed. If we get to design our projects we will be able to show our creativity and our way of thinking to teachers. We will also show more interest in our project and puts lots of effort. And of course we will learn more efficiently if we get to design our projects. It is more beneficial if students were to design their projects instead of the projects being designed by a teacher. Just like how you like to do things a certain way, we students should be able to design the summer assignments. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
1596E1BA9983,"Summer break is a time to let loose from school. That means going to the beach, sleeping until noon, and not doing any activities that has to do with learning. Having these schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they continue learning during their break is a great way to keep their brains working at all times. However, I believe that these summer projects should be teacher-designed and not student-designed due to that it will be a reliable project and students will know that expectations are high.

Having these summer projects be teacher-designed, means that it will be a reliable project. For example, let's say it was a student-designed assignment. The student lay out their own assignment of what they learn during the summer in any format they want to put it as. Well, how does the teacher know if the source is reliable or not? Teachers dont know if any of the information is confirmed to be true. That is why having teachers lay out projects or assignments is necessary. Not just for the student, but as well as for the teacher.

Another reason for having these summer projects be teacher-designed, means that expectations from teachers will be high. Knowing that the format of the project was designed by teachers, they will expect students to follow the procedure and meet the expectations that are given.

Some might say that these summer projects should be student-designed since the student is the one doing the project and it's during their summer time. However, the problem with that being said, students will not know where to begin. Having no format or guidance will cause them to put any information down. Those information being unreliable sources; leading back to my first reason.

In conclusion, these summer projects should be teacher-designed due to that it will be a reliable project and students will know that expectations are high. As long as these students are given projects that have the essential format along with students putting down resourceful information over the summer to assure they continue their growth in learning, they should be in good hands.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
F576B3F624B3,"Some schools require to complete summer projects to make sure students continue to learn over the break.

The pros of when teachers design summer projects they are preping students for the start of the new year and also seeing what students strengths are also, what weakens students. The pros of when students design summer projects are that, they can choose what they want to work on and find something that interests them. That position I am taking in this prompt is, student-designed and here's why.

Yes teachers want to test us on knowledgeable subjects and stories ,but sometimes I believe it is to much on a student not everyone learns the same. Students should be given an equal oppurtunity to do summer projects.

If a student designs the project he or she may actually fin it interesting because, they can do what they want to do instead recieving a designed project from the teacher. Like examples for boys would be different types of sports, all types of cars, marketing, music industry, and many more. For girls it would be cooking, benefits on keeping your hair clean, acting, traveling, and much more. This gives students the oppurtunity to express themselves instead of a teacher thinking that, maybe this is a good topic or that one. Also doing something like this is fair for each student.

As of being a student we also have a lot of activities going on over the summer such as working, sports, traveling to different states, and countries and even more. I think that's another reason why we should design it ourselves. Teachers should also get a break as well because they work all year round so it would make sense for us to do it on our own.

Although teachers can be helpful with coming up with projects and designs. I believe that us as students should be the ones creating and designing our own projects over the summer. It gives us an equal oppurtunity to express are feelings and gives us a voice. That's what I have for you today and I hope I persuaded you enough on why students should design there own summer projects instead of teachers doing it for them.    ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
77AEF426D6C8,"Summer break is the time when students get to relax and forget about everything they learned about during the school year. Many teachers design a summer project to help this dilemma. Teachers should let students design their own summer projects. This helps students want to do the assignment and they can make it suit them intellectually.

When teachers give summer projects they have made, students tend to not do it. This is because they might think it is boring or they just do not want to do it. There are more interesting activities for kids to do during the summer. So, if they do not like it, they will decide to do those activities instead of the project. For example, when I was younger, my teacher gave us a project where we were required to read the book and answer the questions. The whole summer I would pull it out and then put it right back; then go play outside with my cousins. The reason I did not do it was, because it did not catch my attention enough for me to even get started. I had not learned anything all summer and my teacher was not happy. She was even more disappointed when she learned none of the class had even touched the book. The idea of us learning and keeping our brains educated had failed. Students need a project that is going to catch their attention and keep it there. The summer project would have been more effective if she had allowed us to do our own project.

If students make their own project, they can make it suit them more comfortably. A student may not understand the topic of the project their educator has assigned them. Then, they end up not doing it at all, simply because they cannot comprehend it. A student knows their own intellect, therefore they can make a project that is not difficult for them. Once my friend had a teacher would always assigned them hard summer projects. She would always be puzzled and never got to finish them. So, the next summer her teacher finally decided to let them make their own projects. My friend successfully made her own assignment and aced it when she got back the next school year. It becomes easier for a student when they have made a project that they can really understand.

Many people believe that teachers should assign the project, because they know the criteria. However, this is a false statement, just because a teacher knows more does not mean they can create a project that happily suits their students. This is because they will actually do their summer project if it fun and interesting. They also can make the material geared more towards their level of knowledge of a subject. To help, teachers could wait a month before the end of the year and let the students come up with their own personal project that is fun to them. They could set aside class time every day, so students can perfect their assignment and have a intriguing summer project. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
86C3CBD25A60,"Should these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Teachers should design the project because it will help students be stress free, give students a general idea of the project, and time management ability. Summer is to enjoy and to relax, and a teacher-designed project will allow students to do so.

What student would want to stress over the summer because they can't think of a project idea? A teacher-designed project will help students be stress free because students would get a teacher-made rubric which will support them. Students are poured with stress during school, and when summer is time to relax, students should not have to worry about a project idea.

A teacher-designed project will give students a general idea of the project allowing students to worry less because students wouldn't have to stress about their project idea. It will help students visualize what the teachers want, and also help teachers when it's turned in because of the rubric designed by the teacher. Giving students a general idea will make the project easier for the student and the teacher.

A teacher-designed project will remind students the due date of the project, and this is important because it will help students manage time for the upcoming year. Most likely, time management will be a huge factor for students for the next year, and practicing that with a teacher-designed project will improve the students ability to manage time.

So does allowing the students pick their assignments help? The idea that summer projects should be student-designed is valid because it allows students to learn while still enjoying the summer.

Furthermore, by giving students the option to choose their own summer projects they will be more encouraged to do the work. As it will be something they have interest in and would be excited to learn about. This option opens their horizons to many different ideas that can be explored; As for if the teacher told them what to do their options and/or minds would be limited. Students want to have fun over the summer and being given the option to chose their project allows that bit of freedom they wanted from school.

When given the option students would enjoy a project more if they were allowed to pick their subjects. Won't be bored and stuck with an idea that causes them to lose interest in doing the project all together. Allowing students to pick their subjects allows them to still have fun during the summer break. Even so they could incorporate their project into their summer fun giving the project creativity.

As a teacher you shouldnt give a student so much work over the summer that they dried on doing it as it should be something simple or none at all. When the school year is finally over kids don't want to have to worry about more work that needs to be done. They need a break to replenish there brains and come back to the new year strong.

As a result, student-designed projects are the best choice for students as it will encourage them to want to do it and allow them to enjoy doing it too.

D228AB564BF6,"The dreaded summer assignment, boring students by holding them hostage inside and not letting them enjoy their time to be free. All the stress of the school year washes away when students leave the building in June, but then students are reintroduced to that stress with projects and extensive work that may not be of interest. The more likely the students are uninterested in the work, the more likely they are to not turn it in, so why not make summer assignments what the students want while introducing the course they are set to take. Summer assignments should be student-designed so those students can take interest in their study and make learning fun.

Nobody in the world wants to wash summer away with book work from the class they don't like. Projects like research papers, essays, and 20+ page packets can drown students for the months they have off. Summer before sophomore year, for my history class we had 2 20+ page packets to ""introduce us to the course"", when in reality, it was just a few hours a day for weeks of busy work of finding answers in textbooks. Painful summer projects, like my class's history packets, will put a bad taste in the students' mouth before they even step foot on school grounds for the year. Summer assignments have to be short, sweet, and efficient, or they will lose the student, potentially for the entire school year.

Students designing their own summer projects will interest them more in the topic, as well as transform the summer project from a burden to something students want to complete. Students should be able to pick a topic for a standard project, like a short PowerPoint or a poster presentation, where students can go hands on while learning. Those history packets would be much more involving to me if they had to do with the World Wars or Military history, and even more if they involved some sort of project component. Disinterest also causes students to be less likely to complete summer assignments. I know of plenty of students, that just won't turn in the project or assignment if they don't want to do it. Summer of Junior year, my class had an essay to write about a current political issue. Half of the class turned in that assignment on time because they just didn't want to do it or were plainly uninterested. Summer Assignments need to be like those A+ introductions to essays, they need to grab the reader and hook them into the topic early, or in the case of summer assignments, they need to interest the student so they keep going and are hooked for the year.

The only downside to student designed projects is the way of grading and assessing their work. The more freedom students are given within a project, the further projects are going to be from what a rubric wants, which can be a pain for teachers. If you tell students to come up with an experiment and make a presentation on a tri-fold board, you could have one kid coming in with a project about wildlife and one with a project about aerodynamics for a chemistry class, two experiments no where near being on topic. There is a limit to the freedom teachers should give students, but there should be extensive freedom to the students within guidelines.

The only way for a project students like to be made, you have to consult the students. Politicians in democratic governments don't guess what the voters want, they ask what the voters want. If teachers are trying to build something for the students, ask the students, it's simple. If teachers want more interest in a course, better grades, more students willing to work, more participants in class, or better summer projects, the only way to do so is to let the students design the assignment. Students designing the project will make learning fun.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
E730AA199FB6,"Imagine that your summer has begun and school is finally out. As months pass, you aren't concerned with work. Although, that is, until you remember your summer project for school! If only the project was student based, where there is more freedom in thinking and idea making. That said, Summer projects designed by students would be most beneficial because students can show what they know, develop independent and creative ideas, and can apply their strengths and weaknesses according to how they learn the best.

Teachers and parents alike may agree that it is more beneficial to have teacher designed projects, since they have more structured experience as well as having mastered the material. While this is a valid argument, with teacher designed projects, not all student's learning needs can be catered to. This is because every child has different strengths and weaknesses with different thought processes, especially having been away from school material for that period of time. Also, although teachers may have better structure and organization with their ideas having more experience, students need to develop those independent thinking and idea making skills for their higher education and overall knowledge. This said, teacher's should not be the ones to design summer projects.

To begin, students can show what material they already know and or have mastered by designing their own summer projects. Although projects can be designed to challenge students, having students show what they know and have mastered can help the teacher understand where they stand on certain issues and in different subjects.

Take a professional athlete for example, such as Olympic gymnast, Gabby Douglass. In her years of practice, Gabby has been asked to make up her own floor routines to show off what skills she has already mastered. When competing, this gives Gabby a chance to both show her instructors and judges what she knows, and therefore, what new skills she can work on later, after she has mastered those demonstrated skills. This can therefore be applied to a summer project in the way that after practicing a skill for however long, a student can show off their mastery for that skill, as well as setting aside the skills they will need to work on in the future when designing their own projects.

Secondly, with student designed projects, students can be independent and creative in their thinking and ideas.

This independence is valued by students, as it gives them a chance to think for themselves and come up with new and valid ideas that they may not have been given otherwise. For example, when women were granted the right to vote almost one hundred years ago, their thinking and ideas did not fit with the structure already in place in society for hundreds of years. For those hundreds of years, women were not given the chances and opportunities to be independent until they worked to prove their ideas to be valid. Although this does not directly relate to school, it provides a great example as to an individual student being able to use their independent thinking to create great ideas that can benefit them now and in the far future.

Finally, students know their strengths and weaknesses and can apply these when designing summer projects, depending on how they learn the best. Once summer has begun, students are away from their normal learning environments, which may make it challenging to succeed in some areas of their learning. This is also because every child has a different or varying learning style. For example, I am a very visual and hands on learner. I prefer writing on paper and being artistic in the way I present my work, and learn best that way. If the project designed by a teacher is using computers to do math online, I'd be at a disadvantage compared to another student who may excel in math and using technology together. This makes it harder for each student to be learning and succeeding at the same rate. Therefore, projects designed by students can be self paced, catering to each individual's learning strengths, weaknesses and differences.

During summer, students should be able to be independent in their own ideas and thinking regarding school material. Schools and administration should grant students that independence in their individual learning and let them take the initiative of showing what they know, how they can form ideas and prove their overall independence in designing their own summer projects as they grow in their school careers.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
4E73009CC4AF,"Have you ever been given a pointless assignment? When you come to class does it even benefit you? Summer projects are something that many teachers hand out. Most of the projects help, but the ones that are students-designed do not help. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because, teachers already understand the subject, if the project is too easy the student will not remember the lessons, and it will allow teachers to gauge how much the students know about the subject.

All teachers have to pass a certain threshold to become a teacher. They can not know anything about a subject and get the job. When teachers give out a summer assignment, they give it knowing that it will benefit the students. When I took Computer Science, we were told to create a game using the stuff that we have learned throughout the year. I asked my teacher if I could code a Minecraft block, because Minecraft is coded in Java Script. My teacher gave me permission, but had no experience coding in Minecraft. I came to realize that it was not really coding it was more like inserting commands that we had no knowledge of into Eclipse. To code the block all I had to do was copy and paste commands and change them to what I wanted them to be. When it came time to present my project after summer I had no clue what I actually used from the class. My teacher ended up telling my to code something else up in the parameters that she had given me. From that I also learned more of the material.

The reason students are given homework is to practice the material and to familiarize the material. If the material is too easy, then the students can not learn the material at all. For instance, before I took Algebra 2, I took it on Khan Academy. I really did not want to learn it at all so, I did all of the easy questions. Once I got into the Algebra 2 class I did not remember a single thing that I learned over the summer. If I was given a packet then, I would have done it all, but this was an online course where one could pick and choose what they wanted to do. I would have known what I was doing in class beforehand if I was given a packet. Sometimes these projects are just given so that teachers can know what the student knows.

Teachers always give students diagnostics in class. This allows them to know how much the student know, and also how much time they need to spend on certain topics. Both in my Geometry and Pre-Calculus classes my teachers handed out diagnostics. I would always get A's and B's on the topics that we had just spent a little bit of time on. My teachers would save time for themselves and us by breezing through a topic that we already knew. We ended up finishing the course a week or two before school ended. That allowed us to learn parts of the next math course giving us a head start on the other students. Come time next year I knew exactly what we were doing in class before the other students. This saves the county time and money and the students. Many students do not like the idea of a teacher-designed project, but they do not realize how beneficial it is.

When the teacher knows the subject they can create a project that is not too easy. Then when the student completes the summer project, they understand the subject to a higher degree and it is fresh in their brain. Students can then come to class having learned what they needed to over the summer. Student-designed summer projects would allow students to have more time during the summer to have fun. However, having harder teacher-designed projects will allow students to learn how to balance work and fun come time when they have a real job. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
C0BB113BE4C6,"Most may argue that one of the most important influences in a student's life is the role of a teacher. Teachers educate students on a daily basis how to be a porsperous individual and a good human being in life. Students often tend to utilize teachers as a support system in times of distress as a result of unhappiness and conflict in ones home. These educators are assigned with the imparative task of educating the next generation and future posterity on how to be the best of themselves to their ability. Teachers and students spend nine months out of the twleve months every year educating them on core and creative subjects such as art, science, music, and etc. The other three months belong to students being on break with no supervison or productivity in education. So during these three long months students are issued a summer project to keep them productive. Although some may argue that a teacher issued summer assingment limits the students ability to expand ones creativity, a teacher issued summer project is a more effective way to keep students productive as a result of students being irresponsible, oppertunity to seek help amongst classmates, and teachers having the best interest of a students education.

During summer break students have the tendency to be and make irresponsible decisions as a result of not having adult supervision. Students take summer break as a time for vacation, video games, spending time with peers, and other lesiure time. If students were given the oppertunity to design their summer project and spend time working on it rather than playing video games or going shopping at the mall; most students would take advantage of the situtation and not complete the assignment at all or put little to no effort into it. Since the majority of students want to be enjoying their summer vacation doing their favorite leisure activites before school starts in septemberthe majority of students will decide not to complete their assignment. For example, Generic_Name who is a high school student at Generic_School would rather play video games all day than stress himself on completing a project that he has to design himself without knoweledge of the teacher's grading rubric or set of directions to follow. Students cannot not be trusted with the task of completing a student designed project during summer break with all of the tempting distractions that surround them. Even though students could take advantage of the oppertunity by taking initiative on task assigned to them, allowing a teacher to issue the project would strike urgency and clarification for a student to complete this task. As a result of having a teacher issued project students can seek help amongst peers.

Peers and classmates can assits other students on the project if help is needed. Due to students having teacher designed projects, students may ask for assitance from fellow classmates for justification or clarity on ones liablities. For example, Generic_Name a high school student at Generic_School is having trouble with understanding the grading rubric; one of Generic_Name classmates named Generic_Name helps her by explaining the rubric thuroughly to her. Because students and other classsmates were issued the same project, they are now given the oppertunity to ask for help from classmates in order to increase their knowledge project score. Although critics may argue that individuality can be benefical to ones work ethic, working with others can broaden ones perspective seems to outweighs those critics. A project designed by teachers is suited to help a student perform at the best of his or her abillity.

Teachers have the best interest in what students need in order to suceed. As an influence in student lives, teachers and professors give students loads of work and tasks to challenge a student mentally in order to enchance ones ability to think critcally. If teachers do not challenge students, then students will become complacent with their detriorating work ethic and obtain a minimum level of critical thinking. This will result to students conforming with the unchallenging tasks and lead to failing grades. For example, Mrs. Generic_Name a teacher at Generic_School giving her students answers to the quiz before handing out the exam does not challenge students to critically think when taking Mrs. Generic_Name exam leading to the students recieveing failing grades as they progress to more complex levels of education such as IT, computer systems, and etc. These educators are assigning students these task in order to set them up for sucess in the future by challenging them now so the more complex assignments in the future becomes easier to them. Some may argue that teachers give an excessive amount of uncessary workload; however, the intention of challenging to stundents to be capable of critically thinking is seems to overpower the argument.

Most may argue that a teacher designed summer project is more benefical to keep students productive because the incapablity of students staying focus , assitance amongst peers, and in favor of students benefiting from completing task. Students cannot not be trusted completing task that interfere with them doing leisure activites as a result of many distractions. Working with others can expand ones knowledge to many perspectives and provide a social interaction with others which, enhances ones ability in teamwork. Teachers encourage challenging student because it allows students to think quickly and efficently eventually acting as a benefit to ones strengths. Teachers educate future generations to come so their role in each indivdual students lives are meaningful. As a result of a teachers great influence over a student these connections should be valued.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
B5DE5F7FFDCD,"Projects, we all had them before. Usually when given a project a teacher gives them,and projects by a teacher isn't exciting its rather boring. Especially when it's over the summer. The projects are boring because teachers doesn't have a very creative mind like students. With that being said students should design the projects even the ones they do over the summer. Students should design the projects because they have more of a creative mind than teachers, they know what other students would like, and they will have fun with the project.

Students have more of a creative mind than teachers. Their mind can help them with finding unique things for each of the students to write about in their projects. With them doing that they can show that they learned something and they found something interesting to talk about with the class and the teacher. Also the teacher can see that the students are responsible ,can do things by themselves, and can make a good project worth talking about. The students projects can also show the people who are higher up in the school systems that you can let students be in charge of things they usually wouldn't let students be in charge of.

When doing an activity such as a project, you should let a student conduct it because the know what other students would like. Since students typically know what other students would like, students would be interested in what the project is about because it came from it's peers and not the teacher. If it from their teacher than the students would find much interest in the project at all because teachers typically would give students something that they don't find interesting and it turns into something they dread doing,but they would have to do in order to get the grade they need. When students do that you can tell they didn't like the project. You can tell by how much effort they put into it and how the presented it to everyone. So it's best to let the students control because they typically know what other students like.

Whenever you let students take control,students will have fun with the project. Students will have fun wit the project because their getting to do something they want to do. With them doing that it helps them have a better project. If they enjoyed what they were doing because it shows in their work. You can see the extreme amount of effort they put in and how happy they were to present it to everyone. You can also see how proud they were of themselves in the process of doing this project.

Some people may think that students shouldn't be in control of a project. Some people may think that because they say that students are irresponsible,to playful,and disobedient. They may also think that since they're kids they won't follow through with anything. Little do they know students are hardworking and can finish anything they put their mind and their heart to as long as their dedicated. Just because they're kids doesn't mean you should underestimate them on what they are capable of doing.

People should start giving students a chance including teachers. They should start giving students a chance because they never know what students are capable of. Students are capable of a lot of things when they are dedicated to do it. With the reasons that i have explained above projects should be student- designed because they have more o a creative mind than teachers,they know what other student would like, and they will have fun with the project.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
32FE31495988,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. projects makes sure the kids learn also by having fun in the summer. The students pick how they want to do the projects while the teacher makes them. The more time you have on a project the more likely you will get a great grade. The opposition wrongly believes that students should not have summer projects it should be known, that students should have summer projects. Although some believe that students should not have projects during summer break to assure continue learning during spring break it should be known, school should have projects to assure continue learning during the summer.

These are how having projects over the summer are beneficial now to students who do summer projects that teachers made for them. The more students take the time to learn things over the summer with less distractions the more smarter the students will get. The more students start focusing on school and not on other students. The more work that the students have, the less trouble the students get in. If the students have projects over the summer they can get a good grade and had 3 months to work on it to make it perfect. When students have more time to work on something the more things come to mind to pick from.

These are having school projects in summer are benefits later to students who do summer projects that teachers made for them. Students that work hard in school now have a higher graduation access and do summer projects by the teacher. If you do projects in summer you already get a grade for completing it and its better for your class grade it you are ahead. The more harder the project is the more time you need on it that why its good for the summer projects especially if you are in a higher grade.

Although some believe that students should not have summer projects it should be know, students should have summer projects. Even though; the opposition believes that students should not have projects in the summer it should be known, that students should have summer projects these are the reason the opposition is wrong students can have a extra grade, more they work the less they are bored, smarter kids and easier graduation access. These are the reason that students should have summer projects.        ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
BE80D73EC131,"The education system is designed around the process of preparing children for successful living in society, whether that is pursuing higher education or entering the working world. In reality, students are unlikely to actually use most of the information taught to them during primary education, so school is a method of building skills that can be used for life rather than facts and ideas that are actually necessary. When examining a summer project, it can be assumed that learning is encouraged for the purpose of keeping these necessary skills free from decay, so these projects should be student-designed because they hone important skills regardless of the origin of their design, give students a sense of freedom and responsibility, and encourage children to learn information that they are actually interested in.

If a project is to be completed during the summer, it is unlikely that the information that the student must learn is specific to one area. If the knowledge is going to be general, then the focus of the research is unimportant, due to the fact that the basis of the project is to build skills rather than to build knowledge. It would make sense to let the students design the project if the focus is unimportant, because the skills needed for the project, like responsibility and discipline, would still be reinforced regardless. However, if the information that the student must learn is specific to one area, the student-designed process makes even more sense, because a student would better know how they learn then a teacher, which would allow them to create a design that better suites their needs for academic improvement.

If the freedom to design their own project is given to a student, it will create a sense of responsibility due to the fact that they must take ownership of a project that is not only of their own creation, but of their own design. This increase in responsibility will create better results from most students, because they must put more effort into the project to not only earn a good grade, but to also earn a sense of accomplishment from a well-done project that they solely created. The stress that this causes can also be a motivating factor that interrupts the natural process of procrastination that most students fall victim to during their summer break. Student-designed projects will create, or at least improve, a child's sense of accomplishment and self-fulfillment, an area that is widely ignored in the educational field.

Perhaps the most obvious reason to allow student-designed summer projects is the opportunity this gives students to pursue information that interests them. Children are often pressured to identify their interests from an early age, and the common overlook made by schools is that children are not often given opportunities to explore new things, and are rarely given a chance to make decisions based on what they want. They will produce better results when given freedom and are made to feel like their opinion actually makes a difference. If a student has interest in one academic field but not another, it would make no sense to stifle their passion and have them create a project that is just mediocre compared to encouraging their interest and receiving a spectacular product.

Referring to the building of skills mentioned before, a worker who is passionate about their career is going to be leagues more productive than a worker who is not. Primary school is about building academic skills rather than the accumulation of facts and is about creating a passion for learning in students. For these reasons, schools have no reason not to allow summer projects to be designed by students. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
1626F27A828F,"How many of you guys can agree that no one likes to do projects, homework, etc over the summer, I know I hate it. Although sometimes it's required so we have to do them no matter what. Theres only one thing that can make it ten times worse then that which is when your teacher picks your project. I feel like summer projects wouldn't be as bad if students got to design there own projects instead of having the teacher choose it for them. If projects were designed by students they would most likely actually complete them the students most definitely wouldn't feel stressed or overwhelmed because they would be able to work at there own pace and lastly, students would enjoy it more the would probably put in more time and effort.

Most students turn in there work but we all know that theres that handful of students that don't like to turn in there work it could be because its too hard or they dont understand. How many times have students been able to do something for them self, projects almost never so teachers wouldn't really know how students might be doing other then the homework that they provide. If students got the chance to do there own thing teachers would certainly get more feed back to see where the kids are and what theyre good at and what theyre not so good at. Many students work at a different pace then others by allowing them to choose the way they want to do they're project would make it a lot easier and more fun for them. They'll be able to take it at theyre own pace and they will have more fun doing the project.

When students hear the words projects, test , etc they often feel stressed or overwhelmed. Teachers often don't see that, they just throw the work at them and expect them to be done on time but they don't know how student often like to work. there are many ways that students work some students like to make or build stuff others just like to write or draw there are several ways people can work. Students also have a life outside of school teachers dont know what they go through at home if they have any problems going on or anything. I think in my best opinion that maybe once in a while students should get the opportunity to make there own work so teachers can reflect off of them. It's not just going to make it easier for the student as well as for the teachers theyll just have to grade the work while the students assign they're own work. teachers should always take this stuff in consideration.

It""s not super easy to be a student all of us have been there and we know what it's like. Students sometimes will turn in a paper or homework last minute and it's often turned in with half effort. some students dont try as much as others or at least they try but they have to much on there plate to balance. Other students have more advantages then others some have sports during the summer or camps or even jobs, these types of stuff are the things that could prevent them from having the necessary time to get all of there stuff done. If students didn't have so much going on in there lives now days all these projects and work would be so much more time manageable. If students had the time and resources that they need I trust that those projects wouldn't be effortless. The teachers are the only ones that can change that that way the students have more fun doing it they would also set aside more time and put in all the effort they got.

In conclusion these are the reasons why I think that students should get to design there own projects.

students would definitely get it done because they get to work at there own pace. They wouldn't feel as stressed or overwhelmed because they would be able to work in the specific way they feel is best for them. lastly they would enjoy doing they're projects because they would be able to balance everything out they would be more motivated to put more time and effort into there projects knowing that it can be done the way they'd prefer.  ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
4DE2EAF8914F,"If a student is gonna do something that's gonna take away from their free time then it should be the students that design it. Most students don't do homework or other work that teachers give them so I doubt they'll do something in the summer when it's their break. If they design it then it would make them more motivated to do that assignment. Lets face it, most teachers don't really give out the most exciting projects so a lot of students would not complete it let alone even touch it. If students are given the freedom of designing it then they could be really creative with it and get them to do it.

Students are already very unmotivated with school work so if they could design a project based on their interest then they are bound to do it. Students tend to mess around and not take their work seriously because of the fact that they are unmotivated to do it especially if it's in the summer. Giving them a choice of what they want to do will give them motivation and a sense to at least try it. It wouldn't feel as mundane as what they would usually get from teachers. Lets say for example they are given a project on the Election of 1912 and they need to do a presentation. A lot of students would give the bare minimum or rather wouldn't do it at all and forget about it. Now imagine doing that in the summer where they could be on vacation and now the possibility of them doing it is lowered. They don't find much reasons to do it besides the fact that it's for a grade.

Having the freedom to work on something comfortable with your abilities is drastically going to change how the project performs. Projects would be more appealing to look at and would creative and different. Instead of every project having the same format, students can be original and turn something mundane into an enjoyment. It wouldn't feel as forced and give them an opportunity to show off their originality. Its like if a artist wanted to make an album but they didn't have a record label. They would be limited on money and to get features and instrumentals to make music. They wouldn't have much of a freedom on what they wanted thus the album wouldn't sound as good as they wanted it to. It's the same for this as in they wouldn't get much of a choice and not performing as well as they wanted to.

Some may say that the lack of format or instructions will cause worse performances with the project. Although I can see that point in which giving them instructions will be easier to grade and to show an understanding, it will also cause a lack of involvement and need to do it. Sometimes, instructions are not gonna be crystal clear and some students would fail to understand and do things wrong. Given the same format will cause an increase in cheating and copying other students since formatting should be the same for everyone. Doing work in which should be their free time isn't really gonna be ideal when they aren't given much freedom or creativity to work with.

Summer projects should be student-designed because it'll allow freedom and motivation to do it. Motivation is key in how the project will perform and letting them have that freedom on how they want to do it goes hand and hand. Creativity is vital on how the project will perform and how well of a grade it will get. Budget in movies and videos or even music can change the output of how it sounds or performs. Given a small budget could make the performance or sound worse and disappoint people and themselves. Creativity is key in having a good project and if teachers would design it then it wouldn't be as good as if students were to design it. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
69B52531C7B0,"Vacations, relaxation, free time- these are just a few of the things students look forward to when the last day of school rolls around and summer vacation begins. But unfortunately summer is not just fun, students must maintain learning as well. From reading assignments to math packets summer work is inevitable, but if we change the guidelines to be more individualistic and open ended, students may be more motivated to utilize their knowledge in a meaningful way. Although teacher-designed projects may prepare students for the course ahead, summer projects should be student-designed because it will allows students to open their minds to creativity, projects will be more enjoyable and of higher quality, and it would be easier to manage.

Student-designed projects promote creativity, which is one of the most useful skills today. Class curriculum is bound by specific expectations and allows little room for self driven deeper thinking. So, a student-based project would allow for students to explore topics that interest them and prompt them to dive deeper. When projects are less constricted and more open to interpretation, the outcome is an individualistic product that showcases one's individuality. For example, throughout different leadership clubs or classes students must come up with their own leadership project and propose a plan to achieve a specific goal. With each student having a different goal, each project is unique and expresses one's true self, with goals ranging from benefiting the homeless to saving the environment. The projects are not teacher-designed and allow the student to explore their mind and come up with something creative yet specific to them. Skills like these are important to exercise because creativity and individuality is what will set one person apart from another in the real world, careers, and competition.

Not only will student-designed projects prompt individuality, but they will also result in a higher quality product. When a project is based on something a person is genuinely interested in, it will lead them to enjoy the work they are doing. When one enjoys the work they are doing, they do a better job at it. For instance, we have been raised to pick a career that we enjoy because those who love their job are the ones that do it best. Therefore, we should do summer projects and school work the same way. Teacher-designed projects that restrict creativity will be dreadful and considered as busy work to the student, which will result in work that is simply complete just to get checked off. But incorporating open ended possibilities will make summer learning more enjoyable compared to the endless stream of work during a regular school year, where close to everything is teacher-based. Teachers also would enjoy seeing projects of high quality that showcase an individual's drive to explore new things that are enjoyable to them rather than a repeat of the same five step project over and over again. Student-designed projects will increase the quality and pleasure of the required summer work load.

Along with summer projects, students also need to balance work, family trips, and just enjoying life as a kid. Student-designed projects will allow one to manage their time in way that incorporates the project to their convenience. The regular school year brings enough stress with constant strict deadlines and expectations, so summer should be the time to let students breathe and mold projects around the components of break itself. No kid wants to work on their biology summer project during their beach vacation, but for example, students could incorporate an ocean or sea life based aspect to a self created project, that will not take away from the time spent on break. A trip to Europe can expand on a history project, rather than textbook readings and vocabulary words. Also, many teenagers are expected to maintain a job and earn money, and they may not have enough time to do a project molded by teachers who do not know details to each student's home life schedule. Students deserve the opportunity to indulge in a project that they believe fits best for themselves and the responsibilities they must tackle during the time that is meant to be a break from it all. Self-based projects will allow for students to incorporate learning into enjoyable things, so that is it more doable for them.

The warm weather and pool days should not be the only things students have to enjoy over summer break. With a student-designed project that is molded to an individual's schedule and interests, summer work could become enjoyable too. A rigid school year routine allows for a more flexible summer, which should also allow for a more flexible workload. Summer projects should be student-designed because they will prompt individuality, be of higher quality, and be done without extra stress to the teen. Making room for creativity and self-interest will result in a project that is more beneficial to the students in general. Enough of the expectations from students are teacher- designed, and as a society we would be surprised as to what amazing outcomes can come from promoting more individuality and freedom throughout learning.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
876DA6B76DDF,"Summer has always been seen as the well deserved break from school that students deserve. However, for many advanced placement students, summer can be filled with projects and homework to prepare them for their rigorous courses. These rigorous courses can be honors, advanced placement, or dual enrollment classes offered by the school district. Summer homework has become the distinction between academic and higher education options. The question remains, is summer homework more beneficial when it is designed by a teacher or by a student. Although students have the advantage since they took the course themselves while the teachers seldom take part of the tests or classwork, teachers would be better equipped in making summer enrichment projects because teacher are far more educated, have made many projects for students in the past, and have most likely taught the course in the past. These reason showcase why teachers are better at making projects for the summer than students are.

It is a fact that teachers are more educated than students are. Teachers have completed years of college to be able to teach in a classroom. Students have not even complete high school compared to the numerous years of education teacher had to go through. Teachers also have to go through a apprenticeship and learn from a teacher after they achieved their college education. During this apprenticeship, many teachers watch and learn as older teachers show them how to make a project that can be best suited for their classroom. This amount of work makes educators more than capable of handling making a summer project for students. Students are not as educated as teacher are. Teachers went to college to learn and be able to educate. Their education makes them more than qualified to make and grade summer projects that they assign to students. While many students have no idea where to start in terms of making a project, America's educators have been learning these skill for generations. These reasons on education are why teachers are more qualified to make summer enrichment homework than high school students.

Many teachers also have years of experience making projects for students to complete. Teacher across America have been making projects for students to complete for years. Projects arent new and teachers have been making and assigning them since day one. While many students have not once made a project for multiple peers, teachers have been making assignments and projects for years. Education alone should make teachers a far more appealing group to develop and assign projects and summer work for students to complete to understand the course. This amount of practice comes from their education and their time as teachers. Many students have no experience at all with developing and making assignments, this is a teachers job. This is why that experience alone and be the factor why teachers are more qualified to making summer projects than students are.

Also many teachers, have taught the same class or at least the same type of class. Many classes, such as the advanced placement classes, have included the same teacher for most of their careers. This is the most important factor. Since teachers have been educating in the same fields and classes for the majority of their career, they know the material and curriculum of the class. This, opposed to a student who mostly likely only spent a school year in the class, makes educator qualified to be able to assign and grade summer projects. Students merely have attended the class for only a school year while it is apart of a teachers job to understand and master the curriculum of the course. Teachers know what is on the tests and what you need to know to be successful in the class. This is why teachers are far better at making summer projects than students.

While many teachers have taught the courses, the students are the ones taking them. Students are the ones who have to study and do homework for hours and sometimes the information is not relevant for the exam. Teachers have not had the same point of view as students have today. Students at the end of the year know what they need to know to be successful in making summer projects and assignments. Although these are very valid points, they do not account for how qualified teachers are. As already mentioned, teachers have gone trough years of education, teaching the same class, and experience of making projects. Between students, who no little about the course compared to teachers, and educators, who spent years to be the best teacher they can be, teachers are far better at making summer enrichment projects. Many students are ill-equipped and ill-advised on making summer projects for them and their peers to complete and have a basic idea of the course itself.

Teacher are more qualified to make summer project because of their extensive education and apprenticeship, their time making projects in the past, and time spent learning and mastering the course. These reasons, among many others, showcase way teacher are the best at making summer assignments and projects for honor students across high school in America. Although students have the point of view of seeing and participating in lessons, taking the tests and exams, and doing the classwork and assignments, it is not comparable to the advantage that many teachers have when education students. At the end of the day, teachers are the best to plan and make summer projects that can prepare students for their upcoming class. It is up to the teachers to teach and the students to learn the topic of the course. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
DD77F2D94E3A,"Projects are not always something that students dread, in the summer it may be a different story, summer usually the time for most students to finally be free but some classes require a project before the next school year. I can agree with that since it helps retain information from the previous school year. When I though of if those projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed I thought of all the possibilities. When thinking in terms of high school, I believe that summer projects should be student designed to build skills in project management, to be more independent, and to learn more about subjects on their own.

Scout organizations often have awards or ranks that require members to go through their own projects from start to finish. Eagle scouts in Scouts of America, previously known as Boy Scouts of America but still abbreviated to BSA, emphasizes the use of project management in doing their projects. Some scouts do most of their projects in the summer or during breaks because they have time. Scouts have guidelines to follow about the process and the use of the project but what the project is left to his or her interpretation. In Girl Scouts you can not duplicate projects which gives more variety in projects made. Some of these projects are not always physical like building greenhouses or building bridges but can be raising awareness. Taking these projects on requires a lot of planning either to contact governments or specific departments to build things in town or contacting the school to do a seminar at the school. They also need to plan to see how much they are spending, who they need to bring to volunteer to help them, and making advertisements to help bring awareness to their project. All of those things strengthen the skill of project management.

Most highly known award like Eagle scout for Scouts of America or the lesser known Gold Award for Girl Scouts require scouts to work from start to finish on their own. Of course, there is application to submit to their respective council to approve their project and there is guidelines to what the project may be but it's left to his or her's interpretation to make a project themselves. Some may argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed which I interpret as the teacher creates every portion of it; not just the guidelines, but what the students should do for the project like building a model, writing an essay, making a video, or making a collage. They man believe that students many not have the imagination or go so off topic that it is no longer about the subject. However, I have seen amazing things done without much input from a teacher or a leader for a project. A lot of kids can come up with awe-inspiring projects without strict guidelines and build their project at their own pace. They have to have their own initiative to research, plan, and execute their project. They have to ask permission to build on property on their own, they have to ask to do their drive their school on their own. There is no one else to help them and it helps build the skill that is needed for independence after high school.

In school some classes do end-of-year projects that are due, and presented, before the end of the school year and student pick a subject in their unit to research more on; what I did was researched on Norse mythology in my history class, my freshman year. We needed to create a poster and another visual representation of what we researched. In this case I did a doll repaint to make her look like of the Norse goddesses, I researched about the different gods and goddesses in Norse mythology. I learned about something I was interested in which gave me more of an understanding to the history tied to it. The more I learned about it the more I remembered which shows that projects that are student lead help them learn more about the subjects they learned that year and help retain the information for later years.

Student-designed projects help engineer a more independent generation. It will help them with skills they need to bring to their adult lives. They learn how to manage their time and the materials they work with. The learn the ways to be independent and take initiative to get things done. It will benefit their ability to retain information for subjects they study more into. This all shows that student designed projects in the summer will befit them more than teacher-designed projects because of how many skills it works on. For this to benefit all students, I for any summer assignment made to be student lead so it would help enforce a better school year. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
8E61C7C0F57F,"Summer break is a time of relief. A stress free vacation for kids who love to relax and not worry about exams, and final papers. A majority of schools allow kids to enjoy summer break, even though, some schools ensure that kids do a summer project to allow them to keep their mind busy throughout the long summer months. Although teachers would not know what the students plans would be, or when they commence, most people say that teachers should design the students summer projects. After all, they know what the student needs to work on, and how to help them if they fail to understand and or, have trouble understanding, and how it will affect them later on in life when they decide to go to collage or the work force.

Teachers know everything about a child academically, they know their strong points while at the same time, helping them strengthen their weak points and their overall success, only thing is, is that the child might have planned something in advance (such as long out of town vacations) and will not have all the time to get it does efficiently and in a timely manner. If kids were to make their own summer project, then they would make it to their appeal, they would make it, to be easy and not challenging their mind. Teachers, on the other hand, would make it fun, critical thinking all in one! Different teachers would also put the specific course too, such as Biology, History ,Algebra I and Algebra II, Geometry, and much more. Who knows, maybe even a language if the student was going abroad. Teachers can come up with special ways make it fun too, especially for science and history. Students can go to a history site and write a paper on how their time was, and what happened on that site. For biology, they can have them go to the zoo and write about what animals they have seen and what type of lands they live in (Grasslands, Deserts, Rain forest ex.)They would also be able to add a checklist to guarantee that the kids understood the topic given. On the plus side, it boosts their grade up for the next school year too, start them up with a outstanding grade.

If a particular student is not doing well in said class or if students were to have a hard time, then the teacher can implement a less challenging project for the kid to their reasonable liking. Instead of them finding it too hard and not accomplishing it, they instead have a sensible feel to it. The student might forget how to do a specific thing or proper procedure or, all together; be to afraid or nervous to ask the teacher for assistance, they are free to ask their parents or other family members to help with the subject. They can even hire a tutor or go to institutes to help them understand the material and help them push forward and reach the extra mile. If the student has been born with a mental illness, such as ADD or ADHD, then the teacher can sit down with them before school ends for the year, and give them extra time and a run down with everything in it to ensure there are less bumps in the road while they are on break.

One far more advanced way it helps is in the long run. Teachers know that high school kids are getting ready to graduate and join the work force or go to collage. They do not want their students to be going into the work force or collage, after having long summers with no work and lollygagging around and being used to not having a care in the world about any sort of paperwork, and go to a more professional job that required a lot of work and paperwork that must be completed within the deadline. Though most kids will not understand until later in life, teachers are trying to give them a feel for what life will become when out of high school. Students will be aware of that upcoming afterwardssand prepare themselves for what lies ahead of their path that they choose. Bosses and Collages like people who know hard work, they like someone who can get the job done efficiently.

There is no reason why, a child cannot complete a summer project. Unless it is for a vacation that takes up all of summer, then they should have partially completed the project It would not take long, students would most likely finish in a week or so. It would be very beneficial to the student that it will get them a better grade at the beginning of the school year, help them improve over all and keep the brain active to the subject, and will help them in the long run with all that life throws at them. One day the students will understand how beneficial it is, most students just think short term, but in reality that tiny bit of information can lead them to fully understanding and memorizing the topic and getting them set up for a lifetime of goals and achievements.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
44DDD4D88456,"A project during summer vacation! summer vacation was suppose to be about having fun not doing boring old school work. Some schools require students to do projects over the summer. While some may say that the projects should be teacher designed, because the teachers know what they want the students to learn about. The summer projects given to students should be designed by no other than the students themselves. Students designing projects themselves will lead to many positive things, first students will actually do these summer projects, secondly they will be more engaged to what they are learning from this project, and lastly they will learn more about what they like personally.

To start off, if their summer projects were designed by students they would actuallly do them. Alot of times when the teacher assigns a project many students won't turn that project in at all. This results in conflicts such as bad grades. Most times students don't do these projects because they are not intrested in them. Summer is on of the biggest breaks students get from school, so why would they wanna spend it doing projects for school that are boring. Students share intrests, so if a student were to design a project that was educational but in common intrests of those around them. The other students would actually do this project because it's something they like.

They may even come up with partner projects that will help with students social skills. This Allows them to open up about things they don't understand about projects when they are in the class room.

Secondly, student designed projects will allow students to be more engaged in their projects. There is no kid anywhere in the world you can get to engage in something they don't like or want to do, unless you force them to do it. Well same goes for summer projects if a student doesn't want to do it they will not be engaged in it. Not engaging in things such as projects can lead to sloppy, messed up, and badly graded work.

This doesn't allow students to show teachers what they are really able to do. Other students know what their fellow peers strong point and weaknesses are. They can design fun and intriuging way to learn but also have fun while doing their summer project. When they do design fun projects like this it will let these students become engaged in what they are learning.

Finallly, student designed projects will allow the student body to learn more about their intrests personally. The whole point of school is to learn about the world and learning skills we will need when we grow up. Along the way you will learn youe strong points and your weaknesses. You figure out what you like and don't like doing. Taking your strong points and intrests to poin you in the direction you should go in. A project that's student designed for their own personally intrests will allow them to grow. They will learn all they can because that project will be something fun and engaging about something they want to know more about personally. This will let them flourish in the field they want to learn about.

In conclusion, Schools requiring students to do summer projects should let the projects be student designed. Students know what their peers want to know about. These projects will be more student based so they will actually do them. Activities they want to learn about is where you will find the students to be more engaged. When projects are designed by students it will be about topics they themselves are intrested in, allowing them to learn more about these topics. Students should design required summer projects because they are the ones doing the projects.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
65AA1348FD1A,"As many students head off for summer break at the end of the school year, a great deal of them quickly dispose of the information learned that year over the break. One may find an entire year's worth of material end up in the dumpster, easily forgotten and abandoned. However, to prevent this, some schools require students to complete projects over the summer to assure they continue to learn over the break. The projects can either be student-designed or teacher-designed. Although letting students design their own summer projects would let them express their freedom and creativity, summer projects should be teacher-designed, as they will better follow the next year's curriculum, enable the student to learn relevant information for the coming year, as well as allowing them to retain the previous year's information.

First, if a teacher designs the project, they will be able to ensure that the project will contain relevant information pertaining to the next school year's curriculum. For example, many schools' English classes across Generic_City in Virginia require students to complete a summer reading assignment. The book(s) to be read are chosen by the teacher of the next course and assigned by the current teacher, and are then used throughout the next year's curriculum throughout various assignments. Having the teacher, instead of the student, choose the book to be read ensures that the content learned follows the next year's course content. If a teacher designs a project to follow the coming year's curriculum, they can ensure its correctness by communicating with other faculty members that teach the next course and have them review the project, while if a student designed it, they would most likely not have that same resource and accessibility.

Second, a teacher-designed project allows a student to learn relevant information for the coming year. If a student were to design their own project, it is likely that while they would be choosing a topic that interests them, would not be relevant to the coming year. At Generic_School, for example, teachers of advanced classes such as Pre-Calculus AB require students to complete a summer project. The project contains a review of the content in previous math courses required to take the class, as well as an in-depth introduction to the course, enabling students to be more prepared for their first day of class. Were there no required assignment or students be allowed to create their own review and introduction, there is no doubt they would not be as prepared, as they do not have the same knowledge of their courses as their teacher. After all, it is a teacher's job to ensure that students be prepared for the next level of education; providing students with helpful information that will be relevant towards the next year will allow them to do just that.

Lastly, a project that is designed by a teacher provides them a chance to review the year's content, allowing the students to retain that year's information in a fun and interesting way. Like many teachers assign SOL review projects towards the end of the year, a summer project similar to that of the SOL review will allow students to be creatively engaged, as well as remember what they have learned. In order for students to be successful, they must first understand what they have learned or are learning. Having students complete a project not only allows them to do that, but also allows them to have fun and stay engaged while doing it; however, this task can only be effective if a teacher designs the project. Their expertise and experience prove that they know what they are doing- students, on the other hand, simply do not have the same credibility.

In conclusion, allowing the teachers to design a summer project rather than the students is not only smarter- it is more effective in a student's learning process. Having teachers design the projects assures that the students not only continue to learn over the relaxing break, but learn relevant information as well.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
D0A7DA572ED0,"Summer break is a time of joy for adults and students alike. However, for students their brains still need to be stimulated so that when they go back to their everyday school-lives they do not forget what they have learned. The means of producing that knowledge for students however, can either be from teachers or from their student peers. Although students should be assigned teacher-designed projects because their assignments are guaranteed to be curriculum based, summer projects should be student-designed because students are able to enjoy themselves over break, they are given the chance to be creative in their learning, and will not be stressed over the summer.

To begin with, students are able to design projects that will bring enjoyment to their fellow classmates. Pupils have common interest to one another, so they would be able to create a project that would be equally enjoyable to their classmates. As a result, this enjoyment will make students more willing to participate in their summer assignment because when someone enjoys doing something they are more apt to do it no matter the amount of time or work that goes into it. Furthermore, if an assignment were to be given over the break, that assignment should be something students enjoy doing. The reason being because summer is the season of enjoyable recreation and by allowing students, who are equally eager to have fun over the break, design said project they are able to stay true to point of summer.

In continuation, student-designed projects give students the ability to add creativity to their learning. On a regular school day teachers are the ones who decide how students will lean. Sometimes what the teacher chooses is only beneficial to a handful of students, and the others have to make due with what they have. By giving the students a chance to make a summer project, they can come up with a learning process that is geared towards their peers. Students feel more comfortable expressing the way they feel they learn best with their classmates, so by giving the creative liberty to students the product created will be something that benefits everyone.

Furthermore, with students designing their own summer projects they will not be stressed over the break. Students are aware of each others needs and their own personal needs, so as a result, they will create an assignment that will not overwork their classmates or themselves. The reason being whatever project is created by the students will most likely have to be completed by the creators too, so if they assign something that will take the majority of the summer to complete or cause a decrease in their mental health, they will have to participate in this assignment as well. However, if a teacher made the summer project they would not have to pay the same price. Which is why a project made by teachers will not be as mindful to the students need to de-stress and prepare for the upcoming school year as a student-designed project would.

Finally, students should design their summer project because they are able to create something everyone will love, they get the chance to think creatively, and they reduce the stress that comes with a summer assignment. If students are given the chance design the summer project the students will come back to school having better learned the material they were given. In conclusion, allow students to design their summer projects because the results would ultimately be very beneficial to all students. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
D5E3716C5E49,"I think students should come up with their own summer projects design because, students can come up with really creative projects, could have more fun doing their own design projects,and will have less stress over the summer.

Students can come up with really creative projects over summer by researching experiments, or about someones life. A student can look up science experiments to do as their projects that could be entrusting for the class or for them selves to. Also they can talk about a famous person or about someone in their family and explain why they wrote about that person. Students can invent new projects and show off to the class and explain how they came up with it and what will their invention help them or others.

Students could have more fun creating their own projects. Students will be more exited to be able to do create their own projects then follow a boring one a teacher assigned everyone. Students can come up with really creative work if you let them free roam. Students could in joy doing work that doesn't have to follow a checklist. Students could also can work on a project with their friends.

Lastly students can feel less stress about doing a project. Students will be able to work on a project without having to stress about it being perfect or if its following the checklist. Students can come up with their own checklist and show their classmates how they came up with it so the other students can do it one day for fun.

In conclusion, these our my reason why i think students should design their own summer projects.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
78B951722074,"Summer break has always been an important time for students to relax, spend more time bonding with their families, and travel to new places. Although summer is typically a nice and warm few months for destressing, I know that my summer is always packed with sports, trips, and visits from family. But what if the kids return back to school having completely cut off their school learning for 3 months? Schools then add teacher organized projects to the agenda, meaning for families there is always a week or more at the end of summer where everyone is cramming to get all their project work done. This almost constantly leads to less time to enjoy the end of summer, parents having to be involved, and unfocused, rushed work being handed in on the first day of school. However, there is a solution: Students design and lead their own projects, based off their own interests and activities. Letting students lead their own projects still assures that they are spending time learning, but eliminates several of the negative factors. Student-designed projects where kids can do a project that pertains to their certain hobbies and summer adventures are better than teacher-designed projects because kids would be more enthusiastic about the work, parents would be less involved, and the learning they would be doing is more valuable overall.

Last summer, I went to Italy and got to visit cities I had never imagined, learning so much about the history and culture. My summer assignments meant that once I got the the hotel, I wasn't napping ro relaxing, but up working on homework. It was uninteresting to me and tedious. If only I designed my own projects, then I could share with the teachers and school all the fascinating discovies I was making about Italy, and instead of sitting alone while my family was resting for our next excursion, record my beautiful day and turn it into a project that made sure my mind and writing and creative skills stayed fresh. I know that not every kid gets to go on a trip to Italy, but letting a student design their own project could mean they focus on a sport, job, or something they learned in school that they wish to focus in more on too. That would make it more likely for the kid not to forget about the project until last minute, because adding that element of enthusiasm would keep it not in the back but the front of their minds. Teachers would not be handed in rushed work but work that really reflects their student's character.

Another reason that student-designed projects would be more beneficial is that typically, when kids are confused about their teacher-assigned project or need assistance, it is necessary for the parents to be involved. The age effects this as well, because some young elementary schoolers may be incapable of staying focused on the project without support. For most adults summer break still means going to work everyday unless they are out of town. Since there isn't teacher access at home, the parents get pulled into doing way more of the projec than they should, whether the kid is just disinterested or struggling ont heir own. Student-designed projects would take away the parent's necessary involvement becuase kids can organize their own project based of their own levels of learning and understanding. They will be more interested as well so it is much more unlikely for them to be needing parental support. The home in the last few weeks of summer would no longer be a place for frantic parents and confused children.

Lastly, assigning student-designed summer projects would result in the child gaining a more benefitting and valuable learning experience overall. Children are much more likely to be passionate about their own projects if they feel as if it is uniquely their own. The research and skills would go in to more depth with more focus, for example, if I got to write about what I had learned in Florence and Rome instead of doing mindless work. Anyone is much more likely to benefit and learn from something they love and enjoy. It is also more likely for the kid to retain the information better if they have some sort of association to it, like research about a place they went or sport they participated in. Teachers would have students returning back to school with project in their hands that they are excited to share with their peers.

It is time for teacher-designed projects, which can be less interesting, stressful for families, and rushed, to be replaced by student-designed projects where students are independantly creative. Although it is good for schools to make sure all their children are not losing skills over the break, the same skills would be practiced if children got more freedom to design their own activity. Plus, summer work would be full of more enjoyment and acedemic value!",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
F711AD68730E,"Should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they keep their knowledge and continue learning during the break. There are those who believe that students should have teacher-designed summer projects but they are wrong. Although some may disagree, summer projects should be student-designed and not teacher-designed.

Student-designed projects would be way better than teacher-designed for many reason. Student-designed projects are way more fun. For example, teachers give out very boring and tedious projects in which students do not enjoy doing them at all. Students would designed projects that allow students to be creative and have fun while learning. Student-designed projects would be a lot easier than teacher-designed ones. Teachers put many difficult requirements on their projects, leading students to be tired and stressed out. Student-designed projects would be calm and simple, which would have no negative effects on them. Students could show their true capabilities on student-designed projects. Teacher-designed projects are pointless and only shows how well you copied notes. Student-designed projects can show if a student is creative and flexible they are.

There are more reason why student-designed projects are better than teacher-designed. Students are less likely to cheat on their projects. Many teachers know that students will cheat on their assignments but will do nothing about it. Even if they are caught, students will just find another way to cheat. Student-designed projects will reduce this because all projects would have to be different and creative in their on way. Student-designed projects will also be graded on a different scale. The way teachers grade their own project is terrible because they do not grade it on creative. They grade it on how well you looked on the answers online. Student-designed projects would be graded on how creative it is and how much effort you put in it.

Although some may disagree, summer projects should be student-designed and not teacher-designed. Student-designed projects are better because they are graded better by how creative they are, students will less likely cheat, show off their capabilities, have fun with it, and would be a lot easier than teacher-designed projects.

EB8D5B9798AE,"Schools that have a summer project that students need to complete must be teacher-designed.

Teachers have worked with their students for the year and they know what subjects they struggle on. They can design the project in a manner that would help the student remember information and teach them the subjects they had trouble with. Even though a student-designed project could also help, Students will choose something that they excelled at. It would not help them remember the other information they were taught that same year.

These projects could help students remember past subjects they learned that carried over to the next year. Furthermore, they can be built in a manner that can teach and remind students on the important subjects.

Students are much less likely to forget the information they learned if they practice it repetitively.

The project can also help encourage better study habits. A student who never studies can learn the importance of studying though the project. Additionally, it could encourage and motivate students to study after realizing how much it helps to study. Grades could rise and students will be happier.

in conclusion, most students dont learn at the same pace. They need practice to remember what they learn and to completely understand what is being asked of them. Student-designed projects would not help, because students would just practice something they're already good at. Teacher-designed projects can help remembering and can encourage better study habits, for students who can always learn more.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
D0D8097D243C,"Some schools partake in making their students create summer projects to influence them to learn over break, and to ensure that any and all learning from the previous year wasn't completely lost. Summer time projects should definitely be assigned but with the students engagement.

To some, school brings more bad than good, but with proper summer time review and practice it could get better for the student, if they had the steering wheel for a change. allowing the students to design assignments could persuade students to engage more in school if they made their own rules and regulation. To its avail, it sounds like an astounding, eye opening exercise to students and teachers everywhere.

Perhaps projects like creating a poster board about the Great War with very intriguing detail, lenient due dates and more. Or maybe the student chose to create an assignment on the water quality in foreign countries, these few ideas are only a very slim portion on how creative student could really be if they had the chance to design their own summer project.

In addition, if teachers continue to design the majority of the students summer time projects, consequently, the project assigned will be either completed to its minimum rather to its maximum, and not to mention the overall quality would definitely be dramatically decreased, this is because the students want more independence on the student designed assignment, rather than becoming more dependent on the teachers design. Allowing them to push and stretch boundaries they never knew existed, while letting the student enjoy school and the assignment at the same time.

Furthermore, students may do sports over the summer, enjoy vacation with family, have enrollments in other schooling, or may even have an occupation, regardless of what the scenario is, if the reins were loosened a bit to let the student design the summer time project, chances are it may make the student happier, and eager to do more summer time projects before the next school year begins.

Over time the student creating his or her own assignment will lead to stronger and improved memory development for the many school years to come. Designing an over the summer assignment could possibly may be fun to the student. With proper curriculum over the summer, it will definitely help the students who really need it most. Maybe for extra credit, better classes to take for the next year, or just as a brain exercise, Its still always healthy to keep the mind of a student functioning at all times.

To conclude, letting students design their own summertime projects to their convenience, could change the relationship between students and teachers for the good and in the long run. Allowing them to let their minds run loose, be filled with creativity, and to be excited for the next assignment could potentially allow for better communication within students and teachers.

6B292C385744,"Summer break can be fun for students, but is it beneficial to their learning? Over summer break, students often lose information they gained last year, so in response, teachers have been assigning projects to students to keep them engaged with school. Though, it has been called into question the value of these projects, as they are assigned by teachers, so students push them off until the last moment. Summer projects assigned by teachers should be student-designed because it promotes learning about interests, allows for more creativity, and is less work for teachers.

First, The student-designed project often helps students broaden their interests. Over the summer, students might pick up a hobby or interest that will benefit their future. Having the project be student designed could allow for some interesting projects. If a students project is turned in with all sorts of interesting facts, students could be encouraged to pursue that interest in depth, and, overall get a better grade on their project. If a student had designed their project, their project could reflect their interests.

Next, students should design their project, as it allows for some creative ideas. These summer projects are designed to be fun, and allow for exploration, but if all the teacher asks for is a PowerPoint presentation, than it doesnt look very appealing. Now, if a student came in with a computer-designed model of their project, or maybe a song, than they could think broader for next year, and allow for more creativity in the classroom. If these projects were student-designed, than it allows for creativity to be shown throughout their student life.

Lastly, if the project was student-designed, it allows for less work for teachers. If a teacher had to design a project for his or her students, then it could lead to summer stress, and teachers may not enjoy their summer break. So, if students designed their project, all teachers would have to do it assign the project, and grade it at the beginning of school. If students had more freedom with the projects, it would be less work for teachers at the start of the school year.

Teachers and experts often claim that if the project was designed by a teacher, than it would keep a student focused over the summer, and he or she would get their project done sooner. However, this is false because teacher designed projects are boring, and one student or more students will always wait until the last possible minute to get his or her project done. If the project were designed by a teacher, it would bring on more work for a teacher, as they have to assign, design and grade, and allow for more stress over the summer. If a student designed their project, it would be beneficial for all parties involved.

In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by students because it allows for engaged learning, promotes creativity in the classroom, and, overall, is less stress for teachers over his or her summer break. In our current society, students are more distracted than ever, with cellphones and video games; so, having a student designed project can benefit a student more, as it will not distract as much as a teacher designed. Students should talk to their teachers and administration at their school, asking for student designed summer projects. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8

Student-designed projects over the summer? What do you think about it? Summer assignments are usually given to students to work on during their summer break. Due to past references and experiences, teachers had always assigned students sufficient amount of work during breaks. The question given is should the summer projects be teacher- designed or student designed? Student-designed projects are done with the best interest of a student's perception. Although, summer projects should be provided or given by teachers because they prepare us for the upcoming year, students won't have to stress on choosing a topic, and it helps the students reflect.

Teachers are well aware of the upcoming materials that are required for a student to learn or perceive before they graduate. It is better if a teacher provides the project because it is done to prepare us for the next material. When given an assignment over the summer, students tend to work at the last minute before school begins. However, students are also learning material that they will be taking in the upcoming year. After doing the summer assignment, they are well aware of how much of a workload the teacher provides and what the expectations are for this class. If students are not comfortable with the topic, this gives them a sign that they need to switch or take a different class. It will also tell them ahead of time if they are uninterested in the material. This differs in some cases. For example, the subject mathematics. There are different types and topics of mathematics. If the student receives an assignment in the class, that work will assure the student if they are capable of learning and doing the material. If not then they should, in the best of their interest, convert to a different class. For reading or the English subject, teachers usually assign a novel for the students to read and analyze. The level of reading is what differs within each class. If the student thinks that the level of reading is out of their best ability, then they options that have a lower level or a level in which they can understand the topic. There are various options for students to take to fit their capability and that can be determined by what is provided by the teacher.

Teacher-designed assignment indicates that it is done by the teacher's best ability. This proves that the students would not have to spend their summer trying to think of a concept to write or think about. When they are given by the teacher, the students would just have to continue to work on the topic given by the teacher. As we all are notified of, teacher and students want to have a break from school and enjoy their summer. With that said, students would just have to complete the assignment handed by the teacher and submit in the beginning of the year. Students having to think of the topic and do the assignment may be too much of a workload and have the student be uninterested in it. Although teachers can assign work and let the student work and get creative. Creativity is what interests a lot of students. Working to show off or impress is what teachers like the most because they are able to get to know more about the student and see how some students can improve. They can also have that stress-relief coming into the new school year knowing that they will learn some of the materials in the summer assignment.

Lastly, teacher-designed assignments can allow students to reflect on the things they have learned. Some materials learned may appear again in their new year of schooling. Having teachers make the assignments can allow students to not diminish the material learned, over the summer. It is proven by many researchers that there is a higher rate in which students forget more than half of the material they interpreted during their school year on their summer vacation. This is caused by students not doing any sort of work during their vacation. When students do their assignment they will have a better chance of retracing the topics they have forgotten and revisit them. Once students touch up on the topics they forgot, they have a better chance of moving on to the new material than having to both and fall behind.

In reality, it is better when teachers designs the assignment because then they will be working on the material they need to learn rather than something that just interests them, they won't have to spend time thinking of what to do, and it allows them to self evaluate at the end of the year. Some people may argue that summer assignments should be designed by students. Many may say that students should work on their assignments on how they want to organize it. They think that teachers will assign a heavy amount of work that students may not want. Students may also think that the project will be to hard because teachers like to make work challenging for students. Some may like to work in their best interest and work on concepts that will interest them. Students like taking things on the easier pathway, and just have the assignment done. Although what teachers want is students to evaluate and prepare themselves for the coming year.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
25279CF8444F,"When the school year ends most students are just exited to know that they don't have to learn, knowing they can just relax, hang out with friends, or party. On the other hand, isn't this just holding them back in their learning process? Shouldn't they do some type of project that will allow them to exercise the mind and keep them learning? Well it is easier for the students and for the teachers when they come back from break and the students haven't completely forgotten everything that was taught to them the previous year, so some schools decided to have students do a project over the summer break that can help these students grow as intellectuals . Having said that, who should decide what project to do during the break, the teacher or the student?

Students are very lazy when they start to get closer to summer and to the break, they don't want to deal with the stress of the school. Having a project over the summer is the last thing that a student wants to do, so if they have the option of choosing what to do they will always chose something that isn't going to challenge them in anyway and will chose to do a easy topic that they can get done fast, that they already know, or that they have done before. For students summer is supposed to be the break from school and going out and having fun with friends and family, having vacations, and having a project to do over the summer break isn't really a break anymore. Summer break is more of an excuse for students to have fun and not worry about anything, but if you put a project for them to do they understand that they have to get it done while having a pretty long time to do it right, others will leave it for last minute. However this over the break project gives students about 2 months to get it done without having to be stressed, being able to do it at their own pace. That is why teachers assign the different project to each student, because they want the student to succeed by giving them something that, as a teacher, they know what they outcome would or could be and for the student to be challenged, yet doing something they can comprehend.

Even though students are the ones doing the project, teachers are the ones who understand the subjects that student should be learning. If you let a student pick a subject to work on over the summer, he could chose something very unnecessary that would have no impact in the students growth as an intellectual, he could say he is doing a science project that would ask how many hours he can play a video game before he gets hungry and eats food, or before he has to go to the bathroom. Teachers who got to know and understand their students throughout the year would know what they could be interested in and would work on during the summer. For students to be interested in something they want to understand how it works and find it fun to do. In order for students to not slack off and procrastinate they must find it interesting to them or they wont work on it. That is another thing that teachers must considered when giving out the projects that their students must do over the summer, if teachers assign the same project to everyone, many of them can get such projects done fairly quickly and not challenge them at all, having it done so soon they didn't learn anything for the project, or having all of them do the same project would just have them copy each other. Having teachers know their students strengths and their weaknesses, can help the teacher determine what project the student can work on that they will enjoy doing and will challenge them, helping them learn all at the same time.

All teachers want for their students is for them to be successful, in order for them to achieve such success they need to understand and go though the challenges that they have to face and the failures they must grow from in order for them to grow their knowledge as an individual. During the summer break, students benefit from having a project that can help them keep the knowledge they gained though out the school year, and not having to be shocked back into the next school year when they come back and have to re-learn stuff from the previous year that they may have forgotten, after that they can finally move forward and learn new things. The teachers give out this project for the whole purpose that given project helps students move forward, they assigned the project to the individual students knowing what would help them grow without having the summer break erasing everything they learned the previous year. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
9C2D29720675,"During the summer, some schools will assign projects to their students in order to further the students' studies and to keep them learning. Some schools might have teachers design the projects and assign it to the students while other schools will have the students design their own projects and then they will work on the projects that they designed. Both sides have their advantages and disadvantages but, overall, student-designed projects would be more beneficial to students as they would have more motivation to work on the projects, it would be more interesting and fun for the students, and because they would be able to learn better from the projects.

One big advantage that a student-designed project would have over a teacher-designed project is that, when working on a student-designed project, students will be much more motivated to work. When somebody designs or creates something, they tend to appreciate it more than if it were created by somebody else. As a result, if the students were to design their projects, they would appreciate it more and work harder on the projects. On the other hand, if a teacher were to assign a project that they designed, the students would just see it as another assignment that the teacher has given them and most likely not work very hard on it. As a result of this extra motivation, the students would be much more productive when working on the project.

Another advantage that a student designed project would bring is that the students would be much more interested in the project if they were the ones that designed it. When a student is given the opportunity to design something that they would later work on, they would most likely make it as fun and as interesting as they can possibly make it. They would have a much easier job making the project interesting and enjoyable than the teacher as the students know themselves better than the teachers. If a teacher were to design a project, they would most likely make a much more boring and uninteresting project that the students would not care for. As a result of this increased interest, the students would be much happier and be more energized when working.

On top of this, a project designed by students would be much more effective at helping the students learn, which is the main purpose of the project. Some people might say that teacher designed project would be better and more effective as it is the teachers job to teach the students, however, that is not the case. If given the option, the teachers would assign a project that they think the students would enjoy. However, the teachers might not know exactly what interests the students and what the students find fun. As a result, the teacher-designed project could be very boring and uninteresting to the students. On the other hand, if students were able to design the project, there is a guarantee that the students would be interested in it as they would be able to design the project around their interests and they would also add elements that they would find fun. Furthermore, in the summer months following a long school year, the students want to relax and have a good time. If they were to receive a boring project from their teacher, they wouldn't have much energy and motivation when working on this project which would take away from the learning experience. The student-designed project would be much better at getting the students to learn the material.

Overall, student-designed projects are much better than teacher-designed projects. While working on a project that they designed, students would have much more motivation as they would appreciate the project more. Students would also be more interested in their project because they wouldn't want to make a boring project for themselves. Furthermore, students would have a better learning experience as they would work harder on the project. Ultimately, student-designed projects would be more beneficial than teacher-designed projects and, if a school were ever to assign a teacher-designed summer project, the students should present the alternative of a student-designed project to the school.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
D88A1D12032B,"Yes I think that the projects should be student designed because then the student has the opportunity to learn whatever it is that they wanna learn.

personally i think that when i get to choose what i wanna learn about it makes it more intriguing to me and always has me wanting to learn more. if it is teacher designed then that means that you might have to learn about something that you really dont want to learn about. i know for a fact that when someone tells me to go and learn something its not the same as me WANTING to learn about it, i just have no drive to do the work because i feel like im getting forced to learn about something that i really dont care about. Especially during summer i dont want to learn about Robert E Lee or something because in my own opinion i think all that history stuff is the most boring stuff in the world. kids dont want to earn about that,they wanna learn how to make a video game or how to make music. nobody wants to learn about the great Gatsby or even trigonometry. we have always been told our whole life we need to graduate high school and go to a decent college to be successful in life or to even have a good job. that is not true but its what we believe because its what we were told since we could do basic math. our whole lives we are being controlled and we dont even know it. we dont ever choose what we get to learn the teachers choose it for us. i dont wanna be a historian maybe i wanna be an R&B singer or learn how to mix music maybe even create a video game. you cant do all that inside school, sure you might get a little taste of what you wanna learn but they will never teach us how to be successful in something that we are actually passionate about unless its math,science,English, or history. i honestly think its bull crap, yeah i think we should learn the basic history and basic math like algebra one something we could use in a day to day life situation. who in the world is gonna need trigonometry every single day or when is it gonna play a big part in someones life? rarely ever. and its crazy that we basically have to spend 4 years learning about things we most likely dont wanna learn about. people always say chase your dreams but how are we gonna be able to do that when we have to go to school to learns things that arent going to mean anything to us in about 10 years. ive talked to my parents they dont remember learning anything in high school. i show them my homework all the time and they just say ""what in the heck is this?"" to my math problems that im apparently going to need all my life. college is probably the most pointless thing in the world you do not need to go to college to be successful in life there are jobs in this big world that will pay you more than what a lawyer gets paid. with technology in this day and age you can become a millionaire by sitting on your butt all day and playing videos games. not even making one just playing the game. i shouldnt have to waste like 8 years of my life when i can legit be doing anything in the world but school is stopping me. i could probally be the next big thing in rapping but i dont have time to focus on it because of school. so no i dont want some stupid lame teacher picking me some boring lame topic for me to learn about i want to pick what i learn about for once. let us have some freedom. there are so many things i wanna learn about but i have to spend most of my day at school not even paying attention because they teachers never teach anything interesting. maybe if they did people who arent goody two shoes and dont get As in every single class they ever took would probally pay more attention and maybe then these black kids wont become just another statistic espically because yall make it so much harder on us african americans in school. we dont want to learn about that bull. we want to learn about cars, motorcycles stuf like that some normal boy stuff. girls dont want to learn about punctuations or how to write a dang essay. maybe they wanna start their own makeup business or something. i just dont think school is fair really. i think its a big waste of time. period. ",2,Summer projects,Independent,0.2
15BDCD238E51,"Some schools require students to complete a summer project. Even through teacher can be a great help, I believe that summer projects should be student-designed. I feel that students should be able to design their own projects because, it can help expand their minds, self creavity, and helps them get used to making projects threw the school year. So learning should never stop even on break. It's good to keep learning, and it helps out a students thinking process to keep are brains healthly.

Most students create a project about a subject that their most instersted, or about something they like; an object. In these process, students are trying to find facts about the subject or object like where is it made, how was it made, what is it about, and etc. If it's an teacher-designed project the subject or object would be the same for everyone, which would takes the fun out of the project for students. If a teacher gives you a project over a break where the students have to create a project with the choosen subject, most students forget about the project, and last minute finish the project because it's not what the students want to create. If they student creates the project on their own, it makes students more instersted in creating they want to do.

I believe all students should be able to create a project on their own through out are break time outside of school. Summer projects is also a good way for practice to kids that are from other countries moving into a United States school. It also, gives them more oppurtunity to learn about America and teach others about where their from. For example say a student moved from South Africa to Califorlina. That person will see palm trees, sunny days, large school buildings, and all type of things they never seen before. As that person moving from so far what can you image in your head that person would want to make a project on. They start to learn a new words and start speacking in english. If a teacher-dissigned that persons project you maybe never get to know there background story in life, and how they grew up because they couldn't make a project that they created. The more humans think, the more we learn and that helps keep are brain working and healthy, because the more we learn the smarter we get over time.

In concusion, I believe that the summer projects should be student-designed because it makes students want to complete the project over the summer, it helps students get more creative, and expands their things to learn new thing kepping their brain active and learning.               ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
B90C8C40C0A0,"Summer projects are immensely helpful in order to keep your mind active and intelligent when your're not in school, constantly stimulated by academic subjects. However, the summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher designed. Students making the projects know what will help their peers learn throughout the summer, they know what they have truly learned rather than what teachers assumed they have been taught by other teachers, and they have the opportunity to showcase their creativity and passions through the project they complete. In order to be most successful, students should have authority to be creative and responsible for their summer projects.

Summer projects purpose is to continue the growth of your mind when you are out of the classroom for about 90 days. A lot can happen to adolescents over the summer, a lot of things that anyone who is not in the same phase of life can truly understand. Many teenagers find sanity with their peers and friends in this time frame of growing up. As seen and extensively studied by Erik Erikson, Erikson came to the consensus that when you are going through the school-age stage of life you begin to pull away from your parents and adults to find yourself and find your independence. In result, you grow more drawn to your friends and peers, due to them understanding the phase of development you are going through. The connection students have with each other is something that can not be matched by teachers. No matter the background or clique a student is in they all have one major characteristic in common that connects them, they are all students. Teachers have not been in school in years and they don't connect with the same things as this generation does. Teachers did not have the same technology, pop culture, or even the same societal standards as today students have. Student-designed projects will create a project they know is going to reach their student peers in a way that connects to them and the modern day times because they are experiencing it, along with them.

Throughout my school years, I find myself stressed and concerned every year when I receive a new teacher, after a long and carefree summer. The teachers have so much faith in their coworkers and the retention of the knowledge that according to them ""we should have learned in years past."" They begin to assign ""easy"" and ""refresher"" work that they assume we have been taught. The lack of communication between teachers is a hard burden on students due to their past teachers exclaiming that ""you do not need to worry about that, your teacher next year will teach you,"" and your present teachers thinking that you had already learned it in your past courses. As the student, you are left with the sense of delusion and dissatisfaction on why you lack this important skill and learning target. You struggle to understand basic fundamentals of learning and when you are assigned a project you begin to sweat the little gaps in your learning. Every student knows this feeling of remorse of being assigned a project on material you just havent been taught yet. Students who design the projects know what they and their peers have been taught and what they all lack because they have all endured the same classes and teachers. Students designing the projects can develop a project that will set them straight for the new academic year and go into school after the summer feeling confident and legitimately feel the work from teachers is a ""refresher"" not a degrading of their intelligence.

The creativity of generation Z is outstanding and unique to modern day society. The opportunity for students to create the projects would be extraordinary and expressive of our generation. The use of creativity is very limited in school. You are to be complacent with the standards of your school through the strict rules and regulations they place. Many of the rules you are given are not only rigid but not needed. Teachers set boundaries on students and rarely let them experience and express their own style and flair. When students are allowed to indulge in their personal ambiance their limits are endless. This is embodied through art and the publishing of students in modern day. More books written by teenagers are selling on the shelves today, than ever before. When students get the opportunity to express themselves and their creativity they begin to showcase their natural talent that you cannot see when it is hidden behind the standards of learning and learning targets set by teachers and the school board. The teachers teach every student the same in order to maintain a consistency and basis of learning. By doing this they lose the chance to see the passions and talents of the individual students. Consistent learning is needed but teachers lack the understanding that every student is different and have their own learning process and strengths. Modern day students recognize the differences throughout their peers and themselves. They notice that the differences unite them and it is ordinary to be different. Students who create the projects will implement the material to be expressive of their peers because they have the same mindset that comes with being in generation of identity and self-expression. Teachers do not see this aspect of learning they see learning targets and standards.

Student-designed projects would implement effective, continual learning over the summer break due to the students connection with their peers, knowledge of common learning gaps, and the generational need of creativity and self-expression. The purpose is to continue learning while not being in a classroom, but how can we continue to grow our knowledge if the students can not establish a connection with project due to being out-of-touch with modern day and the mentality of today' students. Therefore, in order to achieve maximum learning, students should be tasked with the project design. ",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
17F339479482,"Summer is the time for students to have fun and enjoy their break to the fullest extent. However, it is also the time when students forget all the knowledge they learned in school. To prevent this from occuring, schools require students to complete summer projects. The students' experiences and knowledge could provide a unique design to their summer projects. Therefore, summer projects that are assigned to assure students continue learning during their break should be student-designed because they will have more freedom to use their creativity and they will have less stress by doing something they want to do.

To start, students are capable of developing something creative when they are given the choice to pick what they want to do. For instance, a student can think of many impressive ideas to base their project on. Forcing a student to work on something they did not choose limits their creativity and decreases their interest in the project. In addition, when a student cannot pick their project, they tend to turn in something horrible. If students are allowed to work on something they feel passionate about, they will put the effort to develop something of good quality. Therefore, students will make an outstanding project if they decide what to do.

Furthermore, students will be less stressful. School work is an unavoidable stressor that causes students to turn in bad work. If teachers design the project, some students will be stressed because they might not know what to do. For example, a foreign exchange student can be assigned a project about American traditions. The student's stress will rise due to not knowing anything other than his countries' traditions. As a result, a student's lack of knowledge about an assigned topic will lead to the stress of knowing they will receive a bad grade. Also, stress can have a negative impact on vunerable students. To illustrate, students who do not handle stress well can stop enjoying their summer and fall into depression or anxiety. There are many students who are scared of humiliation in front of their peers; presenting a bad project will not only increase their stress but it will decrease their self-esteem. In summary, working on a teacher-designed project will increase students' stress levels.

Although a teacher can design a project that will encourage students to learn something new, students will feel more confortable working on something they want to work on. It is for this reason that they should have the liberty of choosing their project. In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because they can be creative and students will not be stressed.        ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
6FEEBA3EFAE2,"School is over and summer time is finally here. For some students it is the only time they have to feel free. Some schools often feel the need to give work to students during the summer. The work they give students can at times be a little boring. Teacher and students always have this arguments about who should make are summer projects ,should the teachers or the student make them .Many feel as if the teachers should make it because they are more experienced,but I on the other hand feel as if students should able to make their on projects. By students making their own summer projects it lets them show what they've learned. It will also promote more students to actually do their summer projects..Summer projects also show the next set of teachers know what they need to expand on more. The summer projects were made for students to get a chance to develop and grow over the summer.

Students making their own projects would be a great idea. At the end of every school year students should come out knowing more than they did in the beginning. Moving forward to the next grade students should be able to show what they've learned and know. The summer projects are a great way for students to better develop what they've already learned. Students don't do the work just to do it they do it to learn . When students can show you what they've learned it means the actually know it. Some may say if they only show what they know how are they expanding their knowledge, if they show what they know they end up getting better and better eventually you will be able to branch off to do bigger and better things. It's just like cooking if you do it over and over you'll get better at it and eventually you will be able to branch off. The summer time is a great time for you to expand your learning , you could come back and show your teachers what you've learned. There are so many games and sites that can help you develop .

When students are able make their own projects they can make it however they want. If students make their own project they can actually make it fun. Which can promote them to actually do the work. The summer project that the school assigns can get pretty boring. For teens you have to have something that grabs their attention. If they aren't excited about it they aren't going to try their best. Some students have short attention spans .When students are able to create something they really want to do they put their all in it. Students always wants things that are exciting and fun. It also has to be something that they are passionate about. You can't expect them to do something if they don't like it . A student is not going to do something if they dont like it . Some people say that if they make the project they aren't going to do anything because they are going to be playing all the time,students can control themselves when it comes to something when it come to something they really like.

The summer projects were created so students wouldn't forget what they learned .Some students end up forgetting what the learned. So the summer project are a great way to show the next set of teachers know what they need to expand on more. Coming from a long break and then trying to go back to learning is kind of hard. It's only hard because some students forget what they learned or either taught themselves. When they come back from the break the teachers can go over the projects to see what parts they struggled on. Teachers don't always give students a refresher. Some students need a reminder when they come back from a long break .You may need a reminder in a certain subject because it all connects .For instance in math you take all these maths and some how they all connect. You need a refresher for the last subject so you can succeed in the next part. Learning may be hard for some people ,but if you have that one teacher that ca refresh what you've learned everything will be better.

Your always learning there is no way around it. The little things you do can make a difference .Students are given special things like projects to help expand their learning. These projects are students ways of showing people that they know what they are doing and that they learned something. These things were created by the school now its time for the students to take control.                                          ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
3EEDE8AD3CB3,"Summer break is oftentimes associated with the stagnation of learning, and the loss of accumulated learning from the previous school year. To counteract this, some schools have implemented a system of summer projects to ensure that learning never stops, even during a break. However, in lieu of traditional teacher-designed projects, students should be able to dictate, for themselves, what summer project they wish to accomplish. While some may argue that student-designed projects encourage lazy and uninspired design, by designing projects themselves, students are more likely to have the time and motivation to complete them than if a teacher had designed them.

By having students design their own projects, it increases the likelihood that they have some interest in the completion of said project. This is because by allowing them to dictate what their project is about, it ensures that the student will select a topic that is interesting to them. This concept of self-selection is already applied to schooling today. For example, the ubiquitous science fair. Within a science fair project, students select a topic and create a science experiment surrounding that topic. By allowing students the freedom to select and design their own science experiment they are interested in, they learn and engage more than if they had, for example, participated in an in-class lab. This is especially important for a summer project due to the fact that, during summer break, students would rather relax than do school work. Especially so if the alternative was to work on a project that they had no say in creating. Essentially, ensuring students are assigned a project they are interested in ensures that they accomplish some learning over their break.

However, laziness is not the sole reason a student may not complete a summer project. It is possible that they, or their family, have plans that conflict with the completion of an assigned project. For example, if a student were traveling to a location where they did not have access to resources or materials to complete a project. Or, if a student took on a summer job and the assigned task was too time-consuming to work on in conjunction with their job. There are a variety of reasons a student may not be able to complete a project. It is impossible for a teacher to take all possible factors into account for each of their students to design a project that is compatible with their summer plans. By allowing students to design their own projects instead, each student can individually design their project in a way that is compatible with the existing summer plans.

On the other hand, some may argue that allowing students to design their own project encourages the design of lazy, easy, and uninspired projects. After all, why would a student intentionally design a complex project for a time span intended to be a break? However, both teacher-designed and student-designed projects open up the possibility of lazy work. Teacher-designed projects will inevitably suffer from lazy work while student-designed projects can suffer from lazy design. Either way, students will find ways to work less over their break. However, this assumes that students can design their project without supervision. By requiring teacher approval of a project, teachers can ensure that students design a project that is worth completing, while retaining all other benefits of a student-designed project.

While some may argue that student-designed projects will lead to lazy project design, this can be easily negated while also ensuring that students have an interesting project that they are able to complete over their break. By allowing students to design their own projects, they can choose, for themselves, an interesting topic that they are interested in studying. They can also ensure that the completion of the project is possible within their own summer plans. Student-designed projects lead to project interest and completion more than any teacher-designed project ever could. By having students design their own projects, it ensures a unique and interesting learning experience over their summer break.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
3170B51DC0BE,"How would one feel if a teacher said that every student would be taking the exact same courses in high school? Everyone would feel very uncomfortable because they are forced to do something that they may not like. Well, this is the same scenario as whether the summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. These summer projects offer the students to test out their skills and find out what they are proficient at. Summer projects should be student-designed because they can choose projects/topics that they are familiar with. Unlike teacher-designed projects, student-designed projects offers a far more widespread of new opportunities.

My first reason to why summer projects should be student-designed is because they can choose projects/topics that they are familiar with. For example, in the summer between 7th and 8th grade, the Geometry HN teachers assigned the incoming students an essay about geometry where we could write about anything related to the subject. Since I was allowed to choose what to write about, I decided to find real life applications of math and I was able to correlate these applications with basketball, one of my favorite sports. I wrote about how the basketball scoring was related to addition, how the court dimension was related to surface area, how shooting the basketball at certain angles/distances helps the ball go into the net, and etc. People should expect students to succeed at student-designed projects because students can choose topics that they are good at. Another example, in the summer between 8th and 9th grade, was when the students were given a book to read,

The Other Wes Moore . When school started, we had a Socratic Seminar about the book in my English 9 HN class. However, most people either hated the book or did not read it because that book was not a fan-favorite genre among the students. I was not able to finish reading the book because the first page was so boring that I would have rather watched paint dry. If the students were authorize to choose their book, they would be able to pick books from their genres or even books that they can personally relate to.

My second reason to why summer projects should be student-designed is because, unlike teacher-designed projects, student-designed projects offers a far more widespread of new opportunities. If everybody was assigned the same area of science for the science fair, then everybody would do very similar projects. However, student-designed projects allows students to try out new things and figure out whether or not they are good at it. For example, when choosing my 6th grade science fair project, I was originally going to choose an area of science that I was already good at, biology. However, I wanted to challenge myself, so I chose to do a project that revolves around physics, balancing. After I executed this concept to my project, I knew that it would take a while because I was new to this field. Once everyone was done with their project and their presentation, the results came in and I ended up getting second place in the whole school. Student-designed projects encourages students to not shy away from trying new things. Another example, in the summer between 6th and 7th grade, was when students were given an essay prompt to write about rather than letting us choose our own prompt. The prompt was about ""would you rather be in jail for 10 years for a crime you didn't commit or would you rather commit a crime and live with the feeling that you could be caught anytime."" My friend, Generic_Name, was completely stumped on what to write because he was not very good at writing essays, which is why he took English 7 HN--in hopes of improving his essay-writing skills. He ended up failing that essay due to lack of freedom given by the teachers' choice of the prompt. If Generic_Name was able to choose a prompt that and not be limited to one, then he might have been able to succeed at that essay.

As a result, some people may argue that teacher-designed projects creates a fair environment to everybody because every student has to the same projects. However, all this does is encourage more cheating because if every student is given the same project, then students can ""work"" with their friends to finish this projects faster. For example, in the summer between 9th and 10th grade, the students were given the same Pre-Calculus HN summer packet. To finish this faster, my friends and I each did three pages (total of 15 pages) and sent the completed work to each other. We completed the packet in less than 3 hours and got full credit for it all because we had the same thing to do. If students have to same assignment as others, then they will easily take full advantage of it by ""working"" together. Whereas, if students are allowed to choose their project, but not be able to do something that has already been done, they every student will succeed.

In conclusion, student-designed summer projects prevents cheating, creates more and new opportunities, and allows students to choose what they like. If teachers design the projects, then they are basically controlling one's decisions because they aren't allowing the students to widen their skills. So, answer this question again: How would you feel if a teacher said that every student would be taking the exact same courses in high school?",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
37FC9DB2D1DB,"When assigned a project during summer break, don't you wish you could have control? Students should be able to design their own projects because it's their summer, improve learning, and students can be creative with it. When making a project these things are what you look forward too. Students need their minds to go wild and enjoy the project especially if it's over the summer. Their summer to be specific because no student would want to stay at home stuck doing a project if it's not fun for them. Especially if their friends are out having fun.

The first one is obvious, it's their summer. No student, in any grade, would want to be stuck with a project to do over their summer break or any break. Students dont even want homework over any type of brake. Therefor they should be able to design their projects. This should give them a little more freedom over break instead of being bored overall. It could help students have fun while doing their project as well as getting a good grade.

Second, is when doing a project it could help with bonding. This could work in one of two ways: The first being a family project and students get to do a family tree. And second being a group project and friends stay over each others houses and get to know each other more. In benefit of all this is making a new friend or friends. And a bonus is getting a good grade. Summer's are supposed to be spent with family and friends. Enabling students to design their own projects can open up so many new worlds.

Lastly, allowing students to design their projects will improve creativity. What students look forward to in a project is how fun it could be or how much fun could they could get out of it. So allowing students to design their projects can help improve not only creativity but learning. Students want to go all out and when they get to see that opportunity it's amazing what students can do. It's overall amazing what is in a students mind, they just need to let it all out. This also helps them as they arent pressured to stay in the standards of the project.

The only bad side anyone can possibly see in this is the topic. Students, when let lose, can tend to get off topic and not realize it. They get to caught up in their mind that they lose what the requirements are. This isn't a bad thing but it tends to happen. Overall students want to have fun with learning. It's already boring enough to do homework so cut the students some slack.

In conclusion, students should be able to design their own projects. Its not only their summer but their time with family. It could help bonding with not only family but with some new friends, and it could make summer a lot more fun. And also improve creativity as all students want to let their minds free when making a project. They want to see how much they could get out of something so making students design their projects is the best way to go. Let their mind flow and enjoy not only their project but summer as well. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8

When summer break comes along, students tend to forget stuff of what they have learned through the year. Noting this, if student would create their own project they might not do it very well because they wouldn't know how they would start it or if they are doing it right. On the other hand, when teachers give advice and instructions to the students, they do better then trying to figure out stuff by themselves. Even though we probably know what we are doing it is better to know that you are on the right path. Sometimes we students just need a bit of a push to start us up.

Teachers may affect a students way of being able to see things differently. For example, we learn more things when they are being taught to us rather then us trying to figure out ourselves. Having someone there for us helps us get farther since we have more support. When teachers design a school project, students know step by step on how to do things when the instructions that are given. We also know more things of how to do it the right way. Students can be great at designing things, but teachers can help us more since they know what we will need throughout our future and what it will hold for us.

In order for teachers to be able to teach, they have to go through school themselves. In this case, teachers know what is important for us and what will help us go farther in our future. When teachers design their own project they can check if students are doing it right by making them present them. When students present their project the teacher can tell if they did something wrong and can help them fix it right away, but when students do their own projects it would be harder for them to understand what part they messed up and how would they be able to fix it. Work gets more easier when you know what you are doing.

I would be able to understand on why people would think student select is better than teacher select because students would be able to express the things they know and remember. By dong this, students can show on what they have learned from what the teachers have taught throughout the school year. This is a good thing but it is better to be safe then sorry and be sure that we all are on the right track. Another reason might be that students would be able to get creative with their projects and i agree with that, but what would be the point of them being creative and doing it absolutely wrong. When you do a project that you made yourself you won't stay on topic for some time because the information being placed would be about anything.

teachers do a lot for us and help us get into the right path for our careers but they also want us to know the important things we will need in are lives. They want us to be successful and help us understand things that we might need later on in our lives. They will be their with us every step of the way to show us and let us understand on how to do things right and help us understand things so it can be more clear. By doing this, they give us instructions on how to do better so this is why my opinion is 'teacher select project' is better and has more advantage of 'student select project'.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
FAF91DDF582C,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to guarantee that students will continue to learn during their summer break. It is essential that students keep learning even though they are taking a break from school, but these summer projects should be teacher-designed. Why should a students not be allowed to choose a project of their liking? Well, the student's teacher will know what that person needs to work on. If a student were to choose what they would like their project to be about, they could probably decide to work on something that does not require much effort; therefore, it would be best if a professional particularly assigned a certain topic to help his or her pupil designated to help them grow and become more efficient in their academic life. However, if the student believes that there is a specific topic they believe they need to practice more than the teacher should consider to make an exemption.

Students would certainly benefit if they were given homework over summer. This action would ensure that the student will be ready to tackle classroom assignments once they are back to school. Not only that but it would also let the student perfect their skills and be prepared in class. These projects designated to students will surely boost the alumni's knowledge and confidence on that specific topic. Therefore, the student will not struggle as much as they would have without the extra help.

In addition, if teachers assign students particular homework designed to help their alumni be more efficient in class, it is undeniable that their student's classroom performance will have a positive effect in their academic life. The teacher ,being a professional, will have more understanding of what their student needs to work on. He or she can personalize the project to better help the student understand and learn about their assignment. The extra help given to the alumni will have positive results and they could use their knowledge acquired by the project on other classes, or these young adults can use this information outside of school to help them handle outside of school life situations. If trained professionals give students homework during summer break, then those students will be able to see how this extra work helped them master skills when school opens again.

Students should not be given the privilege to choose their own project assignments. Some students would pick easy topics that would not require them to put much effort, this will deeply harm the student academically. Instead of working hard to perfect an area in which the student struggles, they would rather choose something that is easy and would get done quickly. This is why it is better if teachers gave students their assignments. However, it can not be guaranteed that the students will learn or understand the homework assignment. For that reason could be that maybe the student is not ready to take on that particular topic. Without a doubt, it is known that not all students learn the same way and not all understand what they have learned. Everybody learns at their own pace and in their own way. If the student believes that the designated work is too hard, or maybe too easy, then they should talk to their teacher and suggest a different topic. Also, if the students thinks that there is another area they need to practice more, they should ask their teacher to consider their request.

Schools that require students to continue learning during the summer will see positive results in students academic lives. Designated work from teachers will greatly help alumni master and perfect classroom skills. Not to mention, students will acquire more knowledge on these areas with the extra help that was provided. If the teacher knows what their students need to work more on, those students will soon be ready to take on anything once school is in cession again. If students were given the liberty to pick their projects, would the students actually learn from it? What happens if the student chooses an easy project, when they could have been working on some other topic that they know they have trouble with? This will certainly not be a good idea. As professionals, teachers know what is best for their students if they have been observing their classroom performance. However, Many teachers sometimes overlook a few things in which student have trouble with. When this happens the student should take a step forward and let their teacher know what it is they think they need to work. This way the teacher can look back and verify is this person does need to practice more in the areas that they may be struggling.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
BBE5305DAE8E,"Have you ever done a summer assignment? Would you rather have it done your way or the teachers way? Summer projects should be teacher-designed because the project will be more focused on what will be learned in class, the project will be more structured to what they're looking for, and the project will be useful to the student.

However, some people may argue that if the project is student-designed, then the student would be more engaged. For example, in ninth grade, the English department demanded an essay written during the summer. When the teacher started collecting papers, I was one of two students who turned in a paper. Almost all the students didn't do the summer assignment. So if the summer assignments were student-designed, then more students could perhaps be more involved. Nevertheless, there are other viewpoints to consider.

To begin with, the project will be more focused on what will be learned in class. For example, in seventh grade, my English teacher required that you write a paper about what you did during the summer. I didn't know what kind of writing she was expecting, but with this essay she was able to tell what we needed to work on. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers will focus on what most students need to learn. This is only one reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed.

In addition, the project will be more structured to what they're looking for. For instance, just like on the writing SOL, there are directions; they are looking for something specific. They are looking for a thesis, transition words, and more to see what you've learned. When you include all those elements that the grader is looking for, you will pass. Summer projects should be teacher designed because you can do all the things that they expect out of the project and you will get a good grade. There are more reasons as to why a summer project should be teacher-designed.

Finally, the project will be useful to the student. Consider as an example, I read about ""the curve of forgetting."" In short, over time, you forget things at an exponentially increasing rate if you don't review the materials you learned one day. The purpose of summer projects are to make sure students keep learning over their long break, so that they don't experience this ""curve"" as much and keep it almost as fresh as when they did learn it on the first day. The project will be useful to the student because they will use this learning in the classroom when they return to school. The claims and evidence stated above all lead to the same conclusion.

In conclusion, teacher-designed summer projects are better than student-designed summer projects because it's more tailored to the class, it's better for the grader and the student, and the information learned will be used in the class and future classes in the same subject. For summer projects to be teacher-designed matters because we need useful learning. I want you to think about if there was a time when you had to do a summer assignment where it was up to you to decide everything. How did it go?",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
6AB3E21421F5,"School may end when summer starts, but that doesn't mean that a student's learning has to! Today, many teachers assign summer projects to ensure that students continue learning over summer break. However, many are conflicted on whether or not these projects should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Summer projects should be student-designed as this encourages a student to learn independently, be interested in the subject they are researching, and gives them the opportunity to pursue independent topics outside of the restrictions and guidelines of a teacher-designed project.

Without the guidelines and restrictions of a teacher-designed project, students are free to research on their own and create unique summer projects. Assignments given by teachers during the school year usually have a certain set of guidelines and restrictions to ensure that a teacher receives the same type of work from each student. While this may be useful in some situations, it does not encourage independent learning and thinking. Without the basis of guidelines set by a teacher, a student is free to use the project in any way they want and learn about any topic. For example, in biology, I designed a project that determined the effects of humidity on callus tissue production in plants (callus tissue is a tissue that heals cuts in a plant's exterior). This topic was not discussed at all in class but the student-designed layout of the project allowed me to research into any science topic I want and come up with an entire unique project design. Since I was learning this subject independently, I conducted my own research and designed my own experiment, allowing me to gain valuable skills in project-design (a skill that can be useful in the real world too). This student-designed project not only allowed me to research an entire new subject, it also helped me learn valuable skills in project-building and experimentation as I was free of teacher restrictions. Student-designed projects, thus, encourage independent learning and thinking among students.

Student-designed projects allows them to have greater enthusiasm for the topic they choose and study. If students can design their own projects, they would have higher self-motivation for the assignment as they chose what they wanted to do. For example, in school, I am interested in some subjects more than others. Some subjects, such as chemistry, are a hassle for me and I, personally, do not find any interest in studying it. Because of this, if I were assigned a summer-long project on chemistry, I would definitely not be fully invested and would be quite reserved and unenthusiastic about the project. However, if I were allowed to freely choose the topic of my project, I could choose a subject that I more thoroughly enjoyed, such as world history, and thus, be more enthusiastic about the project and spend my summer studying something that I love. Without the restrictions of a teacher-designed project, a student could spend their summer pursuing a subject they enjoy and, thus, produce a better project and also would feel that the project was less of a burden as well.

Student-designed projects allow them to foster interests in other subjects outside of school. Student-designed projects means that the project can be about any subject and can be made in any way. This gives students a platform to make a project about their passion or an entirely new hobby or subject that they are interested in. For example, I once spent a summer learning how to program as it was a relatively new subject to me. The idea of being able to assign a computer a task and it being able to respond back to me was quite interesting and, because of this, I was quite invested in the assignment and spent my summer learning something completely new. Students could experience the same thing by spending the summer learning about a new subject that may end up becoming a passion or hobby for them. With this, they learn new things and spend their summer doing something that they enjoy and may continue to enjoy throughout the rest of the year. Because of this, student-designed projects allow students to pursue potential passions outside of the restrictions of teacher-based projects.

Student-designed projects are an excellent way to ensure that a student is learning throughout their summer. They encourage a student to learn and think independently and and be interested in the subject they are researching which can lead to a passion to develop in a subject. These projects are also excellent in removing the burden from a teacher-designed project and the restrictions that come along with it. Most importantly, it reduces the stress a student may have and their summer to be what it should be-- taking a break and enjoying yourself. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
CE7153D68C2C,"Some schools require students to complete summer assignments over summer vacation to assure that students are still learning. These projects can take the form of summer reading, a study guide, or other means to gain background knowledge about the class. Summer projects are used to help make sure that students keep learning over the summer, and so they come to school in the fall prepared. Because summer projects are supposed to help students prepare, some question whether the projects should be designed by students or teachers in order to ensure the students learn. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because this allows for easier grading, gives students an idea of what class will be like, and actually assures that the student is learning.

Those who oppose this may say that student-designed projects allow the students to choose freely. They argue that free choice by the students will allow the student to be more interested in the topic and actually learn more. If students can freely design their own individual projects, then they may put more effort into the project and make more of an attempt to learn. While this may be true, if every student has a different project design, then it will be very difficult for teachers to grade. If the teacher designs the project then the teacher can create a rubric to easily make sure that the student actually learned over the summer.

Teacher-designed summer projects allow for easier grading, because a specific rubric can make grading easier and more equal. For example, if a high school English teacher has 30 students who all design their own project, the teacher will have to grade 30 completely different projects to see if the student learned. This may be difficult because one student may make a presentation showing a time line of specific events in a book or novel, while another student may write a research report on the usage of different parts of speech in common language. These are completely different topics and mediums of presenting information that relate to English, but the teacher will still have to grade them equally. This will be difficult for the teacher, because the projects have very little in common other than being related to English. The teacher may have a hard time giving a fair grade to students, because the projects are so different. On the other hand, if the teacher designs the project, then they can grade the projects equally and easily. Even if the project design is as simple as ""make a presentation relating to English,"" the teacher can still grade each project the same because they all have something in common other than relating to English. The teacher can then grade the projects quickly and easily to be able to move on and teach throughout the school year.

Teacher-designed summer projects show students what class will be like, because the summer project will likely be similar to assignments they will receive in class. For example, if a teacher designs the project to be a research report, students can infer that the rest of the class will be research related. This will prepare students for the class, and help students know what skills they need to improve on in order to be successful in the class. Students will be able to see what they are struggling with and have a chance to reflect and improve before the school year begins and their grade is negatively affected. For example, if a student is not as good as researching and writing research reports, they will know that they must work on researching. They will only really be able to know if the teacher designs the project. If the teacher designs the project, then they can help students learn not only the content of the class, but also the skills required to be successful in the class. This may not happen with a student-designed project because the student may not know what the class will entail and they may design an easy project, only to be surprised when the class utilizes learning techniques other than the student had practiced with their summer project.

Teacher-designed summer projects actually assure that the student is learning. For example, a math teacher may assign a packet or worksheet over the summer to show students what kind of math they will be learning in the school year and what they should already know going into the class. This allows the student to return to school prepared for a more difficult class. If the student designs their own project, they may want to work on easier subjects from past years so they do not have to think as much over the summer. They will show up to class unprepared for more difficult learning, and may struggle in the beginning of the year. The teacher knows what the students will need to learn, so the teacher should design the project. Teacher-designed projects show the student what they are up against, and force the student to learn over the summer so they are not stunned in class.

In conclusion, summer projects should be teacher-designed because they allow the teachers to more easily evaluate the students' work, shows the student what kinds of assignments they will recieve, and shows the student what to prepare for once school starts. Teacher-designed projects will be easier for the teacher to grade, because they can be of uniform design be graded equally. Additionally, they show students what assignments will be like and show the student if they need to work on different aspects of their work, such as research. Finally, teacher-designed projects will show students what aspects of curriculum they need to work on, such as different types of math. On their own, students may not be able to learn the curriculum or work aspects, so the teachers must design projects to help them out. When given the choice between a teacher-designed summer project and a student-designed project, choose teacher-designed in order to help the students learn and prepare. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
8508D4805CEC,"I think students should be able to student-design their own project over summer break. This would be a better idea because then students can pick a topic that they are interested in or want to learn more about. Also students should assign their own projects because they could have more ideas on what they could do about their project. Students deserve to pick their own topic becasue then they don't have to stress over their topic that much and they can pick something easy to do their project on so their brains get a break and don't have to think about it as much.

I think that students should assign their own projects because then they can pick a topic that they find interesting or a topic that they want to learn a lot more about. Students can do a lot more when they pick their own topics because then they can pick something that will not be hard to find a lot of information about. Also if they pick a topic that they are more interested in then they can have a lot more ideas on what to do for their project. Then they could have a better chance at doing well on their project because they can find a lot of information, be creative and have fun with it at the same time.

When summer time comes around, students don't want to be working all the time. They want to focus on summer and not have to think at all. Picking their own topic would be a great idea. If students pick their own topic and they pick something that they already know a lot about. Then students wouldn't have to think as much and can do their project as they please. Also they wouln't have to stress about it because they have a topic that they love. Also they can put so much effort into their project.

When it comes to summer students want to relax and not think about school or learning. So I think students should pick their own project and then they can get more done with this project. Also when they pick something that they love then they have a much better chance on doing well on this project. Teachers love to see projects that are well-done and they look like someone put the effort in. Students will have a great amount of time to work on these projects. Some students may get their projects done in a week then they don't have to worry about it which is great also.

24AB166876CE,"It is pretty much guaranteed that a majority of people will be assigned a project in their lifetime.

Among those people, a good amount get assigned a summer project, in order to stay educated over the long summer vacation.

On most occasions, summer projects are designed by the teacher, who already has a set plan on what they want their students to learn.

There are many advantages to doing a summer project that way, but summer vacation is the best time for students to show their full potential and creativity, and design a project themselves.

Summer vacation is the peak of student creativity.

The mind is truly set free as students embark on different adventures of their own, like traveling.

These experiences could provide ideas, and influence the student on their project.

Not only traveling, but hanging out with friends or family could help influence a student's project.

Even though a project designed by the teacher is already planned out, it does not provide the student with a good chance to be creative. The amount of opportunities and fun to be had while on break could potentially be a playground for the student's mind, which then blossoms into pure creativity, ideas, and a very good summer project.

If students designed their own projects, there would be a large amount of difference and diversity among them, which is a great chance for students and teachers to learn more about each other.

An example a science fair.

Everyone studies something different, but you learn more about them and their topic.

The fact that each student is able to let their mind run wild and design something different from everyone else leads to new healthy learning experiences.

Although a teacher designing the project could benefit the teacher, like knowing what to look for, having students design the project is advantageous for students and teachers alike.

A student designed project is beneficial on the whole, and is a perfect learning experience.

Letting a student design their own project is truly letting them shine.

It is a chance for them to show off skill and interest.

If a student is allowed to choose their own topic or design the project the way they want, there is no doubt that they will excel.

For example, for a reading assignment, if you let a student choose their own book instead of one chosen for them, there is no doubt that they will finish it much faster.

A teacher could provide a very good topic and format, but if a student can pick for themselves, it will surely turn out good.

If they pick their own interests or their preferred format, they will make the most of their summer project.

Finally, a student-designed project is good for a students grade.

Letting their topics and formats be chosen and planned out by them will let them succeed tremendously.

Even though a teacher-designed project does make it easier and quicker to grade, there is a good chance a student would not be as interested, and the student would not do their absolute best.

Not only will it greatly help their grade, but they had full control and fun while making it.

Although teachers can plan out a very good project, a student-designed project is a perfect opportunity for all.

A student can show their creativity, skills, and interests.

A student can be different and learn more about others.

A student can get a better grade and have fun and complete freedom while doing it.

B4E9FFCFC9FB,"Summer vacations is a blessing and a curse. It provides approximately three months of free time for students, while also providing three months worth of opportunities for students to forget all they had learned in the last school year. To combat this, there are summer activities designed to keep the academic engine running in preparation for the upcoming school year. A student-designed summer project is a motivating drive for students, is personalized by the students, and encourages responsibility and accountability.

Motivation is the driving force of all work. Tasks are more difficult to complete, or even start, without a reason for performing such a thing. A student-designed summer project, in name itself, can be quite the motivator amidst the lax summer vacation. It incentivises participation by having the student choose how they wish to execute their task. It also incentivises completion in a similar matter, with a mindset along the lines of ""it will be easier to finish this on my own terms"". The average student is very fickle with their preferences after all. Beyond their own self-drive, a spark of creativity is encouraged as well.

Nothing is more satisfying than your own work. Just simply having a finished product to call your own, a product crafted by you alone, is incredibly satisfying. A student-designed summer project is customized by the student and for the student. This allows personalization that acknowledges a student's strengths and weaknesses, such as time management or particular skills. It provides personal input that encourages students to speak for themselves while still abiding by the guidelines. However, a personal voice is not the only useful skill they can practice.

Later in the school life, and, eventually, even beyond, students must hold themselves accountable. For example, if their score on a test seemed incorrect, the students are responsible for double checking with their teacher. They can practice these habits with a personalized summer project. The students are responsible for their choices and actions. If they want to try something new, they can try it, as long as they are held accountable for it. If they make a mistake, it is okay, as long as they take responsibility for what they have done. However, their is still difficulty in trusting students.

Whether from elementary school, middle school, or high school, students are not always trustworthy. There are many who learn to work around restrictive school systems, or formulate lies to get past skipping classes or cheating. Just allowing a student to craft their own method of studying and practicing is just begging for trouble. It is possible that students can be lazy and procrastinate. They might even take the easy way out by putting in minimal effort. It is true that such freedom can be troublesome. However, that is only one side of the coin. There are students who are trustworthy, or more willing to work and improve. It is worth the shot to let these young minds practice helpful skills and maintain a studious mind.

A personalized summer project crafted by students provides motivation to work and encourages the practice of responsibility. To improve, one must understand their strengths and weaknesses. To perform, one must have a reason to do so. Even if students are as fickle as they are, they still deserve a chance to create their own method of studying and practice. A summer vacation is a chance to relax, but it should not be a time to forget.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
BDC4070CF21E,"Summer assignments can be very beneficial in ensuring that students are continuously learning, but the question at hand is, should students personalize their summer assignments or should a teacher-designed standardized copy be given to every student? Personally, I believe that students should be able to design their own summer assignments because only the student knows what they need to improve on, teachers may attempt to take advantage of this opportunity by assigning a tremendous amount of work and one standardized paper does not facilitate each individual students needs or learning styles.

Then again, some may believe that it is better for the teacher to design the assignment, because the teacher knows what students need to improve on, so the teachers would provide students with exactly what they need to practice. They might also believe that if a student was to design the assignment, they would purposely make it simple and deny themselves the opportunity to learn. They may also agree that teachers should make the assignments because the teacher is in a position of power in the classroom.

Although, the teacher is responsible for teaching the class, the student is responsible for knowing which areas they need improvement on. Every student is different, one student may find challenging, another may find it easy. For example, in my geometry class, most students find proportions simple, whereas I find them rather complex and challenging. If I were to design my own summer assignment for geometry, I would include a lot of proportions to ensure I get the needed practice. This is just one of the example of how students know where they need improvement and how a student can help promote their own success.

Teachers are meant to assist students in excelling at the necessary curriculum in order to pass the course, yet some times they overbear students with work. Many teachers would take advantage of the summer assignment and give students too much work. Summer vacation is meant to be a break from school, if students have loads of homework to do, they will not be able to enjoy their time off. Students would then have to make the choice between losing quality time outside of school doing schoolwork or disregard the assignment completely and enjoy themselves, most students would end up picking the latter.

Thirdly, no two people are the same, and no two people learn the same. Some students learn better visually, so their summer assignments should include many videos, some students learn better kinetically, so their summer assignments should include hands on activities, and others learn better by hearing, so their summer assignments should include audio material such as pod casts.

In summary, I believe that students should be able to design their own summer assignments because, they are the only ones capable of knowing what they personally need to improve on, teachers may try to take advantage of the summer assignment and assign too much work, and everyone learns differently so students should be able to tailor the summer assignment to fit their learning styles.",6,Summer projects,Independent,1.0
815EE0AF066F,"Everyone has heard that over the summer you lose some of the knowledge your learned over the school year. To combat this teachers are assigning summer projects to keep their students engaged in learning wile there on summer break. Some believe these projects should be designed by the students, but I believe these projects should be designed by the teachers because they know the curriculum, will challenge the students, and provide clear instruction on how the project is to be done.

First off, the teachers know what the students will need to know for the next school year. As a student I pick the classes I want to do the following year, but over the summer I usually don't prepare for those courses. Although, over the past two I have had teacher assign summer projects to help ease me into the courses I will be taking. Those summer projects may have seemed like a nuisance at the time, but when I went back to school I felt very prepared for the new courses I would be taking.

We all know that nobody wants to do summer projects, so if the students designed the projects they would all be super easy and nobody would learn anything. This is why the teachers should design the projects because they will challenge the students. The summer of my sophomore year, in my biology class, we had the choice of designing our own project of letting the teacher design one for us. Most chose to design their own, but I chose to let the teacher design one for me. As the school year ended and summer began most of my classmates who chose to design their own project were trying to quickly finish their projects so their summer wouldn't be affected. This defeats the purpose of summer projects because they are supposed to challenge your brain throughout the summer. While my project on the other hand, was designed to last the whole summer by making me do small assignment throughout the summer.

Last but not least, the teachers will provide clear instruction on how to complete the project. Lets use the example I talked about above again. Since my teacher designed my project I knew everything she wanted and knew exactly how to do it. Furthermore, I also knew how to pace myself so the project would last the entire summer and not take up too much of my time. On the other hand, the students who decided to design their own project had to plan out and make every instruction, which isn't impossible, but it's hard. And sure enough many of those students had trouble finishing their projects because there where some flaws in their instructions.

Summer projects aren't always fun, but are needed if you want to retain the knowledge you learned over the school year. And as explained above, if they're designed by the teacher they can be quite enjoyable because they provide clear instruction, challenge you, and also know what you will need to know for the next school year. In the end, summer projects provide a valuable learning experience, especially if they're designed by the teacher. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
10738FAB1350,"Some Schools require students to do a project over break. But should the project be student-designed, or teacher-designed? Projects over break should be student designed. For one, students could make there project on something they learned a lot about, and something they were interested in. Another reason students should pick there own project is that they will run wild with it. If you let them pick there own, they will try there hardest to make there project great, because it's something they connect well with and they want to show the Teacher. And finally, its over break, which really should mean that they are work free, so if your going to give them a project, at least make it one they can pick from.

If I were a student, and I was given a project over break, and you were told it had to be whatever they said, you probably wouldn't do it. And if you did, you probably had a little trouble getting all those facts. But if you were allowed to pick from something that you wanted, it would get done with ease. You could pick somthing you're comfortable with, and something that you learned a lot about. If the teacher picked it for you, and you didn't know a lot about it, you would have to start from scratch and do a lot of research, and that would waste a good break.

If you were to give a student a resticted project on somthing they have to do it about, they can only go so far with it. If they didn't know much about that subject, or if they just didn't really pay attention. They arn't going to do as well. But if you give a student a project based on what they want to do it on, they will be able to take it above and beyond. They will know so much about what they are presenting on, it will be like there own personal project, that they can even teach the Teacher about, because of how well they know it.

As a student right now, I know how awsome it is to have a break. Just some time to sit back, relax, clear your head from all the stress, and anxiety build up, and take some time off to enjoy yourself. But, I also know how it feels to have a break, and some teacher-assigned project thats due first day back. It is harder than normal school life, because you are trying to get that project done, that you only know a little bit about, and make time to enjoy yourself. Its more stressful then just going to school. But, if you are given a rubric, and you are allowed to make a project on whatever you want, you would be able to enjoy making it, and you would have that time to yourself.

In conclusion. A student-assigned project over break, would be a million times better, than a teacher-assigned one. There is not as much stress, because you know about what you are presenting on, and you can still enjoy your break, because thats what there for. So, maybe if you are given a teacher-assigned project over break, go talk to him/her about it. Tell him/her personally that, you would like to bring in a project based on what, you learned about. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
E3EA6FB5390E,"In my opinion, if students are required to do school work during the summer, they should at least get to choose the topic of their project. I believe this because students have to take time out of their summer to create the project. Also, it could be more enjoyable for the students, if they created it on a topic theyre interested in. However, participating in a project may be stressful to most students if a teacher designed it.

Firstly, if students are assigned a project during their summer break, then they should at least have a choice on what their project is about. I believe this because students have to take the time out of their summer and create a project. In my belief, this unfair to the students and is time consuming. A project may take many hours out of a students day because of how long it may take to create one. For instance, if a teacher designed a project, it may be difficult for students to understand. Instead, if a student designed their own project, it may save time and be easier to complete.

Secondly, if student's design their own projects, then it may be more enjoyable for them. For instance, if student's were able to choose the topic of their project, then it may be easier to complete. In result, student's may find this more amusing, rather than a teacher designing their project. Also, student's may be more creative and passionate towards their work. Overall, their project may be more eventful if student's are doing it on something they chose

Thirdly, student's may encounter stress. Student's may encounter stress during a project if they feel restricted to one idea. For example, if a teacher designed a project, it may be difficult for student's to understand their teacher's point of view. However, if a student created their own design, then it most likely would be easier for the student's. Overall, stress levels may increase if student's dont understand their teacher, yet if student's have a variety of options to choose from, their project may be more amusing.

However, from a teacher's point of view, a teacher designed project may seem easier for student's. For instance, a teacher may believe a teacher designed project may be easier for student's since their is topic already portrayed.

Also, teacher's may believe their project design is fun and intriguing to student's. However, i assume teacher's try to plan amusing project design's, but students opinions may differ. Overall, teacher's may try to make it easier for student's by giving a design, but instead it may increase stress for srudent's.

In conclusion, I believe summer projects should be student designed instead of teacher designed. In my opinon, teacher designed projects may take a great amount of time. Also, it may not be as enjoyable. However, students may feel restricted to one idea/topic. Lastly, students may feel stressed or overwhelmed by a teacher designed project.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4

Although this is frowned upon through most sutdents eyes and wanting to determine what they have to get done, their teachers know what they have to achieve to ready themselves for the next grade.

Schools should require teacher designed assinmnets over the summer to ready their students for the upcoming year.

Schools should require teacher designed assinmnets over the summer to ready their students for the upcoming year. Even though many student believe they are mature enough to assign and design student based summer prjects, they do not know what is in store for them in the upcoming grade. My aunt had always been a straight A+ student athlete, getting great grades while playing a sport, she had also had a job working at a restraunt down the street from my grandparents house. She had always had an idea of what to expect, because of the mnay assignments he had been assigned to complete before the school year started. Many students go into the school year blind and have to figure a way out of the darkness, but if teachers create summer project for their students to complete, students will have an idea of what to expect from their teachers and the work load that carries over with them.

Schools should require teacher designed assinmnets over the summer to ready their students for the upcoming year. Most summer times are used for having fun and hanign with friends in a teenagers mindset. But as teens get older they are needed to be more responsible and act as young adults. My uncle had struggled with school through highschool wanting to succeed but could never. He had always turned things in late and procrastinated until the last second. Until he had to figure out that the adult life is coming around the corner, he had started to turn things in on time and get the good grades by teachers personally assigning him stuff to work on over the summer to help him get ready for the school year and showing that being responible and orgnaized will help you succeed through life. Teacher designed summer projects will help students prepare on how to be responsible and complete their work on time and not preocratinate until the last second and prove that being responsible and completing work on time will help them through life.

Schools should require teacher designed assinmnets over the summer to ready their students for the upcoming year. Many student will not have the right abilites to challenge themselves as hard as they should be, even though they are asked to design challenging student based summer projects. Most kids in school do not challenge themselves as academically as they should. Kids goof off until the last min until assignments have to be turned in late and asking for mercy to their teachers what can they do to get their grade up. Students are never up to challenge their academic capabilities and could not create student based summer projects. Students would try and find the easy way out. Teacher designed summer projects will help students prepare to be challenged through the upcoming years and work around the problem instead of trying to hit right through it.

Being responsible, turning in work on time, expectations for the new year, and being challenged through summer assignments are a big take on how students will preform through their school year. Even though teacher based summer assignments are frowned upon, they will help the age of students ready for their school year and strive to working harder, faster, and smarter. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
BB5B7EE4A1A6,"In young adult life, such as the high school years, many students lack responsibility. This is because society does not put enough trust in teenagers to make their own choices and decisions; thus, stereotyping a whole generation with negative connotations. For this reason I believe that the summer projects should be student designed to help better their own generations reputation and develop valuable life skills.

Many student grow up always being told what to do and how to do it. This does not allow for any creativity or original thoughts to be generated all by ones self. For example, when I was a child, my parents would lay out clothes each morning for me to wear to school. Not only did this limit my creativity, it also limited my self identity because I was unable to express myself in what clothes I wear. This so called favor that my parents would do for me caused me to never learn how to dress myself in a reasonable fashion for the appropriate setting. Just like how the students will never know how to design their own projects if the teachers do not put any faith in the students for just this one summer. The teachers will be able to see a students best representation of his or hers creativity and level of learning because they will have something to prove to society. To show everyone that they are able to do things on their own or independently. The students need to have the teachers and society's trust to exceed what is expected of them because society will never know what these students are capable of if they are never given an opportunity to prove themselves. This will better the generations reputation if done correctly.

These students need to be prepared for college and the real world outside of school, such as the work force. For example, if a child wanted to play soccer you would not just sit them in front of a television and watch soccer games. This might be a good way to teach them the general idea of what soccer is but they will never be able to learn the skills that are necessary in the game. That child will never learn how to pass, shoot, kick, or even have the social skills to communicate with his team mates. This goes the same for any other activity. The teachers in this school are treating there students just like this child. If they just give them the summer project and tell them to complete it they will never learn the skills of self-management and creativity that they would develop while design their own summer projects. These are valuable skills that students will need later in their own life time. The most important part of school should be teaching these valuable skills to make the students more independent rather than just the curriculum.

Some people may believe that the curriculum is the most important part of school and that is why the teachers should be designing the summer projects. They would argue that some students would fail at the task of designing their own projects. However, even if the students fail at this task they will learn from the failure. They learn what they did wrong in order to develop more skills and when the next opportunity comes they will not fail. Either way fail or succeed the students learn different types of independent life skills that are very valuable and needed for adult life.

In conclusion, students need to be better prepared for the independence that comes later in their life, whether it is college or the work force, these valuable life skills need to be learned for the ability to succeed in any area of life. For this reason I believe that the summer projects should be designed by the students for the chance to prove there worth and develop key skills that are required in adult life. Do not limit what a student can do based on the stereotypes around their generation. Let students have the opportunity to represent what they know. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
A4689CAFDED9,"Over the summer some schools require students to complete a summer project. These projects do help students academically but, you tend to see the best results when the projects are teacher designed. Teachers have a better insight on the curriculum rather than a new student who knows very little or anything about the curriculum. Therefore, summer projects must be teacher designed so that students can have guidelines, accurate grading systems, and work that will help them prepare for the upcoming school year.

First and foremost, students need guidelines when it comes to doing any kind of project. If you do not show a student how to accurately do something they may turn in their work and it could be the complete opposite of what the teacher wanted done. For example, a teacher's summer project could be to write about your summer experience and include pictures. With no guidelines, a student turns in a two sentence essay and a picture composed of one stick figure. But if that student was told to include six paragraphs and pictures taken from a camera, then the results would be different. Although, one may say that guidelines provide the student with a lack of creativeness there may be a student who does not have a creative mind. In this case not only will the guidelines help that student, but they will provide the student with a plan on how to properly complete the project.

To add, teachers must design summer projects so that students can have a accurate grading system. If students were to design summer assignments, the teacher is limited to grading on simple things such as completion, creativity, or even neatness. For example, a student could spend hours working on a summer project. The student completes a neat project but it has nothing to do with the class curriculum. Since the project is student based, the teacher is now forced to give a superior grade for something that does not correspond to the curriculum. One can argue by saying that having a strict grading system causes students to stress over school work during their summer break. But, the summer assignments along with the teachers grading system could prepare students for how the actual class will be once school starts. This will cause less stress during the actual school year because students will prepared and know what is expected of them.

Last but not least, students need to have a teacher designed summer assignments so they can be well prepared for the upcoming school year. Teachers know the curriculum and grading system before students arrive. So the teacher could help by assigning a project that corresponds to what topic they will be covering first. For example, a teacher is starting off the school year by teaching division. The summer assignment is to find out the definition of division and write about three times you had to divide something. The students feel more confident going into class knowing the have insight on the first topic at hand. To argue one could say that students may have a easier time completing a project they designed. But overall the purpose of the summer assignment is to help with the learning process. Which is why it is more efficient to have teacher designed summer assignments because they know the upcoming curriculum.

To conclude, teacher designed summer assignments make for a better academic outcome. Students will excel when they have specific guidelines to follow. They will not struggle with the classes grading system. Most importantly students will feel more than prepared coming to class on the first day. Student designed projects may help the creative side of the students. But overall teacher designed projects will help with everything the student needs to be successful. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8

inter is made to work hard. Summer is made to party hard.

This quote from Riccardo, the protagonist of the Italian movie

You are doing it right, is the perfect summary of what students think when school come to an end and in front of them are just two complete months of hot sun and fun. Of course this is not completely true; the goals one achieved during the school year are not eternal and docents know it. Assuming this, is right to think that they want to help us keep track of what have been done in the year during our holidays.

For a better learning experience, summer projects should be designed by teachers because it will be easier for students, it will make work faster for the teacher and the projects can be effective once the students are back to school.

Some may argue that teacher-designed projects not always reflect ones interests and may result in an harder work because of that. For example in the book

Every exquisite thing, the main character struggle in her history class because of assignments that do not touch her interests, but she find herself doing great with her Literature teacher that leave her more freedom of choice. In the same way some people may feel that their personal opinions and interests are left aside because of designed project, nevertheless there are other viewpoint to take in consideration.

To begin with, is right to think that summer breaks are made to spend time with family and friends, discover and travel or simply relax after a year of hard work. Students are more likely to complete a task quicker and better if this is assigned and designed by teachers. For example, Aristotle, the famous Greek philosopher, said that his words are the mean that led people to knowledge and without this mean his followers would be lost and left in ignorance. In the same way a teacher's job is leading students to knowledge and, to use a parallelism with Aristotle, projects are the mean by which they (the teachers) can help teenagers.

In addition, teachers will not have the problem of reviewing dozens, if not hundreds, of different projects. From my personal experience of teacher assistant in my school back in Italy, I can say that there is nothing longer than analyzing and correcting other people' s job; even more if always different. If my teacher had the possibility to design the same project for the whole class, our review would have last two days instead of two weeks.

Finally, teacher-designed work have been shown to be more effective. A survey, conducted by the Italian Minister of Instruction proved that summer projects are essential for students, but are more effective in cases where the topic and the design where chosen by the teacher. This is because with a guidance and clear instructions students could focus more on the content and avoid wasting time over subjects not related to the work. For these reasons it's essential to underline the importance of teachers' help not only during the months in school, but through the whole year.

Like a caring mother, she took me under her wing and taught me everything she knew wrote the author of

Turtles always come back referring to the help that an English teacher gave to a student of her struggling after the separation of his parents.

C57EBACC6802,"""Sorry Generic_Name, I wont be able to go to the concert, I have to finish doing the summer reading project and its due by next week."" Imagine having to do a summer project on a beautiful sunny day,I know it seems horrible. Most of us can agree that summer projects have interrupted something pretty interesting. When it happens to me it makes me feel like a flower in need of water, all sad and gloomy. ""Why do we have to read out of this list all these books, they are all

BORING."" Generic_Name exclaimed. Its always hard to understand why we need to read out of a curtain list and have so much requirements .But we can only imagine how much of a ciaos it would be if everyone was to pick a different level of books ,some challenging and some below their standard level of reading. Although students can make a project of their own its always better to have something organized by a teacher ,in my opinion it sets a more serious setting in the students minds. I believe that teachers should design the summer reading project because it avoids confusion,is more organized and it shows the way the class will be taught in the upcoming year.

In our lives most of us can agree that we have a felt some sort of confusion while completing a task. Thats the reason why I believe teachers should design the summer project that way Its simply to avoid confusion. We all know teachers have more experience in making things sound a lot more simple. They could make a confusing paper full of instructions very simple for students to understand. Students could always contact them via email or by Google classroom for more clarification. As a student I have been stuck and confused many times and by experience I can say that contacting a teacher always helps me. For example last summer I didn't understand what types of connections I had to make in relation to the book that was assigned to me. In that moment,I thought to ask the person who assigned the assignment , I quickly sent my teacher an email and she replied with a more clear and helpful paragraph.

Another reason why I agree that teachers should design the project is because everything would be more organized. Although students could make the assignment a lot more fun I believe it would not be organized .Teachers could make a packet and ask for specific things that are more beneficial for students to look over. Some of those things could be main topics that will be taught during the year. Since a teacher is far more experienced then a student at knowing methods to reach success, teachers could design the project to be more efficient for the students learning. That could mean picking from a curtain verity of books ,the type of genre, or the type of reflections that the teacher wants the class to focus on.

Summer projects can always be a good way to dive in to the new school year .With a summer project many things can be set clear, Like the way the class will be taught. This way the student can realize and understand if they will be struggling and that also makes it clear to the students on what they need to focus on studying. Its basically a good way to introduce the class to things they will be taught during the year. Although teachers are good at making a very well strong structured project students could make the project a little more fun and interesting. Its always fun to see the creations that students have in mind. Instead of having a boring lesson a student could have a way to reach the attention of the students. Overall Making the class be more engaged in what they must learn to be successful.

Many teachers often find summer as a break line in the students learning. Here in Virginia the summer vacation is about 3 months without the teachers assigning a project the students would not mind touching a book. Summer projects are really not for the teachers sake its for the good of the students. I believe teachers should design the project because its a way of keeping things organized ,and structured in a way that is not only beneficial to the teachers but also beneficial for the students. ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
BF0ADF374100,"Summer break is a time for students to relax, but students should continue to learn. In addition, summer is also a good time to start preparing for the future. Summer projects should be student-designed because students will have more freedom, be better prepared for the real-world, and it would be more enjoyable.

Summer projects should be student-designed because it gives students more freedom. The projects are the student's, not the teacher's, so they should have the freedom to design their own project. Since it is a summer project, schools should not have many restrictions and give students independence. I attend Generic_School where everyone has a year-long research project that is entirely student-designed. Everyone can do their project on pretty much anything they want; for example, I am creating a water filtration system for a school in Kenya. Being able to design our own projects has allowed us to enhance our creativity, problem-solving skills, etc. We are given much freedom, which has been so beneficial to my classmates and me. Students should at least be able to design their own projects when some of their break time is going to be taken away.

Student-design projects would be much more enjoyable for students. Teacher-designed projects resemble classwork and thinking about school and homework is the last thing a student wants to do during their break. If projects are student-designed, students would be able to incorporate something they are interested in into their projects. Since the project would take away time from their summer break, schools need to try to make the them at least a little bit enjoyable. If students like their projects, then they will be more motivated to work on it. If they are teacher-designed, most students will be unmotivated and probably wait till the end of summer to start it. Personally, if I do not enjoy a task or activity, I will procrastinate and dread doing it. In addition, the quality of my work is much better if I like the task I am given.

Schools should make project student-designed because it will prepare students for the real-world. Student-designed projects would prepare students for the future. They are much more realistic when compared to teacher-designed ones because in the real world, bosses do not guide or assist their employees. Us students are going to be doing the designing, not our future employers. The number one goal of schools is to prepare students for the future, therefore summer projects should be student-designed.

Summer projects are importanat because they can shape students and help them grow. They need to be student-designed because this gives students more freedom, better prepares them for their futures, and makes the project more enjoyable. Schools need to take into consideration the feelings of students' and their futures. ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
8BB4CE5D8355,"When assigned a summer project, students should receive the project from teachers. When students are assigned projects from their teachers, they are more likely to work and finish it, as it will be turned in for a grade. Furthermore, when students are not pushed to complete something, they often dont worry about turning it in on time. Having teacher assigned projects will prepare the students for future material, allow help to students when they are struggling, and force students to turn their papers in on time.

Often, students are assigned projects to help with upcoming material that they will be learning. Having a teacher that knows what material a student may be learning in the future can help to prepare them and give them more time to learn about something.

Students struggle more when they are not given enough time on a learning target, but when assigned a project in the summer that goes over the material in advance, it can help a student have a better understanding of the topic. Also, when a teacher assigns a project in the summer about upcoming material, It can lead to better leaning when the teacher actually has to teach the lesson or material. Therefore, when the student is then tested or quizzed on the topic after the lesson is taught, it will help to result in better grades because they were already given a preview of the material. Students learn better when they are not rushed through a topic, so when they are given the material through a summer project assigned by the teacher, it will result in better grades.

Teachers play a major role in students lives. When a student is struggling with a topic or something they are being taught, they automatically go to their teachers for help. Studies show that when students have one-on-one time with their teacher, it helps them to understand what they are learning. Therefore, when a student is assigned a project by a teacher, they can always count on them for help if they have questions or problems. When a student doesnt have the help they need from a teacher, they tend to just give up and not even try. This results in bad grades because they didn't have the help they needed when assigned something. When a student is confused about something, teachers are the first person they go to, so having a teacher assigned project is helpful when a student finds them self stuck.

Many students dont do well with turning papers in on time and completing their work. Having a teacher to put a deadline on a project will force the student to complete their work on time. When a student isn't given a due date, they procrastinate and dont feel the need to get any of their work done. Teachers need to be strict with their due dates and hopefully that will push the student to want to work harder and get their work turned in on time. In today's world, students arent pushed hard enough to turn something in on time, or they are given many extra days to turn something in. This results in the student's feeling like they can turn in late work all the time and still get a good grade. Teachers need to be more strict about due dates and not take late work. Student assigned projects will lead to nothing being completed on time or turned in. Therefore, teachers should assign projects that will force students to turn papers in on time.

Students should be required to complete summer assignments, but being assigned a project by a teacher will result in projects actually being done and turned in. Summer is for students to have fun and have a break, but they can't forget about school and the material that comes with it. That's where teachers need to come in and give the students a little brain refresh. This won't be done though if students were to assign projects to them self. Having teacher assigned project's will prepare the students for future material, allow help to students when they are struggling, and force students to turn their papers in on time.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
054D758A0DD0,"Students do not always agree with teachers when it comes to projects. Some schools assign summer projects. These can either be designed by the teachers or the students. There are those who argue that teachers should be the ones to design the projects. Although some may disagree, it is easier to just allow the students to design the projects themselves.

Student made projects can be very beneficial to teachers. First off, teachers will be able to learn more about their students. If the project is something more personal it could reveal something the teacher did not know about the student. For example, doing a project on an inspirational person will give the teacher a better idea of the student's interests. Secondly, teachers will not always have the best ideas for projects. The result of this could be a project that is easy to grade but a hassle for the student making it. Imagine having to write a monologue, it is very easy to critic; however, it is both a difficult assignment to script, as well as present. Finally, an assignment another student created could inspire a future student to try new things and give them fresh ideas for their projects. Assignments such as these are often kept by teachers, if they are good enough to present to future students as an example of what they could do. An example showing a project through a flashy presentation program like Prezi could draw a student's attention away from a boring poster.

If students were allowed to design their own projects, they would have greater freedom when developing ideas for their projects.

For starters, students will be much more motivated to work on a topic that interests them. Someone who likes action and crime would not be drawn to a project on a book like

Pride and Prejudice.

Also, students will get to experiment with new methods of presentation for their projects. Someone who invested a great amount of time and effort into their project will not want to present their work in a dull manner. A poster will not do justice to a project someone invested a lot of their time into; however, the student could try new PowerPoints or even make a video with fellow students in order to up the presentation. Finally, projects produced by students will be of both higher quality and variety than a uniform teacher's project. If the students are willing to put time in and really work hard on their projects then no two projects will be the same. These projects will all have different: methods of presentation, key points, evidence for claims, and the main idea will vary as a whole as well making the possibilities as great as the imagination of the students.

Although some may disagree, it is easier to just allow students to design the projects themselves. This method will benefit both the students and the teachers. Teachers will learn more about their students and will not have to design the projects. Students will be more free to use the methods they wish when making the project and will have the option to do the project on a topic they feel is worth expressing themselves for. Even future students will benefit if the teachers choose to keep the projects as examples. There are those who argue that teachers should design projects; however, it is better to just leave it to the students. No student wants to work on, let alone present a project which they have no interest in, so they should be free to guide themselves in whatever way they see fit.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
1AD208F3F94A,"Summer projects should be student-designed because this is their time to relax. Students should not have to go through more school work during their time off. How would you feel if you get worked handed to you on your day off? Students should be able to design their projects because this is a students personal time, some students learn different from others, and students should be able to do a project that they enjoy.

To start off, this is a students personal time. Most students would not want to have work handed to them during the summer because they have been in school for ten months. Students should feel as if this is their time to relax and do whatever it is that they like. If they have to do a project, it should be something that they want to do instead of what the teacher wants them to do. For example, back in elementary school my teacher gave us a reading project to do over the break. It was a book that I hated and I thought, ""Who even likes to read, let alone over break."" I was so made that we have to do this project, but if it had been a book that i actually wanted to read, I would have been more likely to do the project.

Secondly, some students learn in different ways than others. Not every single person learns the same as the next. Everyone is either an auditory, a visual, or a hands-on learner. Many people could prefer something totally different from you, so a teacher just handing a student a project and telling them to do it, will not help them to learn. For instance, I am a visual and hands-on learner, but the person next to me could be an auditory learner.

Lastly, students should be able to do a project that they enjoy. If students are given a project that they do not want to do or are at least interested in, the chances of them doing it are low. They don't even want to have work over the break, but if they are given something that they are interested in, they will most likely do it.

Some will think agree with my claim, others will disagree. The ones that disagree will probably say that teachers should design the projects. They may say that the teacher knows what is best for their students and that if the students have some authority over their project, they will do or pick something that does nothing for their knowledge and education. They may also say that they need to learn that not everything can got their way in life and they have to deal with what is front of them. I say that we give students the opportunity to be students and live their life as teens as much as they possibly can before they jump right into the real world. I believe that students should design their projects, but the teachers should approve. Compromising is a key factor in this. If people want the students to not have so much control over a project for school, teachers should be more open minded and be able to at least give their students a choice of enjoyable projects for the students to work on over break. Even then, students still have some sort of choice of what they find pleasurable to work on over their free time and still end up getting a grade for the work that they have completed.

In conclusion, students should be able to design their project over the break because it is their personal time, some students learn different from others, and students should be able to do a project that they enjoy. Students are maturing as the days go by. If we don't give them some sort of authority as they grow up, they will not develop into adults that can handle the real world. Letting them have some sort of freedom or choice over what they want to do, will benefit them in the long run and not let them grow up so fast. Looking at this from a students point of view will give you an open mind about my position on this topic. Students should be able to feel a since of freedom when it comes tho their break and not feel stressed or pressured to do more school work during their time off.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
942BFAC1A722,"Summer projects should be student-designed.

Most students dislike doing summer projects because they think of it as a chore.

By giving them the freedom to design the project themselves, they can have fun and share their creativity.

Students will be able to learn in a different way when they design their own assignments.

This could make it easier for students to learn and remember materials taught to them in previous years.

This may be a great thing for teachers as well.

I believe they will be amazed by their students projects.

They will see how creative their students are.

This may also help them with ideas for future assignments.

These projects don't only help the students, they help the teachers learn more about each student.

However, there is a downside to student-designed projects.

Teachers may have difficulty grading the projects if they don't make the assignments themselves.

Teachers can also find it easier to make the assignments themselves and use it for all of their classes.

Students may get caught up in using their creativity and having fun, that they lose sight of the assignment's purpose.

Students may end up recieving a bad grade because of these issues.

In conclusion, students should be able to design their own summer projects.

This will help them learn in a different way and share their creativity.  ",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4

4BF07DAD296D,"Should students design their own summer projects? Can they design better projects than the teachers? While students may be aware of their own weaknesses and design projects to help themselves learn, students may often get stuck during certain parts of the project. These situations would become a disadvantage to the students due to their lack of prior knowledge about making projects to maximize learning. On the other hand, these situations would become advantages to students if teachers designed the project and were able to help the students to minimize time spent being stuck on certain parts of the project. Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have sufficient experience with students in order to select the conditions for the project that are needed to help students learn during the summer, they would have sufficient knowledge about the project in order to quickly respond to student questions during the summer, and they can communicate with students and provide feedback in order to help students take maximum advantage of the summer project to learn.

Teachers have experience with students that would help them set conditons for the projects that would be beneficial for students to learn during the summer. For example, if students were required to report on historical events as part of a summer project and the teachers were aware that the students did not have enough experience finding credible sources, teachers would be able to provide a set of credible sources, such as textbooks and websites, that the students could use for their project. In this situation, teachers would be able to eliminate the need for students to find credible sources and students would be able to spend more time learning about the historical event they were reporting about. Teachers should design summer projects for students because they have the experience with students in order to anticipate and remove tasks that are irrelevant or detrimental to the learning of the students.

Teachers will be able to quickly answer questions related to the summer project, so that students minimize the time they spend being stuck on a certain part of the project. For example, if students were required to experiment on plants as part of a summer project, students could ask teachers about making the hypothesis or about conditions which the experiment should follow in order to achieve ideal results. In this situation, because the teachers designed the project, they would be able to anticipate these questions and provide the appropriate answers in order for students to complete the project. Teachers should be responsible for designing summer projects for students because they would have a better understanding of the project, and they would be able to quickly provide appropriate answers to student questions.

Teachers will be able to communicate with students more efficiently and provide meaningful feedback in order to help students take maximum advantage of the learning time during summer break. For example, if students were required to write an essay about a major theme in Romeo and Juliet, by William Shakespeare, students could share their thesis statements with their teachers, and the teachers would be able to provide references to different part of the novel for students to improve their thesis statements. In this situation, communication between students and teachers will enable the students to learn more about the novel by incorparating more parts of the novel into their essays. Teachers should design summer projects because they would be able to communicate effectively with students and provide feedback that allows students to spend more time improving their projects.

It is necessary for teachers to design summer projects because set conditions that allow students to continue learning during the summer, they can provide better answers to student questions, and they can provide meaningful feedback to students. Teachers are crucial to the design of summer projects because of the skills and experience that they bring when designing projects to help students learn during the summer. Therefore, teachers should be required to design summer projects instead of students, which will improve student learning.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
A2BEFDE54FB6,"A number of schools across the United States require students to complete summer projects. These summer projects are to assure the school system that you are continuing to learn over summer break. I feel that this is a valid thing to require us to do, as students we forget about half of what we learned during the school year over the summer. We never think to revisit our old work while we are enjoying the summer sun. Students tackle so much during a school year, homework, test, and projects; we deserve to choose our own way of learning during the summer, we would be much comfortable doing something we find fun and interesting.

Every grade school student can not wait to get through the year; the words ""summer"" are in the back of our heads and we just can't wait for it to get here. We get a huge break from school, no homework, no test, and no teachers, but yet you still have that one project you are required to do over break. I personally feel that we, as students, should be able to choose what to do for a summer project. Its our break so why not? School can be very stressful, especially as you get to high school. You are faced with tons of work and projects during the school year that teachers give you, for classes you are required to take. For once, Teenagers and other grade school students should be able to choose something they enjoy learning about.

Teachers don't know what interest us, what our favorite subject is, or the time we have over break to complete things like this. I feel teachers should write up guidelines or specific requirements for our project. Then, let us students find something educational over the summer to create a project about. By doing this we still get a say so in how our summer goes, but the teacher still approves of the project and makes sure its helping us learn. How could you manage to have fun when you have a huge project about history, that you have no interest in. Would I do it? No, I would be to wrapped up in summer to even think about the uninteresting project my teacher assigned me.

Students deserve to choose something that they enjoy learning about; we would most likely do it then. All students would have different projects and could teach others through what they learned over the summer. We go to school 8-9 months out of the year, and we are constantly told what to do, and how to do it whether we like it or not. Imagine picking out something you love, maybe you love the sun and learning about the weather. Perfect, you could do a project about summer and how the seasons change. Maybe you love animals and you are going to the National Zoo this summer; you could easily write an essay about your experience and facts you learned while visiting. Students find ways to make things fun, and sometimes teachers take that away from us, not meaning too it is just their job.

In conclusion, students need to have a stand on how their summer goes, considering it is our summer break. We should be able to find the fun in summer and somehow make an educational experience out of it, without an adult telling us exactly what to do. It's time to enjoy summer without the stress of a teachers assignment. Our brains discard a lot of information over the summer, but with a student picked summer project we would be able to keep our knowledge in a fun way that still meets the standards of the project.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
DE34EBAA18EE,"Imagine you wake up one day and its the last day of school, you then realize school is not over just yet and you have to still complete a summer project so that your learning continues. Think about does your school require for you to do a summer project. Some schools require students to complete summer projects, most students think it's a bad idea but some think it's a great thing to do during their summer break, but what if the students can design the project theirselves? My opinion is that students should be able to design their own summer projects on their own because it would help students stay out of trouble and doing teamwork is always good.

To begin with, summer projects can be a positive thing because it helps students stay out of trouble. Having to complete a summer project is the best things schools can require because when the students is on summer break for a long period of time they tend to do bad things such as: drugs, alcohol, fighting, and much more. Even though students is on break and dont have to attend school for awhile staff members still care for their students. Having the kids do their own project and design it however they would like can make their imagination be wild and creative and have the students to really think of what to do for their project. Parents would also agree on the summer projects so that their kids would not be bored and would not be into any trouble. Having kids to do summer projects is a great thing to come up with beacuse they would be out of trouble and focus on completing their project.

In addition, working as a team can also be good thing to do because the kids can meet new people. For example, say if the staff members put you in groups that doesn't have anyone that you know in them. Coming together and planning your project out with other kids can build a bond that you never knew would happen a day in your life. You might have someone who has the same idea as you for example like people always say, ""Great minds think alike."" Having someone in your group that think like you is a great thing because yall can already see your project being creative. As a team, working together is like working with other people when you have a job in the future, its preparing you to be able to work in a enviroment with other humans.

On the other hand, having the teachers design the projects would be a better organization beacuse they can lay out the requirements of the project. Even though the kids would'nt think the project would be fun the teachers would think otherwise. The students are more creative than the teachers, but the teachers are more organized than the students. The teachers can lay out the requirements and what they would want to see in the kids projects, but the students would think thats boring and not interesting. Even though, the teachers can do a better organization and lay of the project, the students would think that it would not be interesting enough. Having the students design their projects would be great!

As you can see, I think the students should be able to design their own summer project because it would help students stay out of trouble and doing teamwork is always good. Having the students design their own project would be a good benefit to them and the people around them. Doing a summer project is the best thing schools can ever come up with, because students can still learn things even when they are on summer break. The projects can be a very exciting thing to do and its also keeping the kids busy!     ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
A29794857B1E,"Summer is that time of year when people really show their trueselves. My mom once said, ""How do you live a life that's meant to be yours; when people are controlling your life for you?"" Summer projects are best completed when they are student-designed because there is more creativity, productivity, and freedom. Without any of that there is no reason behind the source of a project; which is you.

Student-designed projects are full of creativity because it comes directly from the students' mind. It shows there personality through the art of the subject. If you were to give a student a summer project with step to step directions they would overthink it. Summer means freedom, so why would a student want to be reminded they have to go back to prison in less than three months with a teacher-designed project? Whereas, if you give them more freedom they use what they already know without freaking out. In braingames, a scientific show, it shows that when you are given a task with a specific wanted outcome your brain tends to overthink it. Creativity comes from ones self, and if you have a teacher-designed project, the results will all look the same.

When there is productivity there is results. A student can be overloaded with school work and say they are busy, but does that mean they get anything done? Currently I am in three after school clubs, one honor society, and an executive for one of the biggest events that happen yearly at Generic_School. I've been productive because all the organizations are student-runned, which leads to more kids wanting to participate. However, if the organizations were all ran by teachers then you would have five to zero students showing up. When something is student ran the project becomes more important because they are able to do it their way with fewer limitations. Productivity is an important factor for student-designed projects because your end-results become more clear.

Generic_Name once said, ""It's okay to start over."" Generic_Name meant that student's should have the oppurtunity to something new like student-designed projects. There is so much more enjoyment in a project when it's on the student's terms and not a teacher's. Last year I was assigned a five page, back to front english project that had numerous restrictions and specific instructions. Only two of the twenty nine students in my class turned it in completed. If the teacher had redesigned the project to make it more for the student and not his own enjoyment, the number wouldv'e been higher , and there wouldn't have been a price on our freedom.

Student-designed projects are more beneficial to not only the student's but the teacher as well. The creativity of a student-dsaigned project gives you a better variety of projects because what teacher wants to look at the same project over and over? There is more freedom because the student is not chained to restrictions, and it's more productive when it's on their terms. It helps them to not only to assure learning, but show who they are and what they can do.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
F777F214BD6D,"Do you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing on an assignment or don't know where to start and you have nobody to help you?

Teachers should not allow students to design their own projects over the summer because if a student designs the project they would not know what to do and be unorganized, it's more efficient for the teacher to assign and grade, and finally teachers can assign you topics you have already went over in class. However, some may not agree on this position. Some points to take in consideration are that not all students will like the topic and may not know a lot on that specific that's assigned.

Firstly, when starting a new project students may not know what to do. For example, in my Vietnamese class I was assigned a project that was on Vietnam's geography. I was very confused on it because we had to do it on our own without any help or an outline. I didn't know where to start, where to find the information, or how choose a suitable location.

In addition, it is more efficient for the teacher to assign and grade. For instance, if your teacher gave you the opportunity to do your own project it would be very difficult to organize. The teach would have to create individual rubrics because every student will most likely have a different type of project. It would also be hard for the teacher because the teacher has to deal with a variety of different topics.

Consider this as an example, teachers can assign you with topics they went over in class. An example of this would be if a teacher assigned you a project based on a topic that you've already went over it would be a lot easier for you to accomplish and understand.

In conclusion, it is better for teachers to design projects for students because if a student designs a project they would not know what to do, it is more efficient for teachers to assign and grade, and finally teachers can assign project that you've already went over in class. Students should prefer teacher-designed based projects because it's less work for them and the teacher.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
F8C22ACD1774,"Swimming in the ocean, getting a tan, boating, and fishing are all exciting activities for the summer; in contrast, a school project is not, especially one without clear instructions.

A school project that is completely student-designed is unfathomable for many Elementary, Middle, or High School students because of the stress it would create during a time of recovery.

Many teachers give summer assignments, but allow for students to do the work, that was required to be completed over the summer, during the school year.

Although projects with specific instructions by the teacher can be tedious, many could argue that coming up with a rubric for ones self would be of greater difficulty.

In the event that schools make summer projects mandatory, it is the responsibility of teachers to make sure students learn necessary information and achieve the goals of the project.

Teachers should design the summer project for students because no teacher wants to grade abstract projects and no student wants to strive for individuality when out of contact with classmates, for when students are on summer break many do not have the ability so see if they are doing the same project, accidentally, as others.

A psychology teacher conducts a final exam each year in the form of a project in which students choose a topic and are not given instructions besides to relate it to psychology; consequently, she has found this project to be a hassle more than an excitement for both her and some of her students.

The process of completing a project goes smoother when given rules to follow and, within those rules, allowing students to express themselves even more than that of a guideline-free project.

For anyone to learn about a topic through the creation of a project, there must be guidelines in order to research and learn the information needed for the class in which the project is for.

Clear instructions provide students with the information required to obtain a passing score and to also give information needed to pass classes of the next school year.

When completing homework or classwork in which students must research to learn what the next unit will entail allows students a chance to learn more than what is required and provides students the ability to learn even before the information is taught.

Many students would jump at the opportunity to get ahead on the information for the next school year and many may not enjoy the requirement, but appreciate the opportunity.

Giving clear instructions provides the structure to learn and get ahead before the race for grades begins.

A summer project in which the students are designing and planning does not insure they will continue to learn during their break, but instead assures teachers that students will attempt to make it as non complex and superficial for themselves as possible.

Providing students with the opportunity to design their project uniquely with no specifications needed enables them to be lazy in the creation of the project and miss critical information for the subject that the project is on.

Students come up with many ways to avoid in depth descriptions of a topic because of the lack of motivation to do so.

With clear instructions, students will be able to find the information the teacher wants and needs in order to grade the project, and the information needed to elaborate on this knowledge in the beginning of the school year.

Students want the ability to enjoy the summer and with the specific necessities for the summer project highlighted, they will not have the stress of creating a project from scratch.

Many people have found student-designed projects to be more time consuming, although less tedious, and will overall take away from the main purpose of summer vacation which is to recover from the stress induced during the school year.

It takes time to plan a student-designed project and many are not given the time needed because of family vacations and summer jobs to account for.

Summer assignments are difficult to complete no matter the type, but an all-encompassing, nonspecific project would be found a stressor many would not wish to endure.

To conclude, summer is a time for rejuvenation and recuperation; therefore, requiring an abstract project during this time is inadequate to the idea that many students are unable to complete such a task based on prior engagements, no structural support to aid in finding information needed, and upholding the sole purpose of summer.

Students do not want the stress of the school year carried over into the summer and neither do teachers, for students may find the need to contact teachers about what they can and cannot do if there is not a rubric they are able to follow.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
FA4D3E89245D,"The main event that everyone that is in school tends to look forward to during the year is summer break. For most schools, depending on the curriculum, you dont have any work or projects assigned for the their upcoming year. However, some schools or teachers in schools, assign their rising students projects or assignments for their upcoming year. In order to prepare you for next year, the recommended tactic to assign these projects is by the teachers simply because they can give them all the tools and resources necessary in order to complete the specific assignment, they know what students will be learning their next year or what their next grade teacher wants to see in their project, therefore, the school or teachers would assign a project thats beneficial for next year, And the teachers can help you with coming up with different methods to approach the assignment.

Knowing what you are gonna be using for the project is always important because with ought it you would probably make completing the project harder than it should be. But the teachers can give u something like a website or a certain book that you need for it. For example, say u had a simple project in math class for geometry. They would tell u that you need a compass protractor for the project so that your answers are accurate. Another would be them giving you a website to help solve the problems such as Desmos(A website used as a tool for solving math problems). Simple things like this helps you with the project a lot more, not to mention, its coming from the teachers so you dont have to give yourself a headache trying to find out what to use for the project. That part will already be taken care of. Some teachers will even go out there way to print out a paper for u or posting it for u to look back at it.

With further reasoning, the projects assigned to you are going to be for your next upcoming class from that teacher most likely. The teacher knows what you all will be learning in the future class, so, it only makes sense if the teacher gave you a project based on what you will be learning next year. For instance, say you are about to take world history next year. The teacher could assign you a project that could be such as, ""What do you already know about early history"" or a scavenger hunt learning about the early life of our world because that is how that class starts off. If the project didnt really have any way of benefiting you other than just a grade in the class, then it wouldnt really be as good to you in the long run. This is why teachers should assign the projects because you can look back at the project for key information to help through out the unit.

The final reason is that teachers help you with approaching the assignment in different ways to complete it. Honestly, it seems that some assignments just cant be done with ought the help of your teacher. This what teachers are for. The reason why the assignment should be assigned by the teacher is because they can give you many ideas or ways to figure out what you want to do. The summer reading project is something that you have to do every year for English class for next years first grade. The way that teachers really help is that they will give you a specific list of books in my different genres that will be best for you to write an essay or any other project on that book. They make it nice and organized as well for you to read it clearly and search a certain genre easier. Not to mention that you can use a public library or the school library to get the book you need and you can get rolling. Its really helpful that the teachers give students a reference because with ought it, most students would not even know what they want to read over the summer or they can just simply forget about it.

In conclusion, it is more beneficial for the students to have their summer assignments assigned by the teachers because they can really help the students find what they have to use for the project so that they know what they need to use for the project. They help students by giving them ideas for the project to make them more successful on their assignment as well. And finally they can make the project useful for you to look back on as a reference for the next class you will be taking.                               ",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
7ABE9F1D3F99,"Schools should let their students design what summer project they want to do. Summer projects should be designed by students because they can show how creative they are and it should be on what they want it to be based off.

To begin, students should have the ability to show their creativity. For example, it was heading towards the end of my freshman year, and my teacher informed us that we were going to have a project over the summer. She then stated that it must be full with creativity in your own way. I decided I wanted to make a project that defines my life. I want it to have meaning, sense of humor, and of course creativity. It was then Saturday May 18,1991 I woke up from rest and with no hesitation I started my project. My life was a roller coaster just heading all the way up to success but only to go down with nothing else left. It wasn't a wish where everything I desired would come to existence. It was just another day with demons that couldn't be faced, with tears full of depression, hope no where to be found, and just the sound of loneliness. I was a little boy, named Generic_Name, who had only himself to look up to. My parents were both killed by gunshots to the chest left on the sidewalk to just bleed out cries. I was left with my uncle at the age of 14 now in college at 22. I still to this day which I could go back in time just to let my parents know how much I love them. This proves, that all stories can be unique in the saddest ways.

Next, students should have the power to create a summer project they desire. For instance, my friend, Generic_Name, did a whole project on her favorite subject science. She created numerous experiments in the summer involving animals and chemicals. I remember seeing her in my house designing a robot in my living room who could be charged up by chemicals. Generic_Name was always a scientist with a ginormous brain that had all the answers. This shows, you can use what you love and turn it into a piece of art.

Some people think teachers should be the ones to design student projects. However, they are wrong because students deserve to have freedom of choice. In Kindergarten, we use to do projects of our choice and compete with another classmate to see who had the best project. I made a 3D paper plane that flew for a total of 45 seconds. My classmate, Generic_Name, made a rose using napkins. Next, my class had to vote between me and Generic_Name and I won by 3 votes.

In conclusion, summer projects should be made by students because they can show creativity and have the ability to choose what they desire. If you are ever in this situation always remember to go with what you know.",3,Summer projects,Independent,0.4
3A78FDB5DF52,"Schools should definitely require students to have some form of summer homework, so they are not completely brain-dead when they return the following year. The argument on whether or not it should be teacher or student designed is a tough one. Nevertheless, students' summer projects should be student-designed, because it makes it more fun, pushes students to be more creative, and is easier for students to complete.

Admittedly, some might claim that summer homework should be teacher-designed, because it provides more insightful, specific, instructions rather than each student doing their own thing. These claims are wrong, because if teachers want students to be more involved over summer, giving them the freedom to express themselves however they please is the best way to do so. Students would rather take the time to come up with their own projects than doing some old, outdated assignment like reading a specific book.

Firstly, summer projects should be student-designed because they are more fun on the students' behalf. Students would have the freedom to do whatever they want around a certain topic, giving them the means to complete it on their own time, their own way. For example, If the topic was about the book, "" To Kill A Mockingbird "" one could do a podcast, make a short film, write a review, make a pamphlet, or anything they want, regarding this topic. Students would be more dedicated to designing and completing their own work, start to finish.

Secondly, summer projects should be student-designed because it pushes students to be more creative. Students are tasked with coming up with one of many types of ideas for the project, versus just doing whatever the teacher assigns. Students must be creative about what kind of project they want to design, how they want to do it, and how it will be different from his or her classmates. Students could also be assigned to compete against one another, which will push them to do their very best work. Students could even use their forte , which is social media, to complete these projects.

Furthermore, summer projects should be student-designed because it is easier for students to complete. When projects are teacher-designed, especially over summer, they can be hard to do. These projects sometimes have minimal instructions, and since it is over summer, there is no teacher guidance, just a bland rubric. This is why summer projects should be student-designed. Students also have better ideas for their own projects, which is why they prefer designing their own over a teacher-assigned one. Students will complete their own projects faster, have more fun with them, and even be able to incorporate their friends and classmates however they please.

In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because it is more fun on the students behalf, promotes creativity, and makes it easier for students to complete. Schools must be more open to these ideas, and also to the fact that students deserve a say in what they do or what they are assigned to. Schools must promote student involvement more, giving them the freedom and room to express themselves, while in a safe environment. Teachers also need to trust their students with being able to design and complete their own projects, which will help mature them and shape them into the adults the future needs.                           ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
C01B298F4F3C,"Students abhor teachers telling them what to do. They would count of how many days left until break to come and rescue them from boredom. Individuals want to do something without others telling them what they should or have to do. Instead of doing homework and exams, they enjoy doing projects that excites them. Having the teacher assign a task for them over summer break would be a horrible idea. The students wouldn't listen to the teachers and having the students to design their own project would mean that they would use their creative, original thought.

It's not fun when teachers gives you an assignment to do over the weekend or break. My teachers would give all their students to work over the summer so it can prepare them for next year classes. They would either have us do a book report about what we read over the summer or hand us a packet to do math equations. This is not at all what I planned to do over the summer. Instead, I did what I want to do to have an unforgettable summer.

The teachers giving us an opportunity to think about what project we should do over the summer would change the students point of views. My physics teacher wanted his students to do a project that has anything to do with physics. It made me wonder what I should do to make this work more enjoyable and exciting to do. While I was thinking, my cat fell off the counter and landed on her feet. This made me do my research and I learned interesting articles explaining that. I wanted it to test it out myself to see if its actually true. This made a huge difference of how I see everything in our world today. There's so much more to discover than sitting in your desk and doing a worksheet.

Students couldn't do a project that relates to school. The teachers teaching and giving them work would help them focus in life. It prepares them for what they need to overcome the obstacles. Giving the students to work over the summer would help to excel for their future classes and not fall behind other students. Furthermore, They will have the knowledge to help them in their difficult life and get through their struggles.

Letting the students to come up with their own project would have them use their creative, original ideas. This would broaden their horizons of how they see their own world. They can discover new things and would make them to keep learning. They can tell everyone about the stuff they find out and would make themselves feel good. This would leave an impact for those children. This is a huge step for students to move forward and succeed in life.",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
17050101B707,"Throughout the school year, students face many challenging tasks designed by teachers; with most of which are very stressful and time consuming. Some schools even go as far as to require the students to complete summer projects. Although these projects are usually informative, they are typically excessive and tedious. The summer is a time when students want to relax and be relieved from the stress they have acquired during the school year; therefore, students should be able to design their own summer projects. This will, not only, be less stressful, but it will allow students to express their creativity and be more productive.

As a student myself, I know how stressful the work can be. Just last week I had to complete three powerpoint presentations and write a three page essay. The work tends to become very taxing on my physical and mental health. During the entire week I barely got enough sleep, and I felt as if I did not give my full effort. Many people will argue that this amount of work will prepare you for your following school years. In that, there is truth; however, it has been proven that when people take breaks from intensive tasks they come back even stronger and better prepared. During the summer, no one wants to endure anymore school related stress than they have to, and that is why students should be able to decide on their own summer projects. If they are given the opportunity to choose what they would like to work on during the summer, they would definitely be more efficient in what they do and less stressed.

Second, allowing students to design their own projects will not only result in less stress, but will allow them to express their creativity. Some believe that if the students were to choose their own projects then they would be too easy and not require much critical thinking; thus, defeating its purpose of ensuring that students continue to learn over the break. This is a valid possibility given the fact that they are in control of what they choose to do; however the projects that teachers assign are usually all the same. Resulting in every student working on the exact same thing. This method also risks the same possiblity. Many students will not actually complete the assignment, but instead copy the work of another classmate. I, myself, have seen this be done on several ocassions and have even done it as well. If students are given the opportunity to decide on their own projects, they will be forced to complete the task individually, eliminating the possibility of cheating while also allowing them to show off their skills.

Third, when given a tedious task to complete, most students tend to procrastinate. I, myself, and many others do as well. Students enjoy working on projects that are interesting and that can relate to them. Most of the time, the projects that are assigned by schools are striclty informational and present them no interest. If the schools would allow students to choose their own project to complete, it would encourage them to complete it in a timely manner, which would overall increase their productivity.

In conclusion, some schools require that students complete a summer project to assure that they continue learning during the break. The summer is a time when students should receive a break from the intense work given by teachers; therefore, students should be able to design their own summer projects. This will, not only, result in less stress, but it will allow students to express their creativity and increase their productivity.",5,Summer projects,Independent,0.8
3925EB5265DF,"Students are brought immense joy with the thought of summer. When the thought of summer projects arrive however, they feel extremely stressed. Although some may think this stressful feeling may be alleviated if the students designed their own summer projects, teachers prevent more stress by creating these projects themselves. Teachers should be the designers of summer projects, ensuring that students retain large amounts of vital knowledge during the summer and have a smooth, organized transition back into school.

If teachers customized these projects, it would become more organized, making things lighter on the instructor when grading them. Teachers are the ones responsible for grading every individual project. With their own policies for a project, they can grade over those policies with ease. This ensures the most smooth and organized grading of the project, deterring struggle for the teachers and students. Assignments are easier to grade when there is a strict, self-made outline created for them. If they are the creators of the project, teachers can easily evaluate how to grade each project. Some may think that students can create great outlines that are easy to grade upon; however, teachers can create a better outline considering that they are the graders themselves. With the ability of creating policies in the most organized way, teachers can grade these assignments with maximum ease, preventing stress on both sides.

Teachers are heavily educated on the content students must know. They are made to teach, due to their immense amount of personal knowledge. This personal knowledge teachers contain can be used to assist students greatly with schoolwork of a specific topic. Teachers should create the structure of these projects because they can provide students with important knowledge in the subject .

Although some may believe that students have the ability to support themselves with the use of the internet, teachers are a more reliable source for assistance, seeing that many websites contain unreliable facts. The school system tells teachers the specific topics students must have remembrance of. With the idea of the subjects students must remember, teachers can assist them in retaining the knowledge that is found to be the most necessary for them. If teachers design these projects, it will ensure that students will have the vital knowledge and assistance needed to have a smooth transition back into school.

Teachers can instruct better when they create the assignment given. Instructors teach their students based on the summer assignment given. Creating the project themselves would help the teacher instruct the students on a specific, self-created basis. Instruction would become easier to do for the teacher and the student would not be confused, due to working upon the same basis. Although some may think that students have the capability of creating such a basis, teachers are more experienced in doing that, as it is a part of their job. If instructors make the students' summer assignments, then teaching and learning would become easier.

With the many benefits it would provide for each student and instructor, teachers should be the ones to create the structure of the students' summer projects. With their creation, students will retain the most important knowledge. Students will be stripped form unnecessary distress as well as teachers. Having instructors create summer assignments is a better idea than having students do so.      ",4,Summer projects,Independent,0.6
