Using a phone while driving can cause very bad wrecks, because they are putting themselves and other people at risk.

First of all, wrecks can be caused by looking down at your phone while driving. Most importantly, you should always keep your eyes directly on the road when behind the wheel of a car. On that note, you will have an outrageously car payment just because you were looking down at your phone. Moreover, if you the reason the accident happened the person that was operating the other car can sue you for lots of money, and you will have to pay it. Therefore, if you don't pay whatever the person charges you consequences will be served and that's behind bars.

Another reason why we should not be able to use cell phones while operating an automobile is that you are putting other people's lives in danger. Thus, looking down at your cell phone you can get someone else hurt for the uncommunicative act you committed. As well as unconsciousness, injuries, or being in a hospital.

Today, most of the society is thoughtless. Especially new drivers, all driver for that matter do not understand the dangers of looking at a cell phone while behind the wheel.

The automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing, teens have been the largest age group that was reported to being distracted by cellular usage. I do not agree with people using their cell phones and driving, humans should be smarter to know that if something is going on while they are driving that is so important then pulling off to the side of the road. The society doesn't understand that teens are the main cause for accidents I mean, in two thousand and five there was three hundred and one thousand injuries that were caused in distracted driving related accidents, that doesn't necessarily mean that the driver was texting or using a cellular device. New drivers do not understand that deaths are usually results of an accident. one out of every four car accidents is caused by texting and driving.   ",2,Phones and driving,Independent,0.2

Drivers should not be able to use phones while operating a vehicle. Drivers who used their phone while operating a vehicle are most likely to get into an accident that could be fatal.

According to an article by the Edgar Snyder Firm, 21% of teens that were part of a fatal car accident was due to phones. According to the same article, 35% know the risk but continue using their phones while on the road. This shows that its beyond dangerous and irresponsible of drivers not to be fully aware of their surroundings while driving. Drivers should be able to concentrate without any distractions, because it could be fatal.

According to another article, ""Distracted Driving"" by the NHTSA, there has already been about 3,000 phone related car accident deaths since 2017. The article states that teen get too distracted with their phones, which causes their accident. Accidents that can be easily avoided by focusing on the road and not a phone.

The ability to stay connected to people we know despite distance was originally brought to fruition by the use of letters. This system was found to be rather slow and new pathways were searched for until the invention of the telegram; the people thought it was an invention of the millennia, but after time it too was thought of as slow until the invention of the telephone. Today, a telephone is in the hand or pocket of a majority of the seven billion people on planet earth. However, this device is taken to areas that it is irresponsible and dangerous.

Within a vehicle capable of traveling upwards of one hundred miles per hour any possible distraction can become fatal spontaneously. The most common of these distractions is a cell phone, with its capabilities to connect us to anyone also in ownership of one, it is easy to pick it up whenever it sounds. In that split second of reaching over for a phone, eyes no longer on the road, it is impossible to no an exact location of anything, making an extremely dangerous action. For the myriad of possibilities that lead to serious injury cell phones should stay in the current state they are in regards of the law, but taken as a more serious offense.

Conversely people may believe that laws in present need to change, becoming less restrictive. People have the right to communicate with whom they wish, when or wherever they may choose to do so. The problem becomes apparent that this is a selfish process of thought; people aren't thinking of those they share the road with. Laws currently in place are not to punish people making poor choices, they are an attempt to keep people safe.

The creation of telecommunication devices was to keep connected to others without regard to the obsession that would encompass the human mind that was bound to follow. The safety of people is top priority without exemption.      ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6
97C1CFD04E4B,"Cell phone use should not be legal while driving, it causes many accidents even fatalities. Drivers become careless while driving when using cell phones. Cell phones cause distractions while on the road. Drivers do not pay attention to the road, which causes accidents to happen. The most prevalent distractions are texting and talking on a cell phone while driving. Cell Phone use should not be legal while driving because it will help prevent more accidents and also prevent more deaths. People become distracted while driving when they use cell phones and bring danger into life, the government should regulate stricter laws to citizens about cell phone use on the road.

Drivers are too busy talking on cell phones and not paying attention to the road. Even the act of just dialing a cell phone can be dangerous. This increases the crash risk by 3 times. This is one of the worst distractions drivers can have, due to the fact that you are not paying attention to the road. Maybe the driver gets a call, gets into an argument, or they are driving too slow. Also another reason is calling while driving can also block out hearing cause the driver is too focused on who is talking, also the driver is less aware of cars around.

This has a big impact on the economy and death rates in the world.

The next reason cell phone use should be illegal while driving is due to texting. This causes the same risks but at a higher rate because you are constantly looking at your phone. Drivers are too busy focused on their screen to pay attention to the road. They are also too busy thinking about their responses and what to say to pay attention to other drivers on the road. Since it usually takes two hands to text, the driver has no hands on the steering wheel. This distraction causes the most fatalities.

This is just another reason cell phone use while driving should be illegal. Drivers however, underestimate their risks of getting into an accident while using their cell phone on the road. Companies also have this break with reality. They promote things like hand free devices, even though those have been shown not to eliminate the risk of getting into an accident. ""Device makers and auto companies acknowledge the risks of multitasking behind the wheel, but they aggressively develop and market gadgets that cause distractions.

Overall, they acknowledge these things happen but they still market things that will cause distractions and increase accident risk.

State governments should set stricter rules about cell phone use while driving. Death rates are going up rapidly everyday. More and more people are passing away from others not paying attention to their pathway. People are being less cautious and lose focus while being on the road. People should care about their lives and others around them more and should put their phones down until reaching the destination.    ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Driving is a good way to get whatever you need to go in a shorter period of time than on foot. Americans like driving from places such as fast food restaurants to appointments or work. As technology advances and people like to accommodate themselves with technology, we also want this same technology with us even in our vehicles. However if someone is driving with a device I think it is dangerous and can cause serious injuries. Drivers should not be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle because it can be a distraction to not only you but others, can cause a car accident, and it can be illegal . If you are not convinced then I'll explain why driving while on your phone is dangerous.

While driving anywhere you need to always focus on who and what is in your nearby surroundings. In fact, according to driving test.org, ¨ texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving under the influence of alcohol¨ . Since the light refracted off the phone is what you are focused on, vehicles or objects approaching would not get your attention. This is especially true when the phone emits a light with a brighter color or image.

Also best case scenario if you do not cause an accident you may even miss your turn or exit all because you were distracted. Worst case scenario you may cause an accident which I will explain next.

Driving while you are on your phone is not only dangerous because it can be distracting but what happens can lead to a car accident. If you do not take the time to focus on the road, your carelessness may harm pedestrians or other drivers. DrivingTest.org says twenty Texting and Driving makes you 23% more likely to be involved in an accident¨ . It then goes on to say that in 2011, 1.3 million automobiles accidents were caused by this and one can only assume that the numbers have gotten higher with technology advancing. A later text mentions that in 2015

¨3,477 people were killed and 391,000 injured¨ in crashes relating to texting while driving. This can even be illegal are result in murder.

Driving while on your phone can be illegal .If my other two arguments have not you proven that on the phone while driving then hopefully this argument will. Driving while holding your phone is illegal in my state of residence of Georgia. It is illegal under ¨the part of a sweeping hands-free law¨ according to www.usatoday.com `Even though driving with your phone may not be illgeal in your state as stated above it can possibly result in murder. ¨Texting while driving can lead to a homicide charge ¨says pittsburgcriminalattorney.com. The site says you get charged with this if you happen to cause the death of a person due to ¨recklessness¨ or ¨gross negligence¨.

Therefore due to your recklessness of not putting away your phone while behind wheels you can face heavy charges when it could have been prevented.

In conclusion driving with a phone present is a sure way to distract someone and possibly an accident. If that is not convincing then the accident can lead to the death of passengers or other drivers. This will result in heavy charges if deemed responsible for death. Therefore save everyone the trouble by simply putting your device away until you reach your destination or parking real quick. Concluding my argument why drivers should not be able to use a cellphone in any capacity is supported by not my words but professionals as well.   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

In this world in which we live in, cell phones are a growing market as well as cars. The fact that we depend on cell phones throught the course of our day for numerous reasons.

Drivers should be able to use their cell phones while driving because its easier to operate a phone in your hand than a cell phone that is not in your hand. Emergencies can occur while driving and you need to report the emergerncy while driving. Cell phones does not cause as big of a distracHon that other things that is done while driving.

A lot of people are in an uproar about driving and using a cell phone and someHmes it is overrated. Trying to operate a cell phone with one hand while maintaining driving has no danger to it. A phone that is mounted on the holder that begins to ring is harder to operate answering, dialing and switching calls.

Most Hmes the mounHng is not secure or has defected parts which can cause more of an issue than having it to your ear. Most people have older cars and cannot a? ord to upgrade and dont have the speaker opHon, which usually allows everyone surrounding your car to know you business.

I cannot say it enough, emergencies happen in a ?ash. Driving and you see a accident that needs emergency aLenHon you need to be able to use the cell phone to call it in. Things happen so quickly now and it could be your phone call that saves their life. Also if a person is lost and no gps signal but calls can be made a person should be able to dial someone by hand and get direcHons out of harms way. Emergency is a big deal in cell phone usage.

Cell phones do not cause as much as a distracHon than people make out to be. As a driver a person should always be aware of the road and be able to mulH-task when using a cell phone. Most Hmes its other things besides a cell phone that cause a distracHon but blames the cell phone as a scapegoat. There could be test on the driver liscence test that we should take to see if were able to drive and talk on the phone instead of just banning it.

Talking on a cell phone and driving a car may be a distracHon for some but not all. It should be our call on if we are focused enough to drive while talking. Although some people are said to have had bad behavior while talking and driving some are very responsible. TexHng and driving is di? erent from talking and driving and that should be the boundary.

Drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones when driving because they can be severely injured or worse die. The number of crashes related to a phone and texting have made the use of a phone while driving illegal. Also the non use of a cell phone behind the wheel saves countless lives everyday.

Some states have also enacted laws to ban cell phone use. In the United States risk of automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than if they weren't on their phone.

Driving with a cell phone has been the main cause of vehicle crashes over the last decade. Which led to most states banning the use of the device completely. However One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting and driving. Strong evidence that both retrieving and, in particular, sending text messages has a detrimental effect on that individual that increases their urge to use it.

2E0A63554A2C,"Should drivers be able to be on their phone while driving? My opinion to that question would be no for many reasons. You shouldn't have any distractions while driving. Way too many people are killed in car accidents and there doesn't need to be any other distractions while driving. Driving while using a cell phone is a vision distraction, it's law enforced, and it's a hazard to other drivers.

Any form of usage on a cell phone while being in the car is dangerous in many ways. Drivers need to sit back and think is texting or calling anyone at this very second worth a risk of taking or endangering not only my own life but risking it for any one else's.

Using a phone not only causes danger, but causes many forms of distraction and disorder. It can be physically danger in and kind of situation, it is mentally distracting depending on what the cause is, and can even become an issue not only with the protection of human but a problem with the law. Doing anything on the phone in that very moment is not worth taking anyone, yet their own life's but yet not worth getting into trouble that could've been avoided.

It's safer to have someone in the car with you, talking to you rather than you being on your phone. The passenger in the car can keep you company and keep you entertained. A cell phone will distract you and you could take your life and even someone else. Being on your phone could make you drive slower and cause other vehicles to pass you and that could cause an accident.

Drivers should not have in their possession at any time a cell phone. It's too much of a risk. There is no need for a snapchat or a game can't wait in order to not take you own life or someone else's. There is enough distractions while driving without it being a phone.

I believe that drivers shouldn't use cell phones while driving because it is an attention hazzard. Driving with your phone in hand is not only illegal but very dangerous, but driving without the distraction of a phone can lower the driving fatality rates by a lot. Also, there are apps and programs on the phones that help drivers go hands free. Last, having that phone as a distraction while driving can cause a significant lowering of you reaction time and attention to the people, objects, and other cars on the road.

First and foremost, Driving without the phone as a distraction will generally lower the fatality rates of distracted driving accidents. Not only will it save you life and everyone else in the vehicle but also you will avoid needless deaths just because you couldn't put the phone down. The lack of self-control is the reason why people get distracted by their phones, especially the younger generation of drivers which leads to possibly fatal driving accidents.

Furthermore, Driving while distracted can significantly slow down your reactions to people, objects, and other cars on the road, with that you would be more likely to hit pot holes and debris on the road and a higher chance of causing an accident. Also, looking for pedestrians crossing while distracted just makes driving harder than it has to be.

Finally, There are various things that have been put in place to keep the driver from getting distracted by their phones, For example apps and programs on the phones that keep the driver from checking or responding to their phones. It prevents the driver from getting phone calls, texts, and other notifications while in the car. Another example, the hands-free laws that hold the people that like to drive with phone in hand accountable. Last is personal accountability, keeping yourself in check and safe but not just yourself but the people in the car with you and the other cars.

In conclusion, Drivers shouldn't drive while using a phone because if more people don't drive with their phones the likelihood of them getting into a possibly fatal accident decrease by a lot, there are also ways that you phone can keep itself from being a distraction like the apps and programs on it that block phone calls and texts, but more importantly the driver personally keeping themselves accountable for their actions on the road, and the fact that the more the driver is distracted the slower their reaction time is so they won't be able to pay closer attention to the people, objects, and other cars on the road.

We use cell phones for anything now such as: texting, social media, calls, schedule planning, etc. Unfortunately, we are choosing to use them at the wrong time and wrong place, while we are driving. As time is going by, we are getting more and more into the phones that we don't care about our personal safety or others safety. Using cellphones while driving can be extremely dangerous to the drivers and others around them for many reasons.

When we are driving it can be exceedingly difficult to focus on the surroundings around us and easy to forget that you are sharing the road with other people and not just yourself. Other drivers take notice when drivers are on their phones whether they want to or not because of the danger they can cause. Erratic driving is something that we all get worked up about because it can make us late or can be inconvenient to us. Drivers also tailgate you because they can't keep the constant speed because they are on their phones. Sometimes pedestrians are killed because people are on their phones and don't pay attention to their surroundings. We may not intend to end someone's life, but we made the poor decision to drive and text so now we must live with that for the rest of our life.

Everyday people die in car accidents because we use cell phones while driving. According to my research the number one leading car accidents are distracted drivers. Research shows that being on your phone while driving can cause the risk 4x more of a horrible crash. Because we use cell phones more often now, we use our phones knowing the danger it could cause because we want to keep in touch with people. They also think that the hand-free is a safe thing to use because they are driving with two hands instead of holding the phone.

Driving with cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents that they cause, it causes someone's insurance to rise, and it causes concerns to people's health. I think people are more concerned with their conversation than with their own safety and the safety of others. Research has proven that people who use cell phones while driving are more prone to be/cause an accident. People who use cell phones while driving does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. It also can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that could lead to tragedy.

In conclusion, people should stop texting and driving because it can cause serious damage. Not only that it can take someone's life. Texting while driving is a serious problem today because we are on our phones 24/7 and we don't usually put it down. We are distracted by our phones to the point where we shouldn't be able to drive with a phone in the car because of how long we are on our phones.

Many people who are caught up in these types of situations do it to themselves by using their phones, causing accidents and injury that shouldn't have happened. This needs to stop, maybe even be helped if it can't be stopped.

Many people get upset when new rules coming out trying to limit phone use while driving. This shouldn't be the case though as they are just trying to prevent any unnecessary injury. This could also mean time in jail for the driver for being on his or her phone in the first place. This again causes unnecessary problems that could be avoided. The person who was using their phone would also have to pay a fee for the damages to the vehicle or even the person.

Another reason people shouldn't be able to use cell phones all the time is because there's always a time where and ambulance is driving by or even a cop. Most people would pull to the side. On the other hand, if your blasting and unaware of your surrounding because your using your phone you wouldn't be able to hear them unless they were right next to you. This could cause injury to whoever they were rushing to get to. If it was a cop It would be bad for the driver blasting music too. Not being able to use the phone keeps you safer and out of trouble.

A way to make it somewhat safe for phone use however is to have a Bluetooth connection in the car. This is a pretty good compromise. People can just use their car to control phone needs. All calls can be answered and texts can be read without looking at a phone. This will keep the person safe and make looking at the phone less of a problem. This however wouldn't stop all problems which is why I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones in capacity while driving.

In conclusion driving around in general isn't the safest thing ever. Adding an extra distraction that makes driving even more dangerous isn't smart. People shouldn't be mad at laws made because people make bad decisions while driving. Laws are made to keep us safe so if a law to not let people use phones it would help stop accident and other unnecessary injuries or problems.                 ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

In the end, no one benefits from this problem other than the law enforcement team who has worked so hard to stress the importance of no texting while driving and funeral homes that are being paid for burial expenses.

Why Driver's should desist from using their Cell Phones while DrivingHundreds of research indicate that using the cell phone while driving is a dangerous prospect that leads to loss of lives. Statistically, 50 minutes of phone chatter while driving increases the likelihood of a car crash or car accident almost five-fold (Crundall, 2017). Texting has also emerged as an issue but many reported cases indicate talking on the cell phone while driving. In the United States, 20 states have banned the use of hand-held cell phones, while another 48 states have banned text messaging while driving (National Conference of State Legislature [NCSL], 2019). Surprisingly, no state is yet to pass laws banning cell phone use across a multitude of drivers, and this explains the continued rise in cell phone-use induced car and road accidents. The majority of drivers and motorists claims that 'being distracted by mobile phones"" is the leading cause of car and road accidents.

One major issue concerns the risk of using one hand to navigate bends and respond to potential hazards while talking on the phone. According to Crundall (2017), the majority of roads accidents in Europe occur in steep slopes, bends and corners, with 35% of them involving the driver communicating on his/her cell phone. Another issue involves the act of conversation which leads to a loss of concentration - cognitive processing - that ultimately leads to an accident (NCSL, 2019). Scientists from Carnegie Mellon University conducted a simulation study and discovered that the human spatial brain activity is affected when performing dual-task, leading to loss of concertation and hence accidents (Crundall, 2017). Processing of auditory messages becomes a problem when driving and communicating on a cell phone, explaining why a driver, under no circumstances, is required to use his/her cell phone while driving.

Distraction has become a huge part in car crashes and people's injuries. Cellphones has become an important component to many human routines. Therefore, it doesn't come to a surprise or a shocked moment that gadgets such as cellphones, tablets, or any other technology devices are ambiguous. Phones not only put the driver in danger, but also other people such as passengers and the other driver in danger.

So for that exact reason, many states implemented the law to not text while driving or you will get a big, fine ticket just for the safe of other people .

45A33DB5C7F7,"Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. A cell phone put drivers at a greater risk of a wreck. People still use cell phones because they want to be available and keep in touch with other people. They think that handsfree set is safe because they can drive using two hands. They use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

People whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. They can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to an injury.. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. Hands Free don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. It show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. People have proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man work, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

People say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident. If people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.                                                      ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

At this point you're thinking to yourself, ""why the freak did this happen?"" A couple hours later you found out an adult was on his phone texting and driving before the wreck happened, which is the most selfish thing to do while driving. Putting your life and other's lives in danger just so you can send a stupid text to your girl/boyfriend is completely selfish. I firmly believe that we need stricter phone laws to in jail people.

Texting while driving is in the top five causes for deaths, and yet many states do not have laws against it. We need to stand together united and encourage our Congressmen to pass laws in order to combat this distraction.

and be mature and adult-like and discuss ways to not further endanger each other.

Cellphones are brain washing us to think we always need it, but I know we can break free from this horrible device with a little hard work we can make a change. What's more important to you: a notification or somebody's life? Our congressmen need to listen to our voices and make bills an laws and reforms to make the roads safer for everyone, we as people need to come together an decide what to do to make things happen, we don't know how much more accidents have to happen in order to push it into effect.

We dedicate our selves to our phones,we cant go 10 minuets without trying to see if we got a notification, the time we spend on our phones is tremendous its up to 6 hours a day!

Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with the their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like STDs. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the electronic device. Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about it also. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving.

People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life.

Phones play a big role in the generation we now live in. We may not realize how phones or electronics in general are affecting society and what we do on a daily basis. These phones are affecting human life slowly from all ages including babies. One of the main impact that cell phones have had on society is the use of them while driving a vehicle and this shouldn't be allowed.

In many cases using a cell phone while driving has had a big impact on society and should be banned in all States. People should not be allowed to use their phones while driving For instance people texting or talking on the phone (physically holding phone)while driving is a big distraction. These people are the causes of accidents and usually innocent people die because of dull decisions people take.

As a result the CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has stated that in 2016, 3,450 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver and the numbers have increased over the years. Also according to them when people take their eyes off for five seconds while going fifty-five mile per hour, it is long enough to cover a football field (""Distracted Driving"") . There are billions of reasons why people go against it and why we should have them banned while driving and this is for our safety.

Everyone on the road is at risk. We can all help out by taking action to prevent innocent people's life. For example by simply just putting away the cell phone, you can prevent so many things and reduce the chances of crashing and you'll be more focused on the road. We can also text or call anyone before starting the car and then put on Do Not Disturb that iphones provide, which does not allow calls or texts from anyone. There are so many options to prevent you touching your phone while driving. We just all have to take action and make the road a safer place .

7C66D3531735,"Should drivers be allowed to use cellphones while driving?

Drivers should not be allowed to text while drive is what I believe statistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teens. 12 million car crashes in 2013 involved crashes in text messages. Texting while driving show that this multitasking at least 341,000 behind the wheel is becoming more dangerous and life threatening now. Because technology will change and new distractions will be involved. According to research conducted at children's hospital teens who don't frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away there the phones while driving outweigh any drawbacks such as being able to pay attention better on the road, and being less likely to have crash and also following the law. Parents should also avoid talking to students as that can also be a big distraction for them. Cellphones aren't just about texting but multi behaviors it's about anything that can cause a distraction from the road such as social media apps , and music have the potential to draw away from the road. Cellphone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent. Texting is undeniably the most dangerous thing a person can do while on the road and its becoming more and more common as the leading causes of death from car crashes are just that and intoxication. Today the majority of humans own and operate cellphones on a daily basis and that's a distraction from what they're doing and can be very dangerous when your driving because you aren't paying any attention to the road and can kill someone.

Something as simple as calling someone can also be dangerous but it's not the leading cause of death. from driver's messages and keeping your eyes on the road is and that's really a major dilemma for someone else who's unaware of that. so I believe that in the future people should always make to keep an open eye for this because it can be very life threatening.

I would consider this age the phone boom since widely now everyone has or owns a communication device and this allows for simple talking and texting time now moves a lot faster than before so people are now trying to catch up with it and that can really become distraction for a lot of people. And those really aren't safe anymore because that can cause car crashes and even death that put you and someone else at a high risk paying attention and being aware is very important you don't want be the cause of someone's death or maybe even a child's death because you were to ignorant to follow the basic law so my plan would be to limit the use of phones on the road while driving and allowing only when you are parked.

The general driving statistics on the national safety reports that that texting while driving made a dramatic increase of 1.6 million crashes an estimated year high. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.

The statistics?

While driving and texting may seem not that much to worry about the death toll seems to speak much for itself. 1 out of 4 accidents and car crashes happen because texting and phone use during driving this seems to be all too common for teens in some areas because according to the AA poll, 94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting which also means there aware of the safety concerns these situations tend to have people nationwide. Teens are more susceptible to car crashes the likely hood of adults they are 4x more likely than adults to get into car crashes or near crashes than adults are prone too. A teen driver who has a passenger in the car doubles the risk more than 5x likely. A cellphone use becomes a national problem there never a reason to risk your life and someone else's to get a simple text in the chances of getting into a car crash with a passenger increase don't be careless is the importance of this drive safe.

In today's current society almost everyone in the world has access or owns a cellular device. That device that can call text or email right from your pocket. While it is so very useful it can also become quite distracting to someone who might be driving. Which leads to the point that Drivers should not be able to access their phones while driving. In these cases its smart to look at the annual driver and cell phone related instances that have happened over the years as well as the averages of crashes involving phones and the driver.

Cell Phone users while they are driving are 5.36 times more likely to get into an accident when driving accordion to a study done at the University of Utah (""Drivers on Cell Phones Are as Bad as Drunks."" University of Utah News, archive. unews. utah. edu/news_releases/drivers-on-cell-phones-are-as-bad-as-drunks/). These statistics show how more likely a driver is to get in an accident while on their cell phones. That isn't a small number 5.36 is a larger number of people when taking into account how many use their phones while driving anyways. This leads into how many people actually die to chances like these.

In 2015 alone there were 3,477 people killed in a distracted driver accident. 476 of which in those cases were cell phone users.(""Learn the Facts About Distracted Driving."" EndDD, www. enddd. org/the-facts-about-distracted-driving/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwoaz3BRDnARIsAF1RfLevzm7d8WG_o9fmbSLCDrfzuhq4pSz6LYGnFCL65o0N-OBsj-T8u8YaAh1_EALw_wcB.). These numbers when taking into account how those deaths could have been prevented by simply putting the phone down while driving are extremely high. That is 13 percent of all drivers that died last year were on their phones. And those people would still be alive had they put the phone down.

These statistics do not lie when saying how people die due to cellular phones being used while driving. With that when 13 percent of the annual driving related deaths are all cellphone based and with the ever growing world that number will go up. That is unless the Driver puts the phone downs while he drives.            ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

In this day in age of technological advancement, mankind has quickly adapted to using devices such as cellphones. It has gotten to the point where we constantly use it for everything we do. There seems to be many good qualities about the cellphone which humans seem to keep all are attention on. That in turn causes problems with our surroundings such as being on the phone and driving a vehicle.

There is no denying that cellphones take up all of our attention. There are just so many things that we are able to do that makers have put in it. It is just to ensure that we never get bored while also waiting for the next phone with technological superiority to be released. Likewise, with driving. It takes up all of our focus to make sure we don't get into a car wreck. In a way, driving and being on a cellphone are very similar in regards to how much attention we give it. So when putting both together, the ending result are what you would expect it to be, catastrophic.

Cellphones and driving take up a lot of focus and because of that, we constantly are switching from looking at our phones to paying attention to the road and oncoming traffic ahead (assuming there is any that is). They do not balance out well and people can easily get into car accidents as a result. This most notably happens when a person is trying to text and drive at the same time. It was this very reason why texting and driving has been made illegal to ensure the safety of fellow drivers. You would think the problems lay with teenagers doing it, but adults have a higher statistic level when it comes to this, providing more fatality rates to go up. Add that in with alcohol and there is no telling what will happen.

In the end, we just should not use our phones while we drive. It quickly turns into a habit once we start and it will not end well. It can also result in being arrested if caught by a local police officer. We should get everything out of the way before we start driving or stop and park somewhere before we engage into the activities on our phone. There are plenty of safe ways to use a phone while inside of a vehicle, we just choose the most dangerous route.

The first thing they do is check and see what popped up on their phone. The worst time for this to happen is when they're driving because they will still cheak no matter what they're doing. Using your phone while driving can cause you to get a ticket, cause you to hurt someone, and even cause you to hurt yourself.

People may think nothing of driving and being on their phone. Police always advertise to let others know not to use their phones while driving but they refuse to listen. Now if a police officer catch anyone on their phone while driving they will get a ticket. Everyone hates when authority stops them. It's the worst feeling ever and to make it worst is for the reason to be just being on your phone.

If people are driving and on their phone they're not focused on what's in front of them. Anything can pop up in front of the vehicle at any time. Things like animals, people, and even cyclist can appear in front once you up from your phone. The only problem is the driver may not look up in time and hit someone or something. There is a possibility that whoever the driver hit could suffer major injuries or even death.

Not only are you putting others in danger, you're also putting yourself in danger. Like mentioned before, anything can pop up in front of you vehicle. This time around it can be another car, truck, or even a bus. Crashing into one these just from being on a phone can possibility cause instant death. Maybe you might have quick reflexes and try to avoid collision. There is a possibility still hit something else like a tree. Some may be lucky enough to only be injured or not harmed at all.

In the end, using your phone while driving can result in you getting in serious trouble or causing harm to yourself and others. Authority can stop you if they notice it. Other citizens can harmed by you for not paying attention. Also you can harm yourself. Just do not do it because it's not worth it. It can wait.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

To start things off, I believe that there is a time and place for being on your phone with behind the wheel. If you are at a red light and you don't have to type or just have to answer a call or change a song i believe that is an acceptation to the rule of being on your phone. Since we are in the time and age were we have Bluetooth in cars and can connect to our phones so it makes it easier to call and or answer calls. Texting and driving is a must stop because you may think that you will be fine and can multitask but in reality you are putting you and the other drivers in danger. No one's parents should have to attend their child's funeral because they died from texting and driving or because someone else was texting and driving. There are many reasons not to use a phone while driving but there are also exceptions to this rule now you may not agree with me on this but this to me is the best actions to do because people will not stop with getting on their phones while driving but at least we could limit it to just a few ways that they could get on it while being behind the wheel.

Secondly, with technology still evolving in this day like now they are getting driverless cars that may be the next big step in the world of vehicles. Now with these cars we don't need to worry about the needs of driving cars if there is no steering wheel.

Every day about 11 teens die due to texting and driving in the United States but with today's technology they are trying to help stop texting and driving but everything we do doesn't seem to be helping and or stopping teens from texting behind the wheel. Some people still might not agree with me on what I believe is important but if you just give it some years maybe just maybe it may be possible in today's society that no one can get hurt from texting and driving.

Lastly, although it's a big problem for people to stop texting and driving, it's not a ban in every state in the United States. It's said that only 39 states put a ban for novice drivers because it isn't the biggest deal for some people to be able to text and drive which I know doesn't sound great but it's kind of the truth in a way. I personally have no experience of this because I can't drive but i see people who do drive and do this and it's not like it's every time it mainly at red lights you see them doing it. Now out the 39 states 20 of them ban it for school bus drivers also.

It's taken the USA almost 14 years and people still don't listen to no texting and driving.

To conclude, have you ever been behind some or seen someone texting and driving? I got to tell you some facts that maybe you didn't know about texting and driving and even I learned something new. I also gave some changes that could happen in the near future that could change how we see texting and driving.       ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Smartphones are a class of mobile phones and of multi-purpose mobile computing devices. They are distinguished from feature phones by their stronger hardware capabilities and extensive mobile operating systems, which facilitate wider software, internet (including web browsing over mobile broadband), and multimedia functionality (including music, video, cameras, and gaming), alongside core phone functions such as voice calls and text messaging. Smartphones Were founded in 1992. Since smartphones were created every year they get more modern. For example june 7, 2010 facetime was created. The smartphone is changing the human race in surprising ways.

Driving and using your cell phone at the same time is very dangerous. Most people think that they can drive so being on their phone while driving wont hurt anybody or anything, but anybody who agrees with this is wrong and is in danger every time he/ she pulls out a phone while the car is in drive. Also, if you use your cellular device and drive at the same time you always have someone else's life at stake. Even if you're in the car by yourself you can hurt someone else, imagine you have your head down in your phone while driving and you look up and you about to hit a car and swerve to the right and hit a whole family walking on the sidewalk. Then your in a bad situation just because you couldn't wait till you get home to text or look at your instagram feed. One little bad time to look at your phone and your hurting a family.

I believe that you shouldn't be allowed to use your phone while your car is in drive. In georgia they made a new law that you can't have your phone in your hand while on the road,not even to tap play and if you get caught the law enforcement will pull you over and give you a $50 fine. I believe it should be like this in every state , it the makes the community a lot safer. Did you know 11 teens die every day as a result of texting while driving. As of January 2019, three states -- Arizona, Montana, and Missouri -- insanely do not have laws against texting while driving.

According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers knows the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway. 21% of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were distracted by their cell phones. The 2017 study published by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety Found that 87% of drivers view texting and driving as the most significant hazard on the road. In fact, drivers are more concerned about texting / distracted driving than they are about drunk driving. A single text can end many lives.

In conclusion, using your cellular device while driving is dangerous on all cases. Texting while driving causes 5 times as many accidents than drunk driving. A single text results in an average distraction of 5 seconds, during which time a car going 55 mph will travel the length of a football field.

As we drove to the final basketball game of the season against our rivals Milton High School, I was having a great time with my best friend. Paige and I were stopped at the intersection on Highway 9 when a white SUV crashed into the back of her Nissan Rogue. We were both rushed to the hospital where my friend learned that her leg was broken in two places. Paige could not finish the rest of her swim season and was absolutely devastated. We later found out that the driver behind us was looking down at her cell phone and didn't notice that the light had turned red. The driver's one second of distracted driving affected my best friend's life for months although, thankfully, her use of a cell phone did not end it. As a result of the risk to the public, drivers should not be allowed to use handheld cell phones while operating a vehicle.

Operating a vehicle requires attention and focus. Anything that interrupts a driver's concentration leads to a dangerous distraction. Three main types of distracted driving are visual, manual, and cognitive. Drivers who text and drive, snap and drive, instagram and drive, or simply call home while driving are endangering the public. Texting while driving is particularly harmful because it combines all three types of distracted driving . According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drivers who send or read a text while driving lose concentration and take their eyes off the road for up to five seconds. Those five seconds of using a handheld cell phone are a great risk to the public.

Statistics show that using a handheld phone while operating a moving vehicle risks the welfare of the public. In ""Cell Phone Use and Driving,"" Louis Hugo Francescutti states that using a cell phone while driving increases the risk of collisions four to six times, and drivers are twice as often to be in a rear-end collision. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports that nine people are killed each day, and the public is involved in more than one-thousand car crashes due to distracted driving. Francescutti writes that researchers believe that distracted driving causes twenty-five to ninety percent of car collisions. Clearly, these statistics demonstrate the danger of distracted driving.

Although distracted driving causes over four thousand deaths each year, there are solutions to this tragedy. One obvious solution is not using the phone at all while driving; however, other possible solutions include the use of bluetooth and phone mounts to decrease the number of deaths. Since driving requires attention and focus, making the choice not to use the phone while driving limits the risk to the driver and to the public. When absolutely necessary, the use of bluetooth and phone mounts can offer drivers phone access while still protecting the public. These two alternatives should only be used in case of an emergency.

Clearly, operating a vehicle while using a handheld cell phone is dangerous. Georgia recognized these dangers and passed legislation to prevent the use of handheld devices when driving; however, some drivers fail to follow the law. The driver who caused my accident received a citation for using her device while driving. Hopefully, the next time she goes out on the road she will think about the danger to others and act responsibly.

Cell phones have become a key factor in many lives today. People tend to use cell phones for just about any and everything. As a people, we tend to rely on our phones at any given moment. Since the invention of telephones, society has been using phones for texting, talking, social media, etc. For those uses, cell phones have put us at risk. We tend to use or cell phones when we are walking across the street, and most importantly when we are driving. Operating a car while texting/talking results in the driver becoming a hazard to other drivers on the road.

Firstly, there is no doubt that we are addicted to our phones. Our phones have led us to be distracted. A distraction is something that prevents someone from giving their full attention to something else. For instance, when we are driving, we hear our phones ring and instantly we pick it up to answer. It is the inner use telling us that we are amazing drivers, and that one little call will not distract us from the road. In all reality, one little phone call does distract us from when the light changes, or when someone needs to get over to the other lane. Cell phones reduce driving performance.

As well as that, drivers have to operate both the phone and the car, which leads to car accidents. Using the cell phone and driving the car at the same time, reduces the drivers ability to concentrate on the road. All it takes is two seconds to look down at the phone, and the next thing you know, you have caused a life or yours. Car accidents are well known in the community to be caused by texting and driving. Not to mention, being on the phone and driving-slows down reactions to traffic lights and other traffic events, which also causes car accidents. Equally important, during bad weather on slippery road, engaging in conversation equals to paying less attention to the road increasing fatal accidents.

Although, there are negative impacts of texting and driving, it could also be beneficial. The beneficial parts could consists of using it for emergency purposes. For example, calling for assistance on the side of the road, reporting an incident while driving, or simply calling for help. In addition, cell phones can be used for navigation to an unknown destination. Cell phones always provide you with information about news, weather, and alerts for any city you are driving in.

In conclusion,it can be concluded that texting is not only an effective way of communication, but always a safety concern. Different studies have shown that many accidents are caused by phones and driving daily. Phones and driving is a dangerous habit people have picked up on. How many people are going to have to get hurt before realize their actions have consequences? We have to understand that phones and driving is extremely dangerous, and has to be stopped.

Phones have become an essential of human lives, 68% of Americans own smartphones. Some people use it for entertainment and others use it for education and work, but it can also be distracting because people can not put it away even while driving. Nearly 40,000 each year are injured or killed due to a phone caused car crash in the United States. Even though phones can be devastating, they can be used to contact emergency authorities during a crisis on the road, on the other hand they can be hazardous when used for any other reason like calling, texting, or anything else related to looking away from the road.

There is a four second interval between a phone related car crash, a phone rings the driver takes their eyes for at least two seconds to find it, then they answer it before looking back on the road, at this point it can be too late to prevent a fatal crash. The drivers sense of sight, hearing and hand coordination are temporarily lost. Driving is a serious and dangerous task, all attention should be focused on the road, so the individual can drive safely for themselves and other roadway users.

Using your phone while driving is basically like closing your eyes and taking your hands off the wheel. The driver can potentially harm roadway users around them like pedestrians, bikers, truck drivers, and motorcycles. According to the Association for Safe International

Travel, ""Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year, on average 3,287 deaths a day. An additional 20-50 million are injured or disabled. More than half of all road traffic deaths occur among young adults ages 15-44.

Each year nearly 400,000 people under 25 die on the world's roads, on average over 1,000 a day."" Many of the crashes could have been prevented if drivers had full attention on the road.

Some of the newer cars are fitted with the handsfree mode where the driver connects their phone through bluetooth. This helps drivers decrease hazards if it is used properly, and there are now cars with autopilot. It helps to put your phone on do not disturb mode or putting it somewhere requiring you to stop and safely use it. Many states are now passing a strict no phone policy in cars, like Georgia if a police see a driver with a phone in their hand they can now be fined.

People have to become more responsible while in the cars, they should always remember to wear seatbelts, use their phone only when there of the road and parked somewhere safe. If used correctly phone can be useful for emergency situation on the road, but they can also be a danger for the individual and other people around them if they are used incorrectly.

Phone use while driving has become extremely common in this day and age. Almost everyone that's driven a car has done it, and they know it. A lot of people do it, but that obviously doesn't make it right. Of course lots of things have come out so that we won't have the phone in our hands while driving, but who said that having a phone in your hand is the only problem? Phones cause for distractions, accidents, and possibly even jail time.

The last thing that you want while driving is to get distracted. I think I could say the same thing for a passenger. Have you ever been in a car with someone and they start looking at their phone?

Have they ever got on the phone and laughed so hard that they close their eyes while driving? It's not a good feeling to be in a situation such as that cause you worry about your life. Hands-free calls are good but just because they don't have a phone in their hand does not mean a person still cannot get distracted due to the use of a phone.

Distraction due to phones could result in multiple things. One of the things it can result in is pedestrians getting hurt. In the state of Georgia, Pedestrians are given the right-of-way when crossing a marked crosswalk. Pedestrians are required to yield the right-of-way to oncoming vehicles when crossing the street without a marked crosswalk. If drivers aren't paying attention then they might just hit a pedestrian and it might just be on the driver. Drivers could be so distracted due to cell phones that they run a stop light and end up hitting a pedestrian.

One of the main reasons for car wrecks in the United States is not driving under the influence or speeding. The main cause for car wrecks in America is distracted driving. People don't realize how easily a person could get in a car wreck. Looking at a text or notification on your phone could take your eyes off the road for almost 5 seconds. 5 seconds doesn't sound like a lot of time but it really doesn't even take a full second for a car wreck to actually happen.

When using your phone while driving, you should ask yourself a few questions. Do I want to possibly go to jail today? Do I want to possibly crash today? Do I want to possibly take a life today? These are questions you should ask yourself before picking up that phone and reading that text or even talking to someone on the phone. Don't be selfish. Think about other people and the impact that using your phone while driving could possibly have on others. Put the phone down and get where you need to go.

Over the year many states have banned using cellphones while driving. Some people tend not to listen and still use it and that causes a lot of people lives. Should people use their phone while driving? No one should be using their cellphones while driving. It's not safe for you, the person next to you, or the person that you hit, insurance rate goes up, and its illegal.

People thinks that they can use their phones while driving but end up causing people lives even themselves. In 2018 half a million people were injured because of texting and driving. In an article of ""Facts & Statistics About Texting & Driving (Updated for 2018)"" it claims ""With the latest statistics available as of 2018, in 2015, according to statistics compiled by the Department of Transportation, 3,477 people died and another 391,000 were injured in motor vehicle crashes caused by drivers who were distracted because they were texting or using cell phones."" Don't let anything distract you from taking your eyes off the roads.

Depending on what auto insurance people have, when you get into an accident your insurance will go up. In an article ""Just how much does car insurance go up after an accident?"" it said that ""Insurers once followed the Insurance Services Office's (ISO) standard of increasing a premium by 20 to 40 percent of the insurer's base rate after an accident."" If you drive a brand new car that you pay for it, you wouldn't want your insurance to higher then your car bills. Specially if you are a young adult trying to figure things out, you will be making the worst mistake if you let your phone have your attention.

In most state it's illegal to text while driving. There are 41 state that ban texting while driving because of distractions. In the article ""Texting While Driving May Be Common, But It's Illegal In Most States"" it stated,

""In all but four of those states, texting while driving is a primary offense, meaning you can get pulled over and ticketed simply for that alone; in Florida, Iowa, Nebraska and Ohio, you can get ticketed for texting only if you were pulled over for some other offense, such as speeding. (By comparison, only 12 states, along with Washington, D.C., ban all drivers from using handheld mobile phones.)"" Don't get distracted and get pulled over because your friends or family is texting you. If anything it only takes a minute to pull over and do what you need to do. You don't want anything to happen to your safety.

Life is too short for anyone to risk it. Witnessing a distracted driver is very scary, life is never promised for tomorrow. Rethink about your choice, is it that important to risk anything? People are way too naive to know what's right from wrong, moral of the story don't text while driving.               ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8
10F1B47C95E6,"Cell phones. Almost everyone has them but over the past couple of years have they became a issue where they have caused peoples life's. Many people find the time to be on there phones anywhere at anytime they want including while driving. People have been putting each other in danger just to see a text or a notification while not paying attention to the road this simple action can cause a person to lose there life.

Image a teenage girl first time on the road and is finally able to have her freedom and rights of driving. The girl is driving carefully and responsibly until she gets a notification from her boyfriend saying ""we need to talk"". The girl hesitates to answer the text message while she is looking back and forth from the road to her phone until she finally grabs the phone from the cup holder. She started to text back her boyfriend while running a red light and getting T-boned on her side of the car causing a crash. This is just one of the million possibility's that could happen while texting and driving. This is also a reason as to why under no conditions should a person text while drive. What if the girl didn't pick up the phone? What if instead she turned it off or pulled over onto the side of the road. A text message will be there forever but your life dose not.

Not only are you putting your life at risk but you are also putting other peoples life at risk. For example there's a man driving a truck and just got a text message from his wife he figures that since there is no one on the road nothing bad would happen so while he is texting while driving he dose not notices a boy riding a bike crossing the street he looks up from his phone and realizes whats about to happen and steps on the breaks on time. What if he didn't stop on time what if he kept texting. his actions did not effect him but it effected others such as that little boy. This is why for no reason should you text call or face time while drive it dose not matter how you do it you are still putting other peoples life at stake including your own.

In conclusion drivers should never text while drive because you are then putting your life and others at risk. If only drivers would think before they do something then maybe more people would be alive today. Maybe the girl in the car crash would be alive today maybe the boy riding his bike would be alive today. Driving is a privilege and a responsibility. You are not only driving for yourself but for everybody. A text message can last forever but your life will not.    ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Research Shows that using cell phones while driving nearly doubles the risk of a negative outcome occurring. As mediocre as that sounds it could lead to fatal car crashes, Injuring a pedestrian or even punishment for distracted driving.

According to Edgar Snyder & Associates Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. ""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". The outcome of texting while driving is not that important to where lives should be taken to send a text if it's that important then why not just pull over. in the article on edgar Snyder & Associates it also states that 10 percent of all teen motor vehicle crash fatalities in 2016 involved distracted driving. The risk is increasing every time a person pulls out there cell phone.

In the article that was posted on USA Today it stated that ""U.S pedestrians death totaled nearly 6,000 in 2017 for the second straight year amid signs that walkers and distracted drivers do not mix.""Also it states that texting while driving is more risky in a urban environments. Teens that text and drive are more likely to get into an accident than an adult that is even though both are risky studies show that being young while doing it is worse than being older while doing it. The issue at hand is affecting everyone texting while driving or just being on your phone is a bad mix and innocent children and adults are suffering because of it.

Texting while driving can result in many punishments like Monetary fines, Criminal charges and jail or prison time. According to Legalmatch ""Texting while driving is a moving traffic violation and may be a criminal misdemeanor in certain jurisdictions"".

Also,Jail or prison time if the offense has resulted in bodily injury to another driver, jail or prison time may be imposed. The more you get caught texting and driving the worse the punishment will be it could start off with a simple fine and the next time you could be serving jail time. Finally, If you have been hurt due to someones else mistakes you are entitled to compensation at which you can sue them.

In Conclusion, Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The outcome of this can hurt the drivers mentally, physically and even emotionally (if they take someones life in the process).Texting while driving is now one of the most reason drivers are getting fined as technology advances peoples urge to use their cellphones are growing tremendously.

Driving with a cell phone is very common, yet very dangerous at the same time. This is because phones tend to cause a distraction among, not just teens, but adults as well. Driving with phones have become so crucial, it has become against the law to drive with a phone in hand. The leading cause of teenage deaths in America are car accidents. The fatal crash rate for teens is three times greater than drivers ages twenty and over. Having phone in hand while driving has made for numerous unfortunate deaths for people. The main cause is not being focused on getting to a destined location before picking up a phone. The situation has gotten so severe, the Apple company( made for iPhone), has taken matters into their own hands. They have created 'do not disturb' to detect when a person is in a moving car at certain miles per hour, to keep them from having any distractions as far as notifications or calls.

There have been inventions made to lessen the use of phones while driving, so as the phone holder and using bluetooth connected to a car. Though these things are helpful, it still can be a distraction while driving; as far as maneuvering to answer a call and inserting a phone into a phone holder. Driver distraction is responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. After reviewing this information, it's more favorable to not use a cellular device at all whatsoever while behind a wheel. By putting the phone down and taking small steps toward safe driving, even if it takes pulling the car over, will help lower crash/death rates around the globe. In conclusion, phones and driving do not coincide well, and should be prevented no matter what the cause is.

Driving while being on the phone is very dangerous. No one should be operating a vehicle and using technology. It can ruin your life. People don't think before they do stuff and it doesn't always end good. You might think you can pay attention to the road and drive at the same time, but you never know until its too late. Many wrecks have been caused by people texting and driving. You could look up at the road one second too late and take someone's life.

Most teens are addicted to their phone and right when it buzzes, they grab it and check it. They can't even drive without them. You could swerve while on your phone, stop too late, or never see the person walking. Just like that someone's hurt and its your fault. Driving is a serious thing. You don't have to just worry about your life but the other peoples on the road's life too. Not everyone can see the same thing, so all your attention needs to be on the road.

That's why you shouldn't drive and be on your phone. Its very dangerous and can take someone's life. You never know when that day will be. You can never be certain on what will happen.

Before cell phones were invented car accidents were shockingly low compared to the numbers we see today. Texting and driving are six times more likely to cause an accident than driving intoxicated. Over 1.6 million crashes a year in the US are linked to cell phone distraction. There needs to be something done to stop this.

If someone is caught texting and driving, there should be a worse punishment than a small ticket. People are putting people in danger every single day doing this. Approximately 660,000 people are using their phones right now while driving. Texting and driving are considered the most dangerous activity to do while driving. Nearly 390,000 injuries a year are caused from texting and driving. Texting causes a 400% increase of distraction while driving.

Even people that text and drive want something to be done about it. 94% percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving, and 74% of drivers support a ban of hand-held cell phone use while driving. A AAA poll showed that 94% of teen drivers know about the cell phone laws and the dangers of doing it, and 35% admitted to doing it. 21% percent of all teen accidents are caused by cell phone usage. Teens are 4 times likely to get into an accident or a near miss than an adult when talking or texting on a cell phone. 3,166 people were killed by distracted driving in 2017. 15,341 people between the age of 15-29 have been involved in fatal accidents involving cell phone usage.

There is too much risk involving cell phones and driving, thousands of people die a year involving cell phones. If something can be done about this then many lives would be saved.

42048FB6EC2B,"Drivers should absolutely never be able to use a cell phone while driving. This is evident as in recent years there has been a big problem in our society with drivers using their cell phones while driving. It has gotten so bad that it has become illegal because driving while using a cell phone is more likely to be the cause of a fatal accident, than when a person drives under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Use a hands free device at all times while driving. I say this because a cell phone will take your attention off of the task at hand. A driver's focus should be maintained on only driving to ensure safety. It has been proven that driving while using a cell phone is the cause of more vehicular accidents resulting in a fatality than those caused by drivers who are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

In two thousand and thirteen there were three thousand one hundred fifty-four people killed in distracted driver related crashes. In just one year's time, there are three hundred and ninety thousand people injured in accidents caused by texting and driving. I personally do not use my cell phone when I drive, because it distracts me very easily. I suggest that drivers should be able to use their cell phone for an emergency purpose only. Even in a crisis situation, the driver should pull over to the side of the road before making a call.

I also encourage that the cell phone companies should be made to have the cell phone come from the factory to where if your cellphone is moving, it will not be allowed to ring or give you any notifications. In order to get your notifications, you will have to manually tell your cellphone to read that you are not driving for it to allow you to open the phone. It will then give you the notifications and or missed calls you have missed. In addition, it will not allow you to access absolutely any of your social media platforms or let you get social media notifications while you are driving.

In conclusion, my opinion on whether drivers should be using their cell phones while driving is that they should refrain from using their cell phone while driving. This is because driving is a task that requires a lot of focus and a cell phone is very distracting.

Drivers should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle, because there are several risks that could happen. For instance insurance rates will hike. Also, you are more than likely to have a wreck. Lastly, if there are people in the car you should always consider your passengers.

Your insurance rates are priced by a complex equation (Rate factors) which include: Age, Car make and model, Gender, Location, Driving history. Causing a car accident often leads to higher insurance premiums. Even if your rates don't go up after an accident, you could lose your good drivers discount.

Many of us want the right to text and drive in our cars, but study shows that texting while driving causes accidents. For the people driving older cars, texting while driving is a safety hazard. It's Now Illegal to Text while druving, due to the many accidents. Overall being distracted in any way makes you a worse driver than you would be if you were completely focused on the road. Also, talking to passengers can affect you driving skills, even though it's socially accepted and nearly unsafe.

Texting and driving puts all the drivers sharing the road with you at risk to. That's because, you are unable to navigate the road while looking down at the phone in your lap. If you were to hit someone while texting and driving, more than likely you will end up in jail.

The best way to end texting while driving is to educate, especially our teenagers. Depending your age, you might already be considered a risk. Teens pay the highest insurance rates in the country, followed by the elderly seniors. Teens or seniors who cause minor accidents rarely get a break from their insurers.

Many states have made the use of cell phones while driving illegal due to the number of accidents that are related to conducting calls and texting. Many states have also created laws to ban handheld mobile phone use. Cell phone usage has become the leading cause of distracted driving. Drivers can easily become distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car accidents. I agree with cell phones being banned while driving.

I believe that driving while using a cell phone should be banned because of the drastic increase in accidents. On one occasion, my mom was hit from behind because the person in the car behind her was texting on a cell phone. Fortunately my mom was not seriously hurt because the driver behind her was not driving at a high speed. If the driver in the car behind my mom was driving at a higher speed, my mom could have been severely injured or killed. Banning cell phone usage while driving enables a driver to remain focused and to keep the appropriate amount of distance between vehicles.

A driver can't focus on the road or other vehicles while consistently talking or texting on a cell phone. Studies have proven that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents.

Cell phone usage while driving has caused car insurance premiums to increase. My mom's car insurance increased an additional $15 a month this year. That additional $15 can go towards gas to get us back and forth to school, work, church, etc. Her car insurance agent advised her that rates have increased across the board; distracted driving was the main reason for the increase. I earned my learner's permit this year. My mom is afraid to teach me how to drive because of her fear of distracted driving. I will be attending a defensive driving school to learn how to drive. My mom is not looking forward to adding me as a driver on her car insurance because her premium is going to increase drastically.

She often complains about distracted driving contributing to higher car insurance rates. I don't bother my mom about teaching me how to drive for now; she takes me wherever I need to go. I'm about to graduate from high school, and it is my intent to attend college or go to the military. I have to learn how to drive very soon, but I'm really not looking forward to it.

Society has become more connected to cell phones more than ever. Cell phones provide a lot of convenience. From communicating with relatives and friends, checking emails, paying bills, taking pictures, recording videos, listening to music; you name it! However, talking or texting on cell phones while driving simply don't mix and has become a huge issue in the past few years.

Everybody has their own opinion regarding cell phone usage while operating a vehicle, but I believe that using cell phones while driving should not be allowed. Using a cell phone while driving has the driver focusing on the phone instead of the road. This increases the time it takes for a driver to react effectively. In case of an emergency; the driver should pull over in a safe zone and then call for assistance. The main reason for most car accidents in today's society is driving while using a cell phone.

I urge my family, friends and anyone reading this essay to take the ""AT&T It Can Wait"" pledge against distracted driving at ""www. itcanwait. com"". ""Join the millions who have pledged to drive distraction free.

There are three types of distractions, visual, manual, and cognitive. Visual distractions cause you to take your eyes off the road, manual distractions are anything that causes you to take your hands off of your steering wheel, and cognitive distractions are anything that causes you to take your eyes off of the road. Throughout the years, over 3,447 people were killed by distracted drivers. Drivers 20 years old or younger are more susceptible to falling into the ring of distracted drivers. With today's advanced social media platform a new and dangerous trend surfaced the web and went viral. The creators of the app ""Snapchat"" added a filter to the application that allows users to track their mph speed. This filter promotes distracted driving.

According to the Washington Post, Christal McGee, an 18 year old, was behind the wheel of her father's white Mercedes, on her way home from work on a Thursday night in September 2015, when she pulled out her phone and opened Snapchat. McGee wanted to try the filter out, so McGee, then accelerated some more, reaching 113 miles per hour on a suburban road outside Atlanta and the speed limit was 55. She didn't see Maynard Wentworth, an Uber driver just starting his shift that night, until it was too late. She hit him at 107 miles per hour. Wentworth suffered a traumatic brain injury and was hospitalized for months. McGee was sued and the infamous app was also sued for negligence.

The accidents and lives taken could have been easily prevented and still can. Drivers are encouraged every day to put their phones down when they drive to prevent accidents, but they do not take them seriously. A death of someone at the hands of a distracted driver could easily prevent many deaths. The choice of responding to a text message or saving someone's life should be of no ignorance. As of July 1st, Georgia's Hands Free Law was passed to keep cellphones out of people's hands as they drive.

Many humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Although, this may be a norm in our daily routines, some people risk their lives by using their cell phones while operating a motor vehicle. By doing this, people can cause a hazardous driving experiences for themselves and others. The dangers can include, distractions that cause car accidents, property loss or even death. With the potential that phone usage and driving can cause so much harm, it should be a legal band to cease all cell phone usage while driving.

In 2018, the state of Georgia adopted the ""hands-free"" law. This law doesn't allow the phone to touch any part of the body while driving a motor vehicle. This means that any touching, texting, calling, dialing, reading emails, surfing the internet, recording, etc. are all banned while driving. Doing any of these activities cause distracting conditions that are dangerous and unsafe and can result in the driver straying, losing control of the vehicle, or crash.

According to NHTSA, 3,166 people died as a result of distracted driving, in 2017.

With this understanding, nothing on your phone is worth that much of your attention.

Death is a real possibility if the law is not taken seriously. In Georgia, there are about 4 accident related deaths per day and nearly 1,500 fatalities per year. A quick glance at your phone or taking your eyes off the road for as long as 30 seconds, can escalate to a lifetime of regret, pain, and sorrow for yourself or someone else's family.

This reason alone, should serve as enough rational to band cell phone usage all together or maximize the cost of fines for offenders of the ""hands-free"" law.

In the event, that there is an accident that is caused by violating the ""hands-free"" law or distracted driving caused by phone usage, it has unforeseen financial damages, as well. Although, insurance is meant to protect us, it's still at a cost. Each year it cost about $230.6 billion to United States residents for accident claims. This can place a heavy burden on any family that is under prepared for life's unexpected turns.

In conclusion, there are so many things in life that we cannot control that can result in financial burdens or death, we should ask ourselves is answering a text worth my life? I'm guessing its not but so often, we risk our safety to do just that. Not using the phone while driving is a behavior that can be controlled, especially, if we consider how important life, focus, and finances are. If we take the time to put the phones down while driving we can ""arrive alive.""                ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

In today's society many phones have become an essential part of life. We use our phones everyday to talk, text, share pictures/ videos, and to use gps locaters. Although we are on our cell phones daily for various reasons there is a time and a place to use them. One time you should never use your cell phone is when operating a motor vehicle. The use of a cell phone can lead to many fatalities that can harm you or others.

Texting while driving can be distracting, dangerous, and can lead to a accident. Picking up your phone for even a second means that your attention is not on the road and can lead to a fatal even deadly crash. Texting while driving is a manual, visual, and cognitive distraction. Taking one or more hand off the steering wheel is an example of an manual distraction and not having both hands on the wheel can lead to you not having complete control over the vehicle. Not having your eyes on the road is an example of a visual distraction and can lead to you crashing into something. Lastly, texting and driving is an example of a cognitive distraction because you are not focused on the road.

Taking your eyes off the road can lead to a horrific accident that can cause harm to yourself or others. You should always be considerate of others around you whether its passengers in the car or pedestrians around you. Distracted driving means that while you aren't paying attention you could be crashing into someone and possibly taking their life. When looking down at your cell phone you aren't able to pay attention to what's going on around you nor will you be able to see a pedestrian. Will you be able to live with yourself knowing that you were the reason someone's life got taken away from them because of you?

In todays technology there are many alternatives to texting and driving. Cars now have wireless Bluetooth where you can answer the phone with a click of the button on your steering wheel. You can also speak your text messages so you don't have to look at your phone and divert your attention from the road. Even if you don't have a car with Bluetooth cell phones now come with a hands free feature and a do not disturb while driving feature. Manufactures are making it easier and easier to drive safely while also still being able to communicate effectively and efficiently with others.

In conclusion, texting while driving can be extremely dangerous and should never be an option. It can lead to accidents and will distract you from the road. Once you take your eyes off the road you are not only putting yourself in danger but others too. There are too many new alternatives if you need you use your cell phone while driving therefore the percentages of deaths due to distracted drivers should not increase.

Drivers should not use a phone unless they are using it as a navigational device to get to a destination. If used in any other way it is very dangerous and will cause serious accidents to them and other drivers as well. Driving while using cell phones cause major problems that could've been avoided if they weren't using a phone. According to statistics in 2018 9 deaths and 1,000 injuries per day have occured due to distracted driving

One problem that cell phones cause while driving are swerving off of roads while driving at high speeds. Swerving could cause other drivers to have accidents because they tried to avoid the person that was swerving. If they weren't on their phones that probably wouldn't have happened.

Another problem is self proclaimed accidents. Some reasons this happens is because the person was probably texting while driving and they took their eyes off the road. This is the most common problem that people have mostly among teen drivers. It is 6 times more likely to cause an accident if someone is texting and driving that driving under under the influence.

Playing video games on cell phones while driving is another problem because people often like to have some type of entertainment while driving. This could often cause road rage while they are driving because something probably happened and they got mad. Some app developers have started making video game apps that blocks a person out of the app while they are driving.

All of these problems that are caused by cell phones can be avoided if people use their cell phones wisely. Improper use of cell phones put their lives and other people's lives in danger.

In my opinion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones at all while in a vehicle. I think this, because even with these new cell phone laws some people still use their cell phones while driving. So with these laws it should make the chance of accidents less possible, and police can write tickets so people are less likely to do it again. Now, all new cars are able to have bluetooth and touch screen and unless you have a very old car that shouldn't be an issue anymore.

However, the reality is, most of the drivers are still using cell phones while driving and I guess it's not that easy for the police to catch them.

With bluetooth you just swipe to pick up a phone call and automatically connect to your car nowadays. Many people tend to think it's not a big deal to just swipe -it takes only a second. I do think so as well. That one second could cost you a life or somebody's life.

What can stop drivers' using cell phones while driving?

The simplest but most difficult is each driver has a strong will not to touch the phone during driving. Police can set more camera (not only at the traffic lights but on normal roads) so that cameras can catch drivers who are using the phones. Once ""Restriction on cell phones while driving"" law becomes nationwide, cell phones should be made to get disabled near the driving seat once car starts moving.

All around the world people are constantly trying to decrease safety risks. Driving has become one of those risks to safety. Since cellular phones have grown to be popular. People often use them everywhere and in their car is no exception. At first this was great. You could be on a work call while you were on your way home. Or you could be checking to see if anyone else wanted food where you were eating at. Although this has brought much convenience, utility and entertainment. It also has brought great risk to safety while driving. Drivers become distracted and make more mistakes than usual. Causing more accidents. There is a big discussion over whether you should be able to use your phone while driving or not. I believe that phones should not be allowed to be used in cars.

One reason that cell phones shouldn't be allowed is simply because you can last the car ride without using it. With the exception of an emergency of course. If something is important than you can pull over and make a call while getting gas or something. And everyone would be better off paying less car insurance. Also, if you have kids and display that you don't value safety, then they may follow and do the same and even worse.

Another reason is that it puts everyone at risk including themselves. If everyone was on their phone while driving. We would probably have close to double the amount of accidents. Just for a little convenience. Studies show that texting and driving is more debilitating to your reaction time than driving while under the influence of alcohol.

Humans are smaller and less noticeable than vehicles, making the likelihood of seeing a pedestrian much less than that of a car. And hitting a ton car is different than hitting a pedestrian. The pedestrian would likely die if you were going fast enough.

In conclusion, simply because the downsides outweigh the upsides. You should not be able to go on your phone while driving. Because of the distraction that it causes. ANd its impact on our awareness of our surroundings while driving. It's a safety risk and for the most part only has downsides. From hitting cars to hitting pedestrians, the risk is not worth it as it puts many lives at risk.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Phone usage grew quickly after the first two decades, and now over half of the world population owns a phone. Considering cell phones haven't been around for a long time, they have become a main part of our lives, and we rely on them for simple daily activities. The growth of cell phones could be from how easy it is to reach someone within seconds no matter their location. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: phone calls, sending text messages, emails, surfing the internet, and performing other tasks. But unfortunately, many of these daily activities also occur while a person is driving. As a result, there's an increase in accidents and fatalities because of the use of cell phones while driving. Cell phone usage while driving should be banned because it's a distraction, causes erratic and aggressive driving, and is the main cause of accidents.

While driving, total concentration and procedures are needed, and using a cell phone compromises the focus needed. When driving both hands should be kept on the steering wheel because it has been proving more effective. However, when you're on the phone you don't have both hard on the wheel. Even though some people use bluetooth headsets it still affects your attentiveness. Using a phone while driving causes drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel, their minds off the road and the surrounding situation, and take their eyes off the road.

When driving you shouldn't have any distractions such as cell phones, because they can cause a change to your driving pattern.

Because using a cell phone while driving is such a distraction, it can cause the driver to drive erratically. Being on the phone may cause the driver to fail to give the right signals, miss road signs, or respond slowly to situations. These patterns can be very treacherous to others driving and pedestrians. Cell phones can also change the drivers' behavior depending on the conversation or what the driver is doing on their phone. Drivers experiencing emotional or stressful conversations may behave more aggressively, possibly causing road rage and accidents. Even though most drivers believe they can multitask, many of them are getting distracted and their driving patterns are changing, causing them to have accidents.

Many accidents are caused by those using their cell phones while driving. There are about 1.6 million accidents caused by phone use, which is roughly six times more than accidents caused by drunk drivers.

Cell phones have quickly spread and became a major part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything, making us rely on them heavily. However, we are using phones while driving, which is causing an increase in accidents. Phones cause distractions and could change the behavior of the driver.

Some say they don't like this new law because it means they can't check their phones for emergencies. The law didn't say you couldn't keep it in the car or their glove department. So basically, that problem is solved. I think this Law is fine how it is and that it is a good law to cut down on cell phones and driving. People shouldn't be able to see their phone while driving. It should be somewhere in the car out of their eyesight. That way they won't be tempted to text while driving.

Texting and driving can get both people killed that crash into each other.

You could be driving and doing nothing wrong while another person is texting and driving not paying attention to the road and they could end up ending your life.

Texting is not the only problem with having a cell phone on you when you are in a car. Some people say they use their phone for navigation. This could also be a distraction. Many phone companies have touched down on this problem. In fact, the newer model phones now can speak the directions to you while you're driving. That way you won't have to look down at your phone.

People often like to bring up that sometimes they get important calls while driving. There's also a solution to this problem to. When you are receiving a call, you can pull over to the nearest stop and then receive the call. People then like to ask what if you are on the interstate. There is no law that says you can't pull over to the side and make or receive the phone call.

With vehicles it was somewhat the same deal, Find an easier, and quicker way to travel. Individually both inventions are credible to society, but is it safe for drivers to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? No, it is not safe in any way for people to use phones while driving.

In order to use a phone your eyes, hands and attention must be on the device, looking through apps or sending messages can be very distracting while driving. Distracted is one thing one should not be when operating a vehicle, distracted driving can result in an accident which can either seriously injure or kill someone. When it comes to accidents caused by distracted driving the numbers are higher amongst teen drivers. In this generation teens are addicted to their phones and social media, it is harder for them to find a disconnect even when driving. ""In 2017, nearly 40 percent of high school students reported texting or emailing while driving."" ""Distracted driving is reported to be responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes.

These statistics further prove how a cellular device should not be in use while driving a vehicle.

While using a phone when driving is extremely dangerous there is an alternative to using a device while operating a vehicle, bluetooth. Some people who have business related occupations may already have a bluetooth earpiece, but car manufacturers are now including bluetooth systems inside their cars. This feature allows one to connect their phone to their car, so that they can easily answer the phone by clicking a button on their wheel, and the car can read out sent text messages. One can respond by using voice typing, this allows people to easily answer phone calls and text messages without having to physically take their hands off the wheel. Minimizing accidents caused by distracted driving, talking on the phone and thinking on how to respond to a message can still be distracting and remove focus from the road. Therefore, even using the Bluetooth feature can be a cause of an automobile accident.

Overall, neither phones or alternative phone systems should be used while operating a vehicle. It is too distracting and the effect of one simply answering a text or phone call could be their or another driver's life.

The first reason why you should not use a cell phone and drive is because it is inconsiderate of other drivers. When people use their cell phones on the highway or on a city road, their driving tends to become pretty lousy. Examples of this are shown in various ways such as someone pulling out in front of your vehicle, not letting you merge into an adjacent lane, the driver ahead of you slowing down to text or call, and not acknowledging other drivers and pedestrians at intersections and parking lots. When a driver slows down to text or make a phone call, they are taking their attention away from the road, which is one of the most common ways to end up in an auto crash. No text message or phone call is worth a rude action on a highway or city road much less an auto accident. It is not good to use a cell phone while driving because it can cause you to not let another car merge into a lane, pull out in front of another vehicle, slow down, and for a few other reasons too.

The next reason why it is bad to use hand-held devices and drive is because committing these actions causes more automobile crashes, as my other discussions have already indicated. Why is this? It is because using a cell phone while driving distracts the driver causing him/her to look elsewhere. Some may be attempting to dial, text, or talking on their cell phone, but nevertheless it still distracts the driver. Because of this distraction, drivers are more prone to end up in an automobile accident. Just as if a distraction might cause you to lose a point in a tennis match, a distraction on the road could cause an automobile accident. Another reason why not to use a cell phone and drive is because there are alternatives to cell phones that are less dangerous. For example, the earpiece is a device that fits on your outer ear as you might have guessed and allows you to have both hands on the steering wheel while you answer a call. With the push of a button, a call can be answered while you can still be driving safely. In conclusion, you should not use a cell phone while driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers, because it is illegal, it causes more automobile crashes, and because there are alternatives that are safer than cell phones when on the road. If you regularly answer calls or texts when you are going shopping, to work, to a friend's house, or whatever you may be doing, consider the consequences. What is more important? The text message or your life?. If you are pulled over texting and driving, you will be issued a fine. However, if you are texting and driving and you cause an accident, there may be criminal consequences for those actions that could result in jail time. Nowadays, there are many apps available to drivers to deter them from texting while driving Something very important is that many of the states have started to pass some laws that order drivers to stop texting while driving. However, we need to be sincere: none of these laws will be effective if we as a society don't understand that texting while driving could have terrible consequences, not only for us as drivers but also for other innocent people.

Is Bluetooth actually any safer? Setting up Bluetooth can be as easy as one, two, three.

I believe bluetooth is safer because you would be allowed to have hands free control over your phone. This essentially removes the problem of operating your phone while driving.

In recent years there have been many studies conducted on how texting while driving is dangerous and the negative outcomes that usually happen. I believe nobody should operate a cell phone in any capacity while driving. One reason that you shouldn't use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because you aren't considering other motorists.

You don't want to text and drive in front of them because they may start to think that's the right thing to do. Kids tend to mock behaviors that they see others doing and if the mock the texting and driving habit those type of accidents will never stop. Due to texting and driving teens are 400 percent more likely to get into an accident. Teen drivers being distracted by cell phones is the number one killer in teenage deaths. With teens being so inexperienced with driving they need a completely focused and structured driving zone so that their full attention is on the road and nothing else.

Did you know that texting and driving slows your reaction time? Researchers at Texas A&M transportation conducted a ""how your reaction time is affected"" project. The normal reaction time without any distractions was one to two seconds, when you're texting and driving the reaction time number shoots up to four or five seconds. You may think ""oh whatever four to five"" seconds isn't enough time to cause any damage"" and in reality, if you're not paying attention for one second a lot can go wrong especially behind the wheel. Finally, one accident and your insurance goes sky high. Why would you want to pay money for something this is preventable? Texting and driving is pretty easy not to do. If you feel like you absolutely can't keep your hands off the phone there are tips to help with that. One thing you could do is put It inside of the glover department so that you can't reach it. One last tip that you could so is have a passenger (if you have one) to hold your phone so you can't get to it.

Now think about it...is texting and driving worth it? All the things that could go bad if you are distracted and driving should encourage you to drive distraction free. I think in order to prevent all these accidents among teens especially is to have cars that blocks out service so that phone access is completely impossible! Now that you've read this will you change, or will you continue to make the same careless decisions? Texting and driving accident percentages can go down if we all try to stop. People are dying and getting seriously injured because of that. Today let's make a promise that we will put the phones down and travel safe!                     ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Over the last few years there have been many records of death and/or Injury from being on your phone and driving. There are many laws in place to stop this act from happening, but just like with everything else, there's no way to fully stop it. Many people have different opinions on the subject. In this essay I will be explaining the two sides; good and the bad. How dangerous is it to operate a vehicle and a phone at the same time?

Six thousand people die each year in the US due to texting and driving. Cell phone use should be prohibited why you operate any piece of machinery. Things malfunction and can go wrong with your full attention on them. Don't give any room for error. You aren't only putting yourself into danger but everyone else around you as well. Anything you do besides watching the road and focusing on your surroundings is putting your life at risk. Anything can happen in two seconds without your eyes on the road. Think about how many times you almost got into an accident due to someone else not paying attention, but you're fine because you were. A phone takes that away from you.

There's not a good side to texting and driving. They've made many alternatives to not having to touch your phone while driving but still being able to operate it. We all have a virtual human on our phones who tells us directions or calls who we want based on us saying things like, ""Hey Siri."" They make phone holders for your dash, but that's sill dangerous because you shouldn't take your eyes off the road anytime the vehicle is in motion. Everyone uses a cellphone while driving because they feel like they must be in a rush to get a text sent or etc. It isn't safe to be distracted by anything while driving let alone something so addicting already like a cellphone.

In conclusion, trying to operate a vehicle and a phone at the same time is dangerous and life threatening. It takes one second to not be in an accident because you were too late. Just one second could change so many lives, and impact many more. You should stay focused on the road and arriving to your destination. That one missed phone call can be returned, and if not pull over somewhere safely and stay parked until you're done messing with your phone. Don't operate a phone and drive. The road requires your full attention.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

What would we do without the latest technologies in our daily life? We use computers for work and in school, we use cell phones to access apps and do research. At home, we use microwaves to heat up food and landlines have been replaced by cell phones as the main phone of many people. In our daily lives we use cell phones to text, look up boarding passes, check flights and make phone calls. More and more, people are using technology, including cell phones, as an important part of their lives. As more and more people become dependent on the use of cell phones, some of the time they are being used may be in a car, while driving. Is the cell phone more helpful or hurtful when they are used by drivers in a car?

While a small minority of people do not have cell phones, the prevalence of cell phone ownership and use has increased. ""Cell phone usage is becoming a mounting issue in the United States with 91% of Americans (97% of people between 18-24) owning cell phones and using them for texting, calling and communicating for personal, work and school in daily life."" (""Cell Phone ownership""). Cell phones are so in trend with their convenience and popularity they seem to be increasing in numbers and not decreasing. ""Eighty-one percent of Americans own smart phones up from 35% in the 2011"" (""Mobile Fact Sheet""). It seems that more people are becoming dependent on them, despite the potential risks. For teens, texting has become more popular as making a phone call. Starting in the year 2001, State governments have started creating laws to limit cell phone usage by individuals driving in cars, as risks arise.

Despite the controversy there are benefits of cellphones especially for teenage students, who are now using new technologies during the school year. Cell phones are becoming more popular in school as a learning aid. ""In a recent poll 94% of students use their phones in class for learning"" (""Cell phone use""). The Majority of U.S. students are now relying on cell phones to get their school assignments and homework done. Since these teens have the cell phones in their possession, as they drive to school, they may be tempted to use them, both texting and calling, while they are behind the wheel. The benefits of this immediate communication with others and the convenience it creates, it may be outweighed by the risks and dangers of this usage.

In contrast to the benefits for cell phones, the dangers of distracted driving are real. Starting in the 2000's, States have started to restrict the use of cell phones while driving mainly due to the incidence of car accidents involving a driver using their cell phone. The fatalities do not just include the driver, but also the passengers and other victims. ""Twenty states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico have hand-held cell phone use bans and thirty-eight states ban all cell phone use by novice and teen drivers"" (""Distracted Driving Laws""). ""Cell phone use while driving causing distracted driving has been linked to automobile accidents and fatalities"". (""Distracted Driving Laws""). The increase in accidents associated with cell phones is still controversial and there are arguments on both sides as far as the causes.

Some surprising emerging data shows a benefit of cell phones is their use in emergency situations. ""Patients are more likely to survive when emergency services are called from a cell phone rather than a landline"" (Weinlich). ""It is associated with improved mortality rates at the scene of medical events"" (""Mobile Phones proven""). Drivers may use their cell phones while driving to report an emergency. As more people continue to use cell phones more people may be able to helped and potentially saved in emergencies. Is the risk of distracted driving worth the potential benefit of helping someone in distress?

In addition to the risk associated with distracted driving there is another health risk associated with phone use. ""Cell phones give off a form of energy known as radiofrequency (RF) waves."" (""Cell Phone Safety""). And while this risk occurs whether the person is driving or not, it would be another reason for the driver to adhere to the handsfree laws. The concern has been a link that shows increasing risk of brain tumors of the head and neck while the driver holds the phone to the face (Creagan). ""The evidence is mixed though and there is limited evidence linking cell phone radiation to human cancer"" (""Electromagnetic Fields""). The mounting risks and seeming benefits for the driver are numerous and careful consideration must be used when considering using a cell phone while driving.

Overall phones have changed society for the better and for the worse. Since their introduction, the cell phone has significantly changed how people talk and has increased the convenience of personal communication. But the life-changing benefits of the cell phone come with many controversial risks. The negative effects of deaths from distracted driving along with other health concerns cannot be overlooked. Many distracted cell phone driver accidents occur with young teenage drivers actively using their cellphones while operating a motor vehicle. While these events may make the evening news, they will never bring back the special life of that driver, the passengers or others that may have been hurt or killed. More private and government agencies need to further expose the dangerous links of driver cell phone use to human health. There is a great need to further educate the public of these risks. Having these agencies along with Hollywood, TV and social media, where images and messaging catch teens attention, could positively educate drivers and shape what safe cellphone usage looks like. This positive action may ultimately save lives.

It has always been a big concern on being on your phone, while driving. There are many bad outcomes from being on your phone while driving. You could possibly swerve off the road, crash into someone, or zoning out and not knowing what is going to happen next. Many people repeatedly still be on their phones while driving, while knowing what the outcome could lead to, and still not caring. Phones are a huge distraction while driving and no one seems to care what happens after.

Being on your phone while driving is not something that should be normalized. It can lead to one major problem, which is having an accident. When it comes to car crashes, and the cause of the crash is someone being distracted, is never a good look on the driver. Many people can lose their life, they can come out alive from the accident, but can still be traumatized to the point where they do not want, to ever get in a car again. 26% of most accidents are from texting while driving.

Another cause of being on the phone while driving, is a possibility of swerving off the road. No one ever wants to experience being a car alone, and next thing you know your trying to get back control of your car, from not being focused on the road. The outcome can be bad to the point where, you do not know where you are, may have lost your phone, and have no way of getting out because you are stuck. There have been nearly 390,00 accidents, caused from swerving while being on your phone. This could all be avoided if you just stay of your phone.

Finally, you could zone out, while on the road. When you are driving, your focus is the road. Zoning out while driving, and your phone can be a pretty ugly situation. You could possibly be intoxicated, and not knowing why, you on your phone and get carried away and zone out for a quick second, and next thing you know. You are in an accident. There are many ways to get an accident, but the common reason of accidents happening, is drivers being on their phone.

To sum up this unreasonable situation, do not be on your phone while driving. The outcomes can be you zoning out, which leads to an accident, swerving off the road, while being on the phone, and mainly just crashing into someone, while being on your phone. Whatever it is, it can wait, just for a good 10 minutes. It is never worth the risk of getting hurt.                        ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

The use of phones and cars serve many purposes such as communicating with others, playing games, and using the many different internet based features.

We use cars as a means of travel, others to modify and race, and make them look cool. In every day jobs like firefighters and police use cars to patrol neighborhoods and to travel to the location they are called to. For delivery like packages and food we use cars and phones for most of the things we do in modern society. But get in some accidents or cause accidents with cars and we get hurt because of these accidents physically and financially but they can be avoided taking precautions like insurance and driving safe and keep your car maintenance high or good . According to https://www. insurancejournal. com/news/national/2018/08/24/499107. htm

The death toll for 2018 is 18,720 and an additional 2.1 million people who have sustained serious injuries due to car accidents in the first six months of 2018. Texting and driving should not be aloud because it can kill people and its bad that it happens . People have lost their lives because of a text which is sad one moment your here next you're not you could be driving one day and text while driving with a blink of an eye you could be gone .

The laws and punishment the law should be to not be on your cell phone while driving or if you're are on it make sure it's on speaker phone or have somebody text on your phone to whoever. The punishment should be a fine or community service but no serious punishment because it was an accident . But if it was on purpose then should have jail time why because it was done intentionally and they knew exactly what they were doing . It's a accident most of the time but the point is that it happens which we can't prevent car accidents but we can decrease them.

And for coverage for your car like insurance cost sometimes a lot of money it really depends on the insurance company and the benefits from that company . but it's worth it and don't text and drive it may cost you a lot of money or your life it's important to keep your eyes on the road at all times and to pay attention from crashing or getting crashed into .We have highway patrol and police with speeding guns to prevent crashes people cause by speeding or not paying attention .

Having a cellphone when driving is dangerous. Dangerous for you and the people around you. Most people lives are taken each and every day by a simple act called ""Careless Driving"". The act of texting and has come across from this new generation.

Statistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone and at least 341000 involved text messaging.

Texting while driving is worse than talking while driving. Talking while driving isn't as bad because your focused on the road but at the same time, you're trying to listen to someone else's conversation, and you try to get over and you think your focused and you're not then boom a car crash. Texting while driving as to be the worst thing ever and causes more effects and injuries. Texting while driving you have look down at your phone instead of it being in front of you the boom when you rise back up to see the road, you're on the other side of or about to hit a car.

Statistics show that 37,461 lives were lost on U.S roads in 2016 an increase of 5.6% from 2015 until 2017. Also, in 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 391,000 injured in crashes involving distracted drivers. So, it seems that texting while driving is way dangerous then talking while driving its many proving facts you get kilt faster while texting and driving.

I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing a raise to people's insurance, and it is causing concern to people's health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation. Despite of the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that handsfree set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. The National Safety Council reports that cellphone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year caused by from by texting. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving while using a cell phone while drunk and driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.

Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accidents and many auto insurance websites warn of distracted driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy.

Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people

Many people walk to their destinations to meet friends or to even go to work if it's close. They should be able to cross the road without having to worry about a car plowing them down. If someone is driving and they're focusing on their phone, they wouldn't be able to see the person walking across the street. A phone shouldn't have that much of a hold over you. A lot of deaths happen just from people not diverting all of their attention to the road. They're too busy typing on their phones, trying to send a message that could have waited until they reached where they were going.

Drivers are distracted while they're on the phone meaning they aren't paying any mind to the cars behind or in front of them. Accidents can happen anywhere at any time of the day. There are so many car crashes that happen on the highways and most of the time, it is because the driver was on their phone. People can get injured or worse, they can die from the sudden impact of the crash. Therefore, drivers should keep their eyes and mind on the road to prevent the death of injury of someone else.

Phones are the biggest distraction to drivers as of today and they should be banned from use when driving. People believe that there are more drunk driving deaths than there are driving and texting deaths. Eventually, a law will have to be made to prevent driving while on you are on your phone.

Two seconds is all it takes to risk the lives of the driver and people on the road. For the driver to take their eyes and brain off the task of driving is highly dangerous. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because they are putting their safety and others endangered and risk rising insurance prices.

Multitasking and using a mobile phone while behind the wheel is distracting to the driver, which can be life-threatening. Distractive driving effects all drivers equally whether the driver is talking on the phone, texting, on social media, or taking photos. For example, Emily wrote, ""Unfortunately, more and more people are making the dangerous decision to text and drive, which causes 1.6 million crashes and almost 400,000 injuries per year, according to The National Safety Council-that's one out of every four car accidents!""(Delbridge) In other words, studies found that operating a mobile phone while driving slows the reaction time of the driver, and restricts a driver's perception skills; which increases the likelihoods of being involved in a collision. Distractive driving is equivalent to drunk driving because the behavior causes negative consequences that are life threatening. Especially for inexperience drivers and those who lack skill. To add on, the ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia"" states, ""In 2017 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States."" (Distracted Driving Research)

All driver should know that if they cause an accident because of risky behavior, their car insurance rate will certainly increase. It is important to know because the bad behavior of distractive driving can have an impact on other drivers too. For instance, Emily's article states, ""Because of this, car accident rates have risen over 14 percent since 2014. Not only does this make driving more dangerous for everyone, but it also contributes to increased car insurance premiums for everyone."" (Delbridge) The car insurance premiums are established by many different components, including the drivers' neighborhood, age, distance of commute, driving history, and the behavior of other drivers. The last category is why texting and driving effects everyone. Those who tend to use their cellphone while driving is the reason that the annual U.S. traffic fatalities are rise with insurance claims.

Drivers should not use their mobile phone in any way while operating any motorize vehicle. If there is any need to use the cellphone for emergencies, the GPS, or music, Please, pullover or do it before you start to proceed driving.

In conclusion drivers need to drive and only drive because whatever it is that is distracting is not worth people's lives.

In this day and age you could not go anywhere without seeing a cell phone. It is obvious that they are a very important part of our society today. However a big problem and debate that everyone has is whether or not they should be aloud for use while driving. They can take your focus off of the task at hand which could be dangerous. However I believe that they should be allowed for use while driving.

In the car, a cell phone can be very useful. One big thing it is used for is maps. You can use your cell phone to look up your destination. Without the use of your maps you could get lost around town. Or stuck somewhere that you do not want to be. This could see to be dangerous so your cell phone could help you.

Another reason I personally believe they should be used is for music. I do not believe I could find many people to agree with me on this one if I am being honest. However, the music is very important to some people and it can help concentration while driving. It can keep you awake if you are tired. I think it is safe, as long as you just shuffle a playlist and do not stay looking at your phone to change songs.

Cell phones all around can be very helpful when it comes to driving. They can help your focus with music so you're not falling asleep behind the wheel. They can also help you not get lost in the middle of nowhere. So as long as you are safe and aware I think cell phones can be beneficial to driving.       ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

People driving while looking at their phones has become an epidemic and is a big cause of a lot of accident. Primarily involving teens who are so distracted by their phones that they are not paying any attention to the road. With the growing number of car accidents happening, they have put into place the hands-free law so that it is now illegal to be on your phone while operating a vehicle.

If you are driving while driving a vehicle, there is no good excuse for using your phone because anything that is on your phone can wait till after you're are done driving and the car is in park and everyone is safe and not in danger. Looking away from the road for even just 2 seconds can be the difference between life and death because one moment the roads might be clear and the next you could be rolled over trapped in your car.

When you are on your phone while driving, you are not only putting your life in danger but the lives of everyone around you on the road and possibly even pedestrians on the side of the roads.

On the other hand, more people could say it causes serious problems that have serious consequences as in trouble with the law and serious injuries or maybe even death and it is just a bad habit all around. depending on what you are doing and where there are many pros yet many cons to being on your phone while driving. Honestly though, I believe that people shouldn't use their phones while driving because it has more cons than pros.

Being on the phone while driving has many reasons. Maybe you have to communicate to someone because its urgent and you don't have the time to wait till you're done driving. Sometimes you are talking to someone over the phone or through text because you find it more convenient and private in your own car. Or maybe you just feel like scrolling through social media because you're bored. It might save time if your running late to places and it might be easy for people. They might think the accidents could never happen to them because they are too good of drivers.

The truth is that If you think texting in an emergency situation is ok but it will end up causing another problem on top of what's going on if you get into an accident just because you needed to make the call or send the message for an emergency.

Each year over 330,000 accidents caused by texting while driving lead to severe injuries according to ""Spivey law firm. com"".

about 9 people are killed every day and over 1,000 injured because of distracted drivers on their phones. Texting while driving is the leading cause of teen deaths in these past years. ""DMV.org"" can prove all of my statements and statistics to be true.

Texting while driving also has legal repercussions, in 47 states out of the 50 it is illegal to text and drive. you can get fined for about $125 for just your first offence. If you don't think paying that much for one ticket is far well also note that because of that you will have an increase in insurance payments. You can also get your license suspended and won't be able to even drive till they give it back. In some cases, you can even end up in prison for it. Is sending a meme worth possible jail time? It is best to just break the bad habit. It will make you drive better because no distractions and you don't have to worry about the cops pulling you over or anything like that. It will leave you more relaxed at the end of the day.

Being on your phone while driving is done all the time and can't be completely stopped but it should honestly be stopped all together. The risk and the problems are way more and way worse than the benefits of using it. It ends up getting you in trouble, having to pay fines and can cause serious sometimes fatal consequences. It is best to just put the phone down or just use a hands free phone instead. It will save lives.                      ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

People should not be able to use their cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It is dangerous and illegal to text while driving. Everyday people die in car accidents, because they use cell phones while driving. People who use cell phones while driving are putting themselves and other people in danger; therefore, they are likely to get hurt. Drivers that are distracted by cellphones are likely to not pay attention to the road or be aware what is happening on the road. Three reasons people should not use their phones while driving is that they cause distractions, accidents, and injuries.

People should not use their phones while driving because they cause distractions. People can easily get distracted by being on the phone with someone while driving. Some distractions are interruptions and entertainment by engaging in talking to someone outside your car and not paying attention to the other people or vehicles around you. Drivers should always pay attention to the road, because it is uncertain what might happen particularly, if the driver is not being careful while driving. In this case, they are more likely to have a crash.

Another reason people should not use their phones while driving, is because accidents happen when drivers do not focus on their surrounding. Operating a phone while driving is equal to; talking to people in your vehicle, or tampering with the radio instead of paying attention to the road, in regards to driving hazards. Some drivers that use cell phones while driving, cause accidents; therefore, they end up have to face serious consequences.

Finally, drivers should not use phones while driving because it can cause injuries. People can suffer pain and be all bruised up, because of the irresponsible driver not paying attention to the road. In addition, some injuries sustained as a result of cellphone use while driving, results in death. Some injuries due to the use of cellphones while driving can cause victims to have internal bleeding, skull fractures, or head, brain, neck, back injuries, and so on. In order to prevent injuries, the driver of the car should turn their phone off at all times while driving. When the driver gets to their destination, then they can resume using their phones. People should only use their phone before or after driving.

People should not use their phones while driving because they cause distractions, accidents, and injuries. Cellphones use while driving can greatly increase the risk of having an accident. Drivers that drive while not paying attention, are putting others' lives at risk and that is selfish. While driving, people should look out for signs and other things like animals and people. If someone calls the driver, then the driver can ask the person beside them to answer it.

Eliminating cellphones is the best way to save people lives.            ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8
1D35A6980E7F,"When it comes to driving on the road, the use of a phone is the number one leading cause to car accidents. While reading and texting is prohibited when driving, phones tend to be a reliable resource which helps improve our daily life.

Phones help us in many ways when it comes to driving. They help navigate us in unknown areas, and it is a great form of contact in case of emergencies. Although it tends to be distracting, technology has advanced that we can have our eyes on the road while communicating with others.

Over the years technology has evolved rapidly so that it could make life easier for us, such as bluetooth. Bluetooth is a setting on a smart device like a phone, where you can connect wirelessly with another piece of hardware, like headphones. So, if someone tries to call you while driving, all you have to do is press the button on your headphones, and you will have the ability to call, or hang up the phone.

Phones can be a great use of navigation. With sources like Google maps, it has replaced all normal paper maps for when it's time to enter a new area. Not only were the original maps were a disturbance to drivers, but your phone can literally tell you how, when, and where to take you. Whether it is warning you about construction, or when to turn left or right, your phone is there to help for this uncanny situation.

Communication is very important in this day in age. So if you were scheduled for an appointment but you are late due to traffic or for an emergency situation, you can use your phone during that situation and explain why you need to reschedule. Not only that, but if you arrive at a destination, but having trouble finding a person you need to pick up, you can just give them a call, and tell them to start heading outside.

Texting while driving is a really problematic situation when it comes to acquiring a vehicle. It will lead you to bad injuries, or even death. But if a driver uses these ideas and guideline while driving, phones would not be a controversial topic that it is now. Drive smarter, and have good safety when it comes to driving.

Drivers Shouldnt use cellphones while driving. Using cellphones while driving is very dangerous and is taking the lives of many innocent people also. Driving while using phones is becoming very common, the reason why states are coming up with new laws. Drivers should not be able to use cellphones while driving because it's a big distraction and is a big reason why people get into car accidents everyday.

Using cellphones while driving is a big distraction for a lot of different reasons. One reason why people shouldn't use their phone is because they lose focus of where they are going. I've been in a car before with somebody that was on their phone and we almost went off the road. Another reason is because you're not only putting your life in danger but everybody else that's driving around you. People have told me about accidents they have been in and they got hit by somebody that wasn't paying attention. It's easier to drive when you're off your phone. You don't have to worry about who texted or call you just focusing on the road. As long as people keep using their phones while driving accidents are going to keep increasing. A crash happens within an average of three seconds after a driver is distracted. We don't need to use our phones while driving. It's the quickest distraction while driving and it only takes 3 seconds to get distracted by a text or call and you get seriously injured.

People should not be able to use cellphones while driving because they use it for the wrong reasons while driving. Some people might say they need to use their phone because they need their GPS or if they get into an accident they need to make a call, But there are GPS's that have voices that speak the directions out loud. For emergencies people can easily pull over and make that call. Some also might say music but there are radios in the car. Answering a phone call while driving is also very dangerous. If the call that you answered to is very argumentative your anger could show in your driving. Using your phone while driving is almost worse than drinking and driving and is a proven fact. Using your phone while driving is second on the list for deaths while driving. With all this being said, Drivers should not be able to use their cellphones because it's a distraction and does not lead to anything good.

If you look at recent studies, you'll see that vehicular accidents have gone down in the last couple of years due to no strict ""no texting while driving"" laws. The reason for this is because once you get rid of the distracting handheld screen, your proficiency increases. Drivers that's always distracted by a mobile device could cause a road rage or even a big accident to the public. It isn't caring is could be highly dangerous for you and for the people around you, including the environment. This could also increase every chance of you getting pulled over by the cops if you're unlucky.

A driver's attention should solely be on the road. Their focus is already easily split by passengers, and even so with the recreational use of cellular devices. To drive, is to invite danger and risk into your life tenfold. Apparatuses like phone stands on bluetooth functionality are both proper substitutes that reduce the risk and danger of using your cell phone while driving. All in all, unless the proper measures are taken, cellular devices shouldnt be used while driving.

To say that there is a time devices should be used, maybe should be only for gps for navigation. Other than that Devices in a hand of a driver should be prohibited and forced to drive safely to their desired destination harm free. Getting caught being on a device while driving can be very treacherous, being pulled over can result in multiple tickets and will lower your credit score and that isn't so good. That goes to say driving comes with many responsibilities.

That one second where you think it is safe to pull out your phone , can be that one second later you're in the hospital. Driving can lead to serious injuries driver of any should not take focus off the road to take part in activity that doesn't have to do with what's in front of them. Studies shows 1,2 million people die every year in car crashes between the ages 15-44. So while driving take your mind of the device and start driving right, always remember that a phone will go nowhere but a life will.

Reasoning on no devices while driving is part of the law, and should be obeyed by any means.

Obviously taking a call while driving or answering a text could be severe for you and either for others that's on the road. The awareness of you not focusing on the road can lead to jail time as well, texting and driving is illegal and if your record is bad you may go to jail for such a little thing that can cause a big problem. People may cherish their phones like their life may depend on it but not focusing can put someone else's life in grave danger/                                                                     ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6
4000B8222A07,"Do you think cellphones should be used while driving? Using your phone is the top ten ways of accidents. I don't think you should use your cell phone while driving because it is very dangerous to you and other cars. You can look down for 10-15 seconds then look ""BOOM"" it's a crash. That should be one of the least ways you want to die even though it's not always your fault.

Using a cell phone is a big distraction, not only to you but to others to. Everyone has to pay attention to the road just like you will have to. It can cause you to swerve; stop on brakes to hard, not pay attention to your surroundings, and last but you least it will cause a wreck. You can put others in dangers from your use to the road.

Having 4 mirrors in total is the reason for a car, without mirrors you will be driving and have nothing to look forward to and also backwards. Looking forward is the way to go because if you keep looking at what's beside you and behind you will cause a lot of commotion in traffic. If that can cause commotion imagine what looking down at your cell phone can do and what trouble it can put you in.

Explaining all this to the police is a big mess when the situation can be resolved by just focusing on the road and what's in front of you. More importantly is your life and you staying alive. If you need your GPS to get somewhere its best you buy a phone holder to hold the phone up on your window or just buy a GPS from a nearby store.

In conclusion, stay off your phone! It's a trend now not only to you but to the whole world. It's impossible to do 2 things at one time while you control a steering wheel. You can take innocent lives fin a matter of seconds for a message or phone call that could have waited.

So in my honest opinion humans shouldn't be using cells phones when they are driving because it could cause a big accident and can even risk taking their own life. Many people drive and text and their so entertain with their phone that they don't keep up with the road and sometimes lose control of the wheel.

Not only do people use their phone but they wonder off to space or some are too busy looking at cars or doing their makeup. So it is wrong to use your phone while you in the car driving it can do major stuff you can even get stopped by the police by texting and driving. People should be more careful on driving. You might not sometimes take your own life but you can take other people life by doing a major crash. So people who are so addict with their phones shouldn't be driving for many reasons. And should let someone else drive.

Like phones can ruined so much in society and can cause a lot of damage. So I am very against on using phones while driving. It's like most of the drivers I seen are on their phone and don't see when a green light or red is on or when there's stop texting and paying attention to the road or you just don't care signs or any other kind of signs. So it's either you save your life by not driving and keep having your eyes off the road and do a major impact and crash.

In conclusion, overall driving and texting is bad. So yes, in my opinion I think you should save your calls and messages for later and pay attention to the road so you can get safely to your destination and be glad nothing happened on the road because anything can happen in a heartbeat.

Today, the majority of people own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Many debate on whether people should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Over time, the usage of cell phones has increased drastically. Fatal accidents cause an unwanted feeling in the end. Using your cell phone while operating a vehicle puts other drivers in harm's way. This can be prevented with the simple creation of car gadgets or simply putting your phone on do not disturb or just shut it off.

In my opinion, phone usage in any capacity of moving vehicles should be prohibited. A one minute text or even just being on your phone is not worth your life or anyone else's. According to ""Bran Law Firm"", Almost 200,000 people die from fatal injuries every year. This is equivalent to about one person every three minutes. National averages report about 37,000 crash-related fatalities every year. This breaks down to about 101 deaths per day in the United States. When you are driving a vehicle your main goal is to focus on the roads, and everything going on around you.

Many accidents in America are caused by teens and bad drivers. Amongst accidents, an average of nine teens ages 16-19 are killed every day from motor vehicle injuries. 2,739 drivers ages 15-20 are killed and an additional 228,000 are injured in crashes. A total of 4,054 teens between the ages of 13-19 die in car accidents. 81% of teens killed in car accidents are passengers. There are many ways to prevent Teen accidents or accidents in general. Enrolling in driving school, it creates great practice from someone who has amazing driving skills. Don't ever drive drowsy, being sleepy can impair their judgment, vision, hand-eye coordination and reaction times as much as alcohol and drugs. A study by AAA and the National Sleep Foundation found that individuals (regardless of age) who've slept two hours or less within 24 hours shouldn't be driving at all, and four or five hours of sleep in 24 hours will still leave drivers ""substantially impaired.""

Today there are many gadgets that can help the decrease in accidents. On Instamotor it discusses 5 best gadgets to comply with hand-free driving. One gadget is ""Scosche Magic Mount"". These very inexpensive mounts are available in a variety of attachment methods, from adhesive dash mounts to windshield suction cups, to adjustable arm mounts, and more. The best part of the Magic Mount is that it uses strong magnets to securely hold any phone to its surface. We've road-tested these mounts ourselves over thousands of miles and find them to be plenty secure even over rough roads. Despite the firm grip, the Magic Mount is typically small and unobtrusive, so it won't look like a small robot is trying to steal your car when it's not in use.

Another useful gadget is called the ""Motorola Roadster Pro In-Car Speakerphone"". If you really don't like the idea of having to pull your phone out of your pocket or purse every time you get into the car to secure it to your dash or windshield, however, and you don't have Bluetooth hands-free calling integrated into your car's audio system, there is another class of gadgets that will serve you well: the two-way Bluetooth in-car speakerphone. These devices typically clip to your sun visor, though some mount to other locations, and act as a traditional office speakerphone, except that they're linked to your cell by Bluetooth, and they're in your car. This means even cars without integrated Bluetooth can have the comfort and convenience of hands-free calling without ever touching your phone at all.

To conclude, always pay attention to the road and do not use your cell phone. If you do so try having something that can easily attach to the glass window especially if its a phone call, try putting your phone on do not disturb next time you enter your car, and always remember that a text that can be sent in seconds it not worth death. How do you think you would be able to drive a car, focus on the roads, and still be able to use your phone         ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Texting while driving is one of the worrying trends in the society, both teenagers and adults have developed a habit of using cell phones while driving. Texting while driving causes distraction and increases their chance of getting involved in car accidents. Such concerns have been raised by various government authorities, in trying to prevent such occurrence new laws have been enacted making cell phones use in cars illegal. However, not many people follow these laws, most people text and drive, assuming they can pay attention to other cars. Texting while driving is dangerous for many reasons.

Cell phone use while driving is the major cause of fatal accident, leaving to deaths. Despite these consequences, people are still fixated on their phones that are dangerous to not only the driver but also to other road users. According to the recent road statistics, more than 22 percent of fatal road accidents are caused by teenagers using their cellphones while driving. Also the distraction of the roads is cause by teenagers who have confidence that they can text or be on the phone while driving. Over more than 5,000 people have died last year due to texting; these accidents are mostly caused by young adults of the age 21 and under.

Furthermore, currently there are only 35 states the US have completely banned texting for all its road users, but this isn't enough to stop the problem. Laws that were banning texting while driving will save many peoples' lives. With it being that more than 5,000 people died in the last year caused by distracted drivers. It's very important that the government should take stricter action to try to decrease the deaths caused by theses distracted drivers. It is necessary for the government to enact unifying laws and stricter punishments for those who text while driving.

On the other hand, these news laws need to ban texting while driving for everyone not just for young adults, because it has similar effects on everyone who does it. There should be objection to laws for texting while driving. I feel as if each states needs to have similar laws against texting while driving. For example. Massachusetts laws on texting should be a role model for all of the other states. Massachusetts has the strictest laws on road safety. Punishment for those found texting while driving should be so stiffened to push people to dig deeper into their pockets to pay more. The fine alone is enough; stricter regulations should include license suspension to make people keep off their phones while driving.

In a nutshell, despite the laws forbidding texting while driving, many people still feel as if they have the right to text & drive. However, I feel everyone has the responsibility to put the phone down and keep your eyes on the road and drive safely. I strongly agree that texting and driving is the most dangerous thing drivers can do on the road and people are injuring innocent people that could have been a very per cautious and they lose lives every day because of careless drivers. Texting and driving is one of the most dangerous things on the road today due to all of this technology, and they will not stop making this technology just because people are getting in accidents stop the text stop the wrecks.

A lot of people get into accidents and some leads to death just because your texting or doing other things on your phone. We all know that cellphones can be really distracting but putting them away can save a lot of lives. Not having your phone out is the same as not having accidents.

One reason why you should not have cell phones is because a lot things can happen which is bad. For example You can be arguing with somebody on the phone and not see that the light turned red and keep going and a truck come and hit you. Arguing while texting can get you into a really bad situation also. While texting you will take your eyes off the road and just like that somebody can cross the street or you can run into something. If the call or text is urgent just pull the car over so you can reply or answer and nobody gets hurt.

Cell Phones are really distractive in way that you think you can drive and text but really you are in a bad crash. Your brain can tell you to do one thing at a time and when you try and do both, you panic and that can cause a crash. Both driving and texting needs concentrations so when you try to focus on both your mind gets overwhelmed and you crash. Once you get in the car just put the phone away and out of sight. Focusing on the road is the main key on the road than texting.

Texting while driving is very dangerous. You need your hands for texting so that requires you to take your hand of the wheel and the car can not be controlled. Not having a controlled car can lead to accidents. Being distracted is the main point by how dangerous texting and driving is. Texting and driving is so dangerous that is way more severe than a drunk driver.

Finally, with proven facts, texting and driving is the most dangerous thing to do. There is so many lives getting costed just so you can send a message.

I also think that there should be a law to completely band cellphone usage while driving. Cell phones are a big distraction while driving because many want to answer a text or a call right then and then they'll lose focus on driving. Drivers should be alert, paying attention to the road to prevent an accident from occurring. If drivers would keep their phones out of their hands while controlling a vehicle it would be fewer car accidents. Many new cars today have phones that are hands free and that is a lot safer than most cell phones. Despite the risks, the majority of teen drivers ignore cell phone driving restriction because they just think they are so cool and they know what they are doing until they get into a car accident. Using cell phone while driving has caused many car accident, many don't understand how distracting a phone can be. Also when texting while operating an vehicle will cause you not to look at the road. So you cant see what's coming or around you. So if you texting or talking on the phone while driving you not paying attention.

Operating a moving vehicle while driving takes your eyes off the road and many people when both hands for the phone. Many today are taught how to drive with two hands and if trying to talk while driving they take one hand off the wheel to hold the phone which makes the steering wheel feel more heavier that will cause you to lose the wheel. Also for those who try to hold the phone between their head and shoulder it puts them physically off balance and makes the phone more prone to drop. Which your mind and bodies first reaction would be to pick it up, making you take your eyes off the road. It only takes a quick second for an accident to happen. The first reason why you should not use a cell phone and drive is because it is considerate to other drivers.

Cell phones have become part of our social culture. These devices are used to send calls or texts to our friends and family members. However, we do not notice the dangers that cell phones pose when someone is driving behind the wheel.

Texting while driving has become a phenomenon in our society as we see more people dying because they do not put their phones down. We do not realize that they distract us when we drive causing so many vehicular accidents that could have been prevented in the first place. Drivers should not use their cell phones as they become a distraction on the road.

One of the main reasons that make using our cell phones while driving very dangerous is that it reduces your reaction time. Let's say that you are driving and you receive a text from a friend. You do not become aware that a car in front of you has stopped that you do not have enough time to react to hit the brakes. Limited reaction time leads to a dangerous car crash. We do not realize that looking at our phones more than your driving can lead to a fatal car accident where your life can end in the matter of seconds.

Teenagers in our society use their phones to record videos where they end up on social networks such as Snapchat. It has become a trend to record themselves driving behind the wheel without thinking about the consequences that comes with them. Constant phone use when driving has created an unsafe environment where we see young drivers becoming more addicted to their phones rather than focusing on going home safely. Recording a video for Snapchat not only endangers you , the driver, but your surroundings such as pedestrians, your fellow passengers, and other drivers. We must think more about the dangers that we create when we record a video by thinking about what could go wrong. Think about the lives that would be destroyed . This is another reason why accidents happen because many people, especially young teenagers , tend to become careless that they would prefer social media over maintaining control on the steering wheel.

How do we control our cell phone use when we are driving? We need to put our phones away and focus on the road. "" Don't text and drive"" messages seen on billboards are there to remind you and other drivers that it is not a safe using your phone while driving. Other road signs contain a "" drive home safe"" poster for this reason. We cannot risk our lives for an electronic device. We have families that are waiting for us to come home safely.

Distracted driving has become a hot topic in many states such as Georgia where we have a ""hands-free law."" It is illegal to have a cell phone when operating a motorized vehicle. We need to raise more awareness about our cell phones and driving that many posters shown in highways reminds drivers of the dangers they face. Informational commercials with drivers on their cell phones depict their lives where they show that being distracted by these hand-held devices can cause a fatal accident. And that we might not make it home safe . Not only do we have to be tough on drivers, but we have to remind them that we have families . And some of them may never see us again for not putting our phones away.

Operators who have fatal damages in a year are measured in the tens of thousands, and approximately 2.5 million are gravely hurt or forever disabled. The United States has more than 220 million licensed drivers, and they risk their lives every time they enter as a driver or passenger seat. If you're texting while operating a vehicle then you're not paying attention and that could lead to you connecting to someone leading to their death or someone getting seriously injured.

What the majority of people don't think about is the cost. People or corporations lose money because of thoughtless driving. For instance, accidents caused by cellphone usage leads to big pickup trucks or cause company trucks to drop loads on loads of equipment leaving to great money loss. This can also make a big financial deficient if the truck was hit now we have to pay for damages. This can also lead to bad news if the operator is hurt. If the goods that the driver is haling is damaged or broken that can lead to more money to replace the loss of the haul. The highest price we pay for car crashes is in the loss of human lives, nonetheless, auto industries make steady improvements in vehicle safety over the last several decades but in the year 2014, nearly 32,675 deaths were documented.

In my final judgment, I suppose we can drive safly on our roads without having accidents. Yet I do know that the nature of a human being makes mistakes throughout there lifetime and in those types of situations should be resolved in a courtroom. Furthermore, people who don't follow the law of not texting while driving should have the permits suspend, but we all know that too much of a hassle to deal with.

Many phones could be a risk when used during the road, highways, turns and hills.

The used of cell phones on the road have killed many people, it decreases their concentration and lack of driving.

In fact, Cell phone used on the car could be helpful, to take you somewhere or to look up something to eat nearby but all this actions will decrease your focus on the road, drivers should always be ready before their off in the road. It is much safer if everyone plans before leaving the house, it will improve the community. The longer the call or the more emotional the conversation is, the more the driver concentrates more on the call rather than on her or his own driving. There is a risk to every second you take your eyes off because you'll never know what will happen.

Car crashes happen very often around the world, injuries and also death. Drivers should drive with two hands to have more control to the vehicle.

Operating a cell while driving has always been a problem nationwide .The amount of people who think its ok operate a cell phone is ridiculous. The national safety council reports that 1.6 million crashes happen each year because of a person using their cell phone while driving. Most of the reasons why there is so many crashes is people can't wait to text their friends and end up getting distracted. Which leads them to hitting something or someone it's just sad that people can't wait to text their friends.

The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example increases your risk of crashing. Even at 60km/h, your car is travelling at more than 16 meters per second, so in those few moments your eyes were on a screen rather than the road you moved far enough to not see a motorcycle, a pedestrian, or someone braking suddenly in front of you. Other figures suggest that someone dumb enough to text and drive at the same time is increasing their risk of dying by almost 900 per cent.

Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit, do not forget about this also. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving.

Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different thing with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of the distracted driving.

My conclusion is that every time you drive while using your cell phone. You not only put yourself in danger but you put the people around you in danger as well I rather see you live another day. We all know it's tempting sometimes to cheek if we got a message or who is calling us but that little second can change your whole life. That's why some people recommend you turn off your phone or put you phone on vibrate so that you won't be to tempted to pick up your phone. Look driving in the highways is dangers because of all the accidents that happen and by you using your cell phone makes it more dangers then it already is.

One reason situation in which drivers would need to use a cellphone is for driving directions. Another reason to use a cellphone while driving would be for an emergency situation, then last would be to report a hazardous road condition.

Nowadays people are using the new and upcoming driving apps Lyft and Uber. For a driver to know where to pick up and drop off a person who needs a ride. People also love to visit new places and state attractions. For tourists they often uses google maps or cellphone GPS. It's never a good thing to have the phone in your hand or in your cup holder while driving so that's why companies have made phone holders that are placed on the windshield of the car so that you can always keep your eyes on the road while driving to your next destination.

Another reason for use for cellphones while on the road would be for emergencies. Most people have family out of state and many parents worry about their children who attend college out of state and would love to hear from them at any chance they get. Let's take a newlywed couple for example. The husband is on his way to work while his pregnant wife is home resting next thing she knows her water breaks and is on her way to the hospital. When she reaches the hospital she calls him immediately and now he is on route to the hospital.

Lastly most cellphones are used to contact state or highway patrol to alert them about highway safety related non emergencies. Like if there was a highway/road block or a really bad traffic jam. Most of the time they call highway patrol for vehicle breakdowns/problems, accidents, hazardous material spills, or other highway hazards/problems, as well as impaired or aggressive/reckless drivers and other criminal behavior.

So having a cellphone at your fingertips isn't so bad. Talking on your cellphone while you drive can certainly lead to distraction and accidents but having a cellphone in your car can be very useful in an emergency situation. So the next time you talk on the phone be careful on how you go about it.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

So, what is you lose you job or your boyfriend/girlfriend or an interview, there is always a better job and lover, but no such thing as a life that's better than yours. Just one look can change everything. States in the United States are making laws that prevent you from having your phone in your hands, lap, or chest. While texting while driving is illegal in 47 states, its hasn't stopped some drivers from doing so. Not only are they putting their own life on the line, they risk others too. So, the next time you coming from work, late night, in your feelings, texting your ex how you want them back, blasting Marvin's Room and Jungle by Drake, just remember that you can't get your ex back when you aren't able to walk or worse deceased.

Texting while driving is a serious matter. Lives are at risk due to someone wanting to send just one letter to their friend. Since when was texting your friend more important than living to see them again. Some don't even text they just scroll on Instagram to see what's happening. If we still had flip phones and no touch screen people would just answer a call which is better but still risky because you take your focus off the road. Texts aren't gonna kill you if you don't text back, your mom will understand.

In 47 states texting while driving is illegal, but only few have made it illegal to have your phone in your hand or on you body while driving. The state of Georgia, July 4th, when they in-forced that law they racked up more that 35,000+ tickets in one day and that says a lot. If every state did the same, they would most likely accumulate one million 500 thousand tickets in one day. That's a lot of lives on the line, but people act as if they are masters of texting and driving. Little do they know.

Phones are a problem in the car. Car crashes have rocketed up dramatically since phones have been introduced. 2007 was the time the iPhone came to be and that was the beginning of something great to turn into a disaster. I read in an article that said; ""American will participate in almost 42 hours a week of seated leisure activities by 2030"".

If you don't have a chance with that girl, don't ruin somebody else's. You phone is always there, and that text might be too, plus you can always get a new phone, but you can't get a new life on earth.

Putting your phone on do not disturb or letting the person you are texting or calling know that you are about to get on the road can prevent a crash. Waiting to answer or respond to texts or notifications can wait to lose or risking your own life or someone else's is not worth it.

These numbers will only increase year by year if we don't obey laws and regulations pertaining to texting and driving. Despite these number of tragedies, drivers still continue to risk their own lives and others. Even using your phone at a stop sign or at traffic light is dangerous and it should not be done. Just taking one look down at your phone could risk you your life or theirs. We might think that looking down once would be a harmless act, but it puts a strain on attention while driving. The reason why some might text, and drive is because they might have done the harmful act before and gotten away with it and that gives them the confidence in doing it over and over again. People begin to ignore that actual risk of texting and driving and do it over and over again which could ultimately lead to something fatal and dangerous.

In most states they have placed numerous laws about texting and driving and most of them could lead the person to jail time. In the state of Georgia, we have recently passed a new hands-free law, which makes it illegal to be on your phone at all even if you are just holding it. It is even illegal to text while stopped at a traffic light or if you are stuck at traffic. If caught by law enforcement, you could be fined $50 on your first offense and one point on your driver's license. The cost and points taken off increase as you keep doing it which could lead to jail time. And if you get into an accident and it ends in a fatality it could lead to charges of murder with years of jail time.

It is time to eliminate the usage of phones while driving in order to save thousands of lives.          ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

The number of fatal crashes caused by cell phone distracted driving in 2017 was 434 (""Facts and Statistics: Distracted Driving""). The amount of fatal accidents from the use of cell phones while driving has only gotten worse through the years. Ever since cell phones have become more advanced and more popular, the danger has increased. It is hard enough to stay focused while driving but phones make that task 10 times as difficult. Even something as simple as changing the song or answering a text for a split second while driving can put yourself and others at risk.

Teens play a big part in all of this, being the most likely to use cell phones on the road. Teenagers are not as experienced drivers and think that driving is a task they can take with ease. Although driving might come easy for some, that does not give room to be distracted. I personally witness cell phones being used on the road daily. My mom and my dad both use talk-to-text while driving and my boyfriend holds his phone in one hand while driving with the other. My friend and I almost got into an accident the other day because she was using her phone. Nowadays society is far too attached to technology, especially phones. Not only are teens learning that using phones while driving is acceptable from their parents, they also think that breaking the law is nothing to stress.

In mosts states it is illegal to even have your cell phone in your hand let alone be using it or talking on the phone while driving. If the law is not enough to persuade people to stop using phones while driving, the dangers of killing people should. Close to five thousand people died due to cell phone related crashes in 2018 (Texting and Driving Statistics 2019, thezebra. com). Even if someone is not on the phone themselves, someone else on the road could be. When someone decides to use their phone while driving they are not only putting themselves at risk, they are endangering every other person on the road. If they look away from the road for even one second and become distracted, they could crash into another person. There could be children in the car that die from the crash, or a pregnant woman. Lives are constantly at stake while in the car, being distracted only makes things worse.

Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent (Cell Phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts, teendriversource. org). Teenagers just starting to drive and adults already driving should take preventative measures to be more safe on the road. They could finish a call or text before they begin driving, leave the phone alone while stopped, and put the phone on silent or do not disturb when driving. Most phones now have a driving more that will mute notifications and send a text back to inform the person they are driving. Even if someone is not driving they can still help. If they call someone who happens to be driving, they can say they will call them back later at a better time.

Society as a whole can and should be better and form good habits by not using a cell phone while driving. Distracted driving is a serious topic and the deaths need to be decreased desperately. The safety of people's lives are nothing to take lightly. Even if someone does something as simple as changing the song or answering a text, that automatically puts them and everyone around them in danger. We all need to do the right thing by following the law and give up phones while driving.

Using your phone while driving is illegal because it distracts people from the road. Driving and using your phone is very dangerous because you are taking your attention off the road. Which can increase your risk of crashing into someone or something. This is why drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving.

Using your phone while driving is very dangerous and can increase the chance of an accident jurrasticaly. In 2010 a study was shown that 26% of all crashes were related to using your phone while driving. This shows a quarter of accidents come from people who are distracted by their phones instead of paying attention to the road. Using your phone while driving can not only put the driver's life in danger but everyone around the driver too. This is just one reason why you shouldn't be able to use your phone while operating a motor vehicle.

A second reason to not use while driving is that it reduces your brain activity while driving. So even if you are using your phone and paying attention to the road your brain still doesn't work as well while driving. The brain isn't meant for multitasking and texting or holding your phone and talking to someone is a lot of work for your brain. So it slows down the brain activity you are using towards driving and puts it more towards you using your mobile device. This will reduce your reaction time and your full judgement. These are just some of the reasons why you shouldn't use your phone while driving.

Driving while using your phone is dangerous and can lead to an increase in a crash or misjudgement. Using your mobile phone while driving is illegal for a reason it is dangerous for you and everyone around you. But there will always be people who will use their phone and drive and not get hurt. But using your mobile device increases your chance to get into an accident quite a bit. Use your mobile device before and after you get out of your car not while your in it.

0E39D7B44ACD,"One of the leading causes of distracted driving is Texting and Driving. 26% of all car crashes happen while texting and driving, also texting and driving is the number one leading cause of death in teens. 31% of people in the united states that text and drive. Nine people are killed and more than 1,000 people are also injured every day due to texting and driving. More than 42% of teens admit that they text and drive. Texting and driving, makes you take your hand of the steering wheel, your eyes off the road and takes away the point of safe driving. Anything could happen with only one text message like car crashes or hitting someone or both. Teens that drive with someone else in the car could be even more distracting than texting and driving, because usually people who have more people in the car don't focus on the road and most likely won't wear a seatbelt. People usually use their phone in a car to change a music station, searching the web, updating social media and texting.

Texting and Driving has been illegal since November 1st, 2015, if caught texting and driving you could serve prison time, license suspension, fines and higher auto insurance. You could serve up to 30 days in prison for using your phone on the road. Texting and Driving is a habit and there are some apps parents could use to monitor the amount off miles, notification blocking and text and call blocking. Some phones are programmed to not allow access while driving but it doesn't mean people still can't get on their phones, usually phones have a notification and asks if you're a passenger and if you hit yes, you could still use your phone. The Newest iPhones are trying to get people to stay off their phones while driving by not allowing to let drivers access their phone. Most newer cars have a button where you could make calls through the car instead of picking up your phone to text someone.

Although people will never stop texting, I believe there is a way to minimize cell phone use while driving. By putting your phone out of reach for people to get tempted to turn on their phone and it will minimize the habit of using phones. Also by turning the phone on silent, so the person driving doesn't hear it and want to pick it up to check and see what it is. People should learn to break their habits from their phones, most people who see or hear their phone then they pick it up. While on the road, everyone wants for everyone else to drive safe so they could get to point A to point B without getting a crash by unsafe drivers, so I believe if everyone wants to remain safe and to get to their destination, they should just not use it while driving. More ways to not be distracted on the roads are keeping the radio on one station, turning their phone off while driving and driving without passengers.

66BD5DA864C8,"Cell phone use while driving is one of those hot-button issues at the moment. Everyone has a cell phone. When it goes off while they are driving whether it is a message, social media or a phone call, curiosity seems to get the best of them and they feel as if they have to look now. Using cell phones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It does not matter how good you are at multitasking, it should be forbidden and against the law entirely. Here are just a few reasons for that.

Let's start with texts, social media and any other written phone alert. To stop and read this message or update you would have to take your eyes off of the road for longer than the recommended time of the one second, it takes to check the rearview mirror. It is extremely dangerous to type or read while driving. It is a hazard to everyone on the road, so it is not just your own life you are risking.

As for making phone calls, this too should be banned. I do understand that sometimes your spouse may call needing you to stop somewhere on the way home, or you think it may be an emergency. If that is the case, then pull over to the side of the road, take the call, and then return to driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason to pick up your phone while driving your car.

Even hands-free devices that allow us to talk on the phone while driving with both hands on the wheel are still a hazard. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a; lot of its energy into the conversation. This means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction.

Whatever it is can almost always wait until you get where you are going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be as convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many teenage lives to Tweets or texts if they know their license could be taken if they do look.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

CB86EB780CF1,"No Phones Allowed While Driving

Today, many people both own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. So much so, that many have developed the tendency to do so while operating a vehicle. This current trend of behavior among drivers has caused a series of debates as to whether or not one should be allowed to use their phone while driving. Due to the many risks that come with a distracted driver. Thus, why drivers should not be allowed to operate cell phones while operating a vehicle.

While operating a vehicle, it is important for drivers to stay focused on the road. However, cell phones are one of the most common causes of distracted driving related accidents. (The Most Common Causes of Distracted Driving). According to 4 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Text and Drive by B City of Bryan, ""Five seconds is the minimal amount of time your attention is taken away from the road when you're texting and driving."" In addition, it generally only takes a driver about five seconds to travel the length of a football field when traveling around 55mph. This means that when drivers become distracted by their cell phones, they create a large window of opportunity for disaster to strike.

In most cases, people think that they can keep their eyes on the road while operating their cell phone at the same time. In contrast, drivers who allow themselves to get distracted by their cell phones increase their chances of getting into an accident, as well as putting themselves and many others life's at risk. For example, a distracted driver is, ""...23 times more likely to be in an

Hearing 2 accident,"" than a non-distracted driver. (National Highway Transportation Safety Administration). To continue, ""texting while driving is to blame for... 1,600,000 accidents per year, 330,000 injuries per year, and 11 teen deaths every day."" (National Safety Council, Harvard Center for Risk Analysis Study, Institute for Highway Safety Fatality Facts). Therefore, it is proven that a distracted automobilist is a hazard for not only themselves, but also other motorists and pedestrians.

Furthermore, due to all the costly risks that come with texting and driving, such action has been made illegal in many states. Andrei Zakhareuski, from Driving Tests, proclaims that, ""Those who are caught will be issued a citation by a policeman who will most likely be quite perturbed at the driver's ignorance and poor decision after witnessing the devastating effects of texting and driving at accident sites...,"" and believes that, "" ... A text message that reads ""ok"" isn't worth a couple hundred dollar fine."" Not to mention, those involved in a distracted driving related accident risk jail time, and most certainly, an increase in insurance rates. According to, 10 Pragmatic Reasons That Will Make You Stop Texting and Driving Today, ""If texting and driving is included in the police report for an accident or wreck for which you are held responsible, you'll notice an even more significant rate increase. In some cases, your policy might be dropped completely."" Such a spike in cost or dropping of a policy would severely impact a driver. Hence, texting while driving is not worth the risk.

With the current trend of texting and driving, and all its risks included, drivers should not be allowed to operate cell phones while operating a vehicle. For, texting while driving takes a driver's attention off the road and endangers the lives of any passengers, other motorists, and

Hearing 3 pedestrians. Moreover, texting while driving increases a driver's chances of getting into an accident. As follows, once involved in a texting and driving related accident, either a driver's cost of a premium will skyrocket, or he or she will get dropped from their policy. To conclude, it is not safe nor wise for an automobilist to operate a cell phone while operating a vehicle.

""if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.""

Drivers should not have the chance to be able to use cell phones while in the capacity of operating a vehicle. This should already go without saying that being on your cellular device distracts you from the road and every thing around you so your reaction time to important things will be decreased greatly and you would be more likely to get in an accident. ""Distracted driving is dangerous, claiming 3,450 lives in 2016 alone. NHTSA leads the national effort to save lives by preventing this dangerous behavior.""

We say that driving while using your phone is illegal, but end up using your phones or doing everything else except drive.

""Texting is the most alarming distraction. Sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds. At 55 mph, that's like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed."" Everyone thinks that if they don't text that person or watches the last part of a funny video while driving its going to disappear, when the reality is that its going to be at the same place. ""NHTSA's campaigns and public service announcements make the case to Americans that safe driving means driving without distractions. You've likely seen or heard our public service announcements, but we're also on Facebook and Twitter sharing stories and tips to help save lives."" There are so many people trying to stop texing and driving because it can kill multiple people depending on who got in the accident or around it.

""Your State legislature and governor make the laws regarding distracted driving. Many States now have laws against texting, talking on a cell phone, and other distractions while driving. You can visit our State Laws page to learn about the laws in your State."" As you can see that texting and driving is really serious.

Car accidents seem to have been increasing due to the uproar of phones. More people have become distracted whether it's texting or driving, you're on a phone call, or just being on social media while driving, and with all these action being done while driving it's causing a lot of deaths in car accidents. According to the National Safety Council 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers being on the phone, with 314,000 of those incidents involved text messages. Using the phone while driving is reckless and needs to come to an absolute stop.

As more and more people gain more access to a phone texting and driving (or using the phone regardless) has almost become normal. Young drivers are the most at risk because using the the phone while driving distracts the brains and eyes from driving. Since technology will further blossom in the near future, the best way for teens to learn and prevent car crashes is advice from parents. Parents should talk to their young teen drivers about the safety of driving so they can prevent a car accident of worst. Parents should also avoid calling and texting their child while driving to insure the safety of their teen.

It's not just teen drivers at risk when they're using their phone while driving, adults are at a high risk too. In fact adults are put at a higher risk because studies have shown adults are more likely to use their phone and drive due to them thinking that since they have more experience behind the wheel. Adults are equally responsible behind the wheel just as much as a teen is when it comes to using a phone. In 2012 over 3000 people died in car accidents with someone in either car being a distracted driver. If anything adult drivers should be held more to a higher standard simply because they are older and have to lead by example for up and coming drivers who learn how to drive by watching whatever adult drives them around. Let only it may be more dangerous to an adult driver because 9 times out of 10 they are driving with a passenger or even worse a someone's child or a child of their own. When driving adults should be more careful while being on the phone and driving because they never know who's watching them.

Distracted drivers in this current day in age need to be a lot more careful. Because every day more and more people are now getting on the road and becoming a distracted driver and not being aware of what's going on, on the road around them. All distracted driving needs to come to a halt so everyone can one day and not having to worry about if their teen drivers is going to make it home okay or if they would make it home today.

Cell phones and other portable devices are used and carried by almost everyone at almost every time. Technology has pushed us forward, but with us using it everywhere, we are using it in moving vehicles at over 35 miles per hour. Many people ever realize how dangerous it is to text and drive, however its just as dangerous to talk on the phone and drive, hands free tools don't help much either. No driver should use a cellphone mid drive for many reasons.

Cell phones are dangerous, texting to someone on a device while driving is more than dangerous. However it is also risky to Talk to someone on the phone while driving as well ""1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone...""(CELL PHONE USE WHILE DRIVING STATISTICS). The chances of crashing while texting is just as high. Many people who text and drive are teenagers new to driving, and most likely not used to paying attention only on the road. Young people are early to most new technology, and on that technology is social media, a somewhat more elaborate set of texts. Most people may think, oh we can put it on a stand and let a screen reader read it to us and use voice to text cover texting, that is not how it works.

Many People try tools where they can place their phone on like a stand, or bluetooth device, these hands free tools don't always work. Talking to someone is one of the more distracting things a driver can do, ""Talking on a hands-free celluar device ranked in the middle of the spectrum - more distracting than talking to a passenger...""(The evidence on hands-free cell phone devices while driving). Just taking is dangerous enough, however most passengers react to what you're driving towards and will stop. In most conversations with phone users, the person out of the car can not see what is ahead and have a continuously normal speech pattern, making it just as complex on the driver to take as ever. Many people consider this a safer option, despite the fact that there is overwhelming evidence of hands free devices being negative, it is not as spread out as texting and driving warnings. No one should talk on cellular devices and drive, but many people do, most who do are new to driving and just got their licence.

Most people who use cell phones and drive are younger, inexperienced drivers who just got their licence. Many times they are not used to multitasking, especially involving driving, 'Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.',(CELL PHONE USE WHILE DRIVING STATISTICS). When these teens hear their phone ring, they will naturally pick up their phone and answer it, they rarely know what trouble they are getting themselves into. Many teenagers are early to try out new social media websites, applications, or even new mobile devices, they are most of the time the first to use these once they are on the market, and they might be too drawn in by their technology to pay attention to driving. Most teens will learn engaged driving in time, but when they do not know what that is or are not doing it, they can doom themselves. A variety of people drive and use the phone, but a chunk of them are teenagers, but they will grow out of it if they are smart enough to.

Many people text and drive, but more people use the phone and drive, both are equally distracting to the driver but only one is ignored on the road. Some people know that using a cellular device and driving is bad, so they logically do not. However many teenagers use their cell phone and drive, and many people have tried hands free tools and devices. Cell phones never have worked well with driving, and only will when self driving cars are popularized.

FAE31B5D596D,"There is a huge issue now and days with driving and cellular devices. There has been many reports of texting while driving causing car accidents and many deaths in the past 10 years. People should not be allowed to operate cell phones while driving. Operating a cellular device is a major distraction and does plenty of harm rather than good. These distractions are causing families to lose loved ones and to constantly mourning when these incidents can be avoided.

Texting is one of the main issues when using cell-phones while driving. ""According to The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year."" (edgarsnyder. com) Not only does cell phone use while driving cause crashes it also cause deaths. In the year of 2017 alone it has been reported that 3,477 people have died from distracted driving. These death tolls have only been increasing and it has to be stopped.

Teen distracted driving is even worse than adults. Teens are very distracted in general when it comes to school, relationships, social media,etc. This means that their minds are already running a mile per minute. This causes them to be in high risk of getting into accidents because their full attention is not on the road. On top of this when teens are texting and driving this completely takes their entire attention away from the road and not only puts their lives at risk but also leaves other drivers, pedestrians, and passengers in their cars at risk.

Driving distractions are not only caused by cell-phones there are other factors to consider.

These factors include cognitive, visual, and manual; Cognitive consists of taking your mind off driving. Visual includes taking your eyes physically off the road. Lastly, manual means to take your hands off the wheel. All of these things are normally done in a back to back sequence.

Which cause accidents to occur and vehicles to also become damaged.

Thankfully there have been laws passed recently that are now prohibiting cell-phone use while operating a motor-vehicle. Even though this law has been put into effect drivers are still using cell-phones. The consequence for not adhering to this law is a 100 dollar fine, a ticket, and a bad note on your license. Due to drivers ignoring this law people are continuing to become injured and worse lose their lives. To prevent these horrific things from occuring providers have made a system while driving on the phones that enables a person from receiving messages while driving. With these provisions we should see a substantial difference in the death and injury toll in our communities.   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8
C658668D91DD,"It will kill you, maybe not today, but all it takes is a second. Texting and driving has become the number one cause of car accidents. It is very distracting and it sure does not do any good for anyone. Nothing is as important as someone's life, especially a text message. It can wait until you reach our destination. Using cellphones while driving is extremely dangerous and should not be allowed at all.

Texting and driving seems simple but it is not, it distracts the driver and it puts the driver's life as well as others in danger. In today's society many teen drivers own a cellphone and are constantly on them for social media. Most of these drivers use their phones while driving. According to teensafe. com, 58% of teen crashes has been linked to distracted driving. It only takes three seconds after a driver takes their eyes off the road for a crash to occur. Social media and all the other platforms are such a distraction for the younger generation of drivers and it has led to fatal incidents.

People who use their phones while driving typically use it to text someone or post something on social media and what they don't realize is the dangers of that one text message. When driving, if someone texts you, they can wait until you are not driving for a response. Nothing will ever be more important than being safe on the road while driving, meaning not being distracted. Although calling someone while driving does distract the driver, it is a little safer than texting and driving. As long as the call is bluetooth and handsfree then there is no problem with that being allowed while driving. There should be an exception to that which is that any driver under the age of 18 should not have their phones out at all, not even wireless calling.

Texting and driving has no beneficial outcome, so there is no reason to do it. A distracted driver could get in a car accident and get killed. They could also injure someone else and then be left with the consequences of it. The insurance will be raised very high, there will be medical bills for the injured party that has to be paid, there will be fines to be paid, possible jail time, and suspension of your driver's license. Nothing good comes from texting and driving. The vehicles after a wreck will be damaged and it will just be unnecessary stress and problems added to a driver's life that could have been prevented.

Many states, including California, has already banned the use of cellphones while driving. There is a hands-free law that prohibits having a cellphone in your hands while driving. Distracted driving is never a good idea, no matter how important someone believes the message is. Distracted driving leads to fatal accidents and deaths of many people.

Studies show that people that use their cell phone while driving puts the driver at four time greater risk of a crash, but despite the danger people still use their phone because they want to always be in touch with others people. Also people that drive using two hands might be in an emergency test situation and might have to text back using two hands to go faster. Also talking on the phone should be avoided because it's just as dangerous as texting. Other people say that hands free set is safety because people can drive using two hands, but however hands free devices do not take down the risk of causing an accident and it. She have to live with that for the rest of her life knowing she killed someone.

A story of a young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone.

Cell phones a tool widely used in our society today. A cell phone has many purposes it can be used for communication, entertainment, and information. Most people have their own cellular devices. All around, it's extremely useful, but can also be very distracting leading to mishaps occurring. Lots of people like you and I have a horrible habit of using our phones, while operating dangerous machinery like automotives. Which increases the risk of accidents occurring. Laws should restrict the usage of cell phones use while driving on the road to prevent accidents from transpiring.

Distractions lead to mishaps happening more often increasing the risk of injury to oneself and others around them. Many people use their cell phones while driving. In fact, ""1 out of 3 people text while driving"" and ""texting while driving increases the risk of crashing by 23 times"" (NHTSA, 2019). Sometimes drivers get distracted but, ""the maximum amount of time a driver can safely divert their attention from the road from is two seconds, it takes a driver five seconds - on average - to send a text message"" and ""82% of American teens have a cell phone. 52% of these teens note that they talk on the phone while driving and 32% text on the road"" (TeenSafe, 2019). Everyday there is an accident and everyday ""11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving"" (TeenSafe, 2019). This loss of life can be avoided if there are regulations limiting the usage of cell phones.

Laws should be kept in place to help prevent the usage of cell phones while driving. With these laws unnecessary loss of life can be avoided, and accidents prevented. Every time someone is distracted on the road it increases the risk of a fatal accident. Many people out there all around should be safe and smart about driving, and the more they do the more lives are not at risk.

Drivers should they or should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle? Drivers should not attend to a mobile device while operating a vehicle. This action is the main source of car accidents due to decreasing the drivers awareness on the road causing injury and/or death .

Some states have banned the use of hand-held cell phones while driving to take precaution. Driving distracted is one of the main causes of car accidents over the last two decades. Each year 6 million cases of car accidents take place, which roughly per day is 16,438. About 3 million people are injured or disabled and 6,000 deaths happen annually. According to statistics in 2010 the loss of human lives due to car accidents cost almost 1 trillion dollars, the highest price we pay for the loss of others in the collision of vehicles.

Most states have passed or are passing a law, illegal to use your phone while operating a vehicle. Most states banned use of cell phones while driving are different from others or either similar. For example the state of Georgia banned all drivers under the age of 18 and school bus drivers to the utilization of phones. As in Arizona school bus drivers and learner's permit and existing license holders during the first six months after licensing aren't allowed to operate a mobile device while the driver's vehicle is in motion. Although these states' rules are slightly contrasted from each other, the use of texting, hand held calls, and possession of devices in the palm is prevented.

Cell phones are a very dangerous distraction to you and those around you, but can have its benefits such as navigation and the use for help or assistance. Many cell phones have GPS assistance which provide direction to arrive at your designated destination. Cell phones also allow users to contact aid whether its an ambulance, the police, or help with your car while on the road. Although these actions are very safe they should not be acquired while a vehicle is in motion to prevent any dangerous interactions.

In conclusion cell phones should not be used while driving. Put down your mobile device, the call or text received is worth the wait than worth being in a major or minor accident. Without the distraction your attention is focused on the road and your surroundings. This action taken is safer for you and your environment.

There should be no cell phones while people are behind the wheel. This can increase traffic, cause crashes, and can even get you pulled over. There is no text that is worth the risks that you take by using it while driving. Most may use it for gps but that is something that can be used before you start your car, and it can be put on speaker so you can hear the directions. It can only take one time that you think its ok to pull it out; only for it to cause you time, money, and quite possibly your life.

Using your cell phone while operating a vehicle is also a hindrance on other drivers as well. The phone is a distraction that can slow down the smoothly moving traffic and back things up. Examples are not paying attention to the change of lights while sitting at a red light. That keeps others from moving along with their driving and will cause traffic jams in big cities where cell phone usage is most used. Which in big cities can be a big factor to car crashes

In most states having your cell phone out while driving is illegal for newer drivers and can be punishable with the suspension of your license. For others the punishment can be a fine that goes up to $150 in Georgia which is one of the highest in the country. Having to deal with a fine given and being pulled over can stop you from getting to your destination to a party , meeting, or even just home. Now you run the chance of being late because you needed to check your phone while driving. Even if you are just checking for a split second you open yourself to the risks of your divided attention.

On the other hand people justify the usage of phones while driving a vehicle as an emergency that they can't miss. Sometimes you run into those calls or texts that you just cant miss. Understanding that yes, life does get in the way and some things need urgent reactions. You can just as quickly stop on the side of the road to not only be safer while checking the emergency, but also giving your full attention to the matter rather than half and half. You will be able to safely deal with the emergency that arises calmly as well since you are stopped, such as setting the gps to a new destination if needed, or even finding a new place to eat.

While people think they can use their phones and drive, it's not the smartest idea. Crashes, traffic backups, and fines are all outcomes from using them. It puts not only you in danger but others as well The text or call you miss is not worth what you could pay. The payment could range from money you may not have, or even your or somebody else's life.

In essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I say that when operating a vehicle that people should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Some of the reasons are that people use their cell phones for just about everything such as texting, talking, schedule planning, or even going on the internet. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Truth be told people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones while they are driving. We all have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety and safety of others because of our phones.

What people should know is that other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Retarded driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Drivers are also tailgating you because of again the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. For example a young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone.

Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. A person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out potentially dangerous activity like driving. Banning cell phone while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. A more reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving is to prevent car insurance from rising. In more studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of the distracted driving.

In the United States car crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause to distracted driving is cell phones.

A cell phone helps drivers with immediate roadside assistance, in case of a serious car accident. Cell phone's allow drivers to get directions turn by turn with the helping of GPS technology. Phone cameras are very important in a case of a hit and run accident, it allows a person to take a picture of the license plate. Some insurance companies may require a picture of an accident.

They can be used as a gps.

It helps people who are driving alone and can't get someone else to use a paper map.

Another would be holding a conversation with someone one the phone.

Using a hand held cellphone while driving is very dangerous to the person who's driving and to the other people who's on the road. Because it's very difficult for the driver to pay attention to the road. It's make the driver forget they there the only person driving on the highway.

Today in society people all have a cell phone to call, text or explore things that may interest them. They also have access to a vehicle (Car, Truck, RV, Etc.) to which they can drive from place to place. Phones and vehicles are the same since both are a privilege to have and are not a basic human right. The use of allowing one to drive a vehicle while he or she uses a phone is an interesting topic to discuss. Both are also what teenagers are expected to get when they reach the age of 16.

In my opinion I believe that phones should not be used while a driver is driving. Driving is important to reduce time to get from one place to another. It can be dangerous to drive if one does not focus on the road. If someone is driving and they waste a second on their phone they could harm or possibly kill someone for not looking who is in front of them. Driving with a phone or in your lap could even distract you long enough to not get the steering wheel and may worsen one's driving skills.

Also if one decides to drive with their phone they are not just putting everyone else at risk, they're putting themselves at risk as well. According to a statistic 58% of teen crashers are because of distracted driving. Meaning that without the use of their phone more than half of teen crashes would be reduced and less harm would be done. Another study states ""Text messaging increases the risk of crash or near-crash by 23 times."" Meaning that just receiving or glancing at the phone for a second could cause a crash.

However, phones can or should be used only in an emergency. An example is when one needs directions to get to a location that is fine to use the phone. If there is Bluetooth, then connect it to the cell phone if it is compatible to focus more on the road. Or if you need to use your phone just find somewhere to park or stop somewhere and use your phone there. Unless it is for an emergency or something of great importance this is the only time a phone should be allowed.

In conclusion, phones should not be allowed to be used while in a car. Text messages and phone calls themselves cause unnecessary to both civilians and to oneself.

Cell phones were introduced in the United States market in the decade of 1980 and their usage instantly grew during the next two decades. Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that a hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to losing control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that a hands-free set is safe because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using a headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distract drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image of the person who they are talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrians step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time which may cause an accident because of lack manoeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particular time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is an illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in a car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of an accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact the police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepared to help you in an accident.

These days accidents are mostly caused by cell phones usage while operating a vehicle. Statistics show that one out of every four car accidents in the united states is caused from cell phone usage while driving (edgarsnyder. com). You can admit, it is hard to keep focus on the road when a phone is present. It is believed that phones shouldn't be in use while driving a vehicle. It is very dangerous for you and everyone else around you. There is always a chance of danger and with distraction from your phone there is a higher chance for an accident.

Or what about when you and someone else are waiting at a stop sign and you're busy on your cell phone and ""boom"" you hit them? There was a possibility you could have ended their life. That phone call or text message could've been responded to when you got to your destination. Am I right? Now a days, most people are afraid of traveling on the road because one they are afraid they may get hit, two they might hit someone, or three there's traffic somewhere. My mother won't even let me drive because she's hearing so many stories on how teens are losing their lives because of their cellphones. Would you want to let your child drive on a dangerous road knowing that there are people not paying attention to the road? No I don't think so.

Also, insurance rates are rising throughout the nation, so many accidents are around and typically they are because of a phone. There are many ways of causing an accident but ""Driver error is most often the result of ""distracted driving."" By far the most common cause of driver distraction is the use of cell phones"" according to Dr. Daniel Landers. But why is a phone more important than your safety? It shouldn't be. There are now many states in the United States with the ""hands free"" law to prevent people from using cellphones while operating the vehicle and so far, there have been less accidents involving phone usage.

In conclusion, laws have been enacted to protect all citizens from distracted drivers.

Specifically drivers who use their cellphones responsibly with hands free devices ensures that all citizens get to their destination safer than when these laws weren't in effect. As a result, drivers can expect decreased insurance costs in the future.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

This is extremely dangerous because if the car begins to swerve you will have a delayed reaction and less time to react.

These laws have good intentions but many simply choose to ignore them. Even with these laws accidents still occur because of phones many just simply don't care. When people ignore these laws they need to be enforced better as many still text and drive. Even with laws in place many will text and drive and not care for others or themselves.

There are also apps to help you limit the use of texting and driving as you can make your phone not receive messages while you are driving.

Even with laws or apps many will still text and drive. This still causes many problems as you are not only endangering you but the people around you.

In sixteen states, along with United States territories: Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, even holding your phone while driving in general is illegal. In nineteen states, holding while driving in the presence of children, in the case of bus drivers, is illegal as well. Just how dangerous is cell phone use while driving if it is banned in almost twenty states? According to the CDC, ""Each day in the United States, approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver."" (CDC.gov). Texting while driving can not only take your life, but an innocent bystanders'. Even though everyone knows these dangers, yet people still text and drive.

To understand why people still text and drive, there is context on just how much people use their phones every day. According to study by Dscout, the average person will touch their phones 2,617 times a day; they will spend around four hours in total every day going through their phone. With every alert and message the phone gives off, people are more likely to check it. Social media updates and a quick text message may seem like a safe way to use your cellular device while on the highway, but in reality those few seconds their eyes are down to their screens, can cause disaster. Phone use has been shown to be highly addictive and American cellular companies need to make phone easier to ignore while on the road.

In conclusion, texting and driving is harmful to everyone. The people who are injured or are killed, their friends, and their families alike. Ways to connect your phone to the car completely hands free needs to be taught to everyone. The unnecessary phone activity needs to diminish. Phones are highly addictive but they will never be as important as someone's life.                     ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, int ernet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of theset hings at the same t ime. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one t ime that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can' t put down our cell phones.

Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the drive r themselves for a couple of good reasons. When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on t he road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phoneswhether they want to or not because of the hazards they creat e. Err atic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us.

As scott Clark, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consult ancy

Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of the rusty red Camaro (tailgating) the minivan full of kids."" Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestr ians.

Furthermore, there are number of traditional ways that distracts driver's attention.

They include talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. It is pertinent to mention that attention of driver distracted through cell phones means driving and communicating at the same time that increases threats to safety. Drivers has also to operate both, vehicle and cell phone, simultaneously, that also distract attention leading to dangerous accidents, and in some cases resulting in death of driver and passengers. In other words, cell phones reduce driver's performance.

Drivers demonstrates comparatively slower braking responses and also had low awareness of other traffic flowing through the roads ignoring their presence concentrating more on cell phones and less on roads as how other drivers are behaving. Different studies have reported hundreds of deaths during a year because of using cell phones during driving. It can be concluded that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving distracts attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.

I strongly agree that phones should be banned while driving because of all the accidents they are causing. These are causing insurance to rise and causing scare to people's health. Studies have proven that drivers who use phones while driving are more responsible for the cause of an accident. Driving is dangerous technique and to safely execute driving you should be 100% focused, but if you are drunk or on your phone, you are potentially in danger to yourself and others on the road. As a society, we have become very less mindful of everything going on around us and do not take much precaution of things happening right in front of us.

Many people think distractions while driving is only texting and driving but in fact, while driving, sometimes it is easy to lose focus on the road because you are on the phone or because so much could be happening around you, but this means you forget you are on the road with others, instead of by yourself. Research has it, "" The available studies so far suggest that talking on the phone while driving, even hands-free, is as bad or worse than driving drunk. ... A test of 41 adults found that driving while intoxicated was actually less dangerous than driving while talking on a hand-held phone or a hands-free phone.""

Many people like to use their phone while driving for many reasons. Whether it's for changing the music or to yell at the GPS when you get lost. Sometimes there are emergency phone calls that make you feel like they can't wait. Especially with the growth of technology drivers are most likely to grab their cellphones. Many of these reasons are the main cause of car accidents that happen in today's world. With distractions from the road drivers are most likely to swerve into the other lane or crash into another. Therefore Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle for the safety of others and for themselves.

Due to a report of accidents that happened in 2018 about ""40,000 people lost their lives to car crashes"" and 4,637 of those people died in the crash due to cell phone usage. Texting and driving can cause about 5 times as many accidents as drunk driving. Technology has grown and so has the usage of cellphones. Nowadays people use their phone to locate the nearest coffee shop or to watch their shows, the thing is they watch it at the most inappropriate time. Instead of focusing on the road the driver puts all their attention towards the phone causing them to swerve into the other lane or hit another car that's slowing down on the highway. In the state of Georgia there was a bill that was passed known as the House Bill 673. This bill is also known as the `Hands Free Law ' ''. This law basically says that under no condition should the cellphone be in the driver's hand at any time. The consequence of this bill is a ""Fine of $50-$150 depending on the offence"" (Google). With this bill passed many more civilians will be able to not use their phone and be less likely to get into accidents because if the driver gets caught with it they will have to pay a fine and get a point on their license.

Texting and driving is not only risky but can put the driver and other drivers on the road lives on the line. Just because a driver can get away with texting and driving once doesn't mean it won't catch up to them one day. Based on a real event a teen killed a father and his 10 year old daughter after she ""ran a red light because she was allegedly texting"" (teensafe. com). The teen was sentenced to 4 year probation and had to do community service. Not only could the driver take one's life and be scarred but could also do damage to their family members. That is why there are clubs and teen meets that talk about the danger of texting and driving and most of the teachers have experience the horror themselves or had lost a loved one due to an event like the mother of a teen in washington who ""Died after she was allegedly distracted by an incoming text while driving"" (teensafe. com) the mother ""now helps teens understand the dangers and uses a video that recreates her daughters crash to illustrate the horror""

Therefore texting in driving in any state should not be allowed, in fact it should pass the ""hands Free Law"" in every law that should prohibit the driver from touching their phone or having any part of their body supporting the phone. Not only will this help the safety of the driver but will benefit the other drivers on the road. More teen clubs should be made in order to get the message out on the dangers of texting and driving in order to prevent accidents from distracted drivers. As technology grows, so will distractions.              ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

In today's society, people have and use cell phones. Cell phones have become an addiction. People can't seem to put them down. Some people feel that people should not use their phones while driving their cars. I feel this way too. Using cell phones while driving have negative consequences in two ways. One, cell phones distract the driver. Two, cell phones are unsafe.

To begin with, phones can easily distract the person who's driving the car. The reason is that when that person is driving his car and when a notification ringer goes off, the driver would rush to his phone to see what came up. When this happens, he would then lose focus on the road and might kill someone. Whenever someone is driving his car he needs to focus on the road at all times. Distract driving is one of the main reasons why there's more car accidents in this country, especially Georgia. When the government starts enforcing no phones while driving, this will help end distractive driving and less car accidents would happen in cities and on the highway. Cell phones distracting the drivers is one of the main points why people should not use their phones while driving a car.

Next, drivers who use their phones while driving can be unsafe for the driver and other people who are around them. The reason is that when drivers are driving, they need to check their surroundings to make sure they do not hit someone or something. In the case of using a phone while driving can cause many deaths from getting run over/ hit from the car or from a car crash. This is really important that people need to be aware of what they're doing because if they make one mistake, it can cause a lot of lives. Safety is really important when it comes to using a phone because people can save lives if they put the phone down and focus on the road so that everyone can create a safer environment for people who want to drive their car. Most deaths are caused by car accidents due to using the phone while driving because people do not think about being safe not only for themselves but also the passengers who are in the car with them. Safety is one thing people need to take a stand on, because drivers need to realize that if they do not put the phone down, then it could create more deaths and less safety in the area.

In conclusion, drivers who use their phone while in the process of driving can end in an unsafe situation not only for themselves, but everyone that is around them. Distracting driving and safety are the two reasons why people should not use their phones while in the process of driving. Phones can easily take away the focus on the road because it leads to bad outcomes in the end.                           ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Drivers are at a four time greater risk of causing an accident when driving and texting. While using their cell phones drivers lose sight of the task at hand and stop paying attention to what they are doing. According to the ""National Safety Council"" ""Cell phones used while operating a motor vehicle leads to 1.6 million crashes a year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused from distracted driving by cell phone usage."" Not many take driving seriously until you consider how many people die each day and how many in a year due to a fatal car crash. Well According to ""Teen Safety"" ""Over 3,287 deaths occur daily due to a car crash.""

Distracted driving whether it be from cell phone usage, eating, drinking, operating a radio, or even being lost in thought, it can lead to injuries or even death. When a vehicle is moving at the speed of 35 to 45 mph, Depending on the age of the drivers and passengers in both cars determines the fatality or how sever the injuries are in an accident.

When drivers are trying to text and drive at the same time they are not thinking about how their actions can affect those around them. Drivers are not thinking about how they are putting someone else's life at risk or in danger when they are distracted driving from improper cell phone usage. Drivers are not considering that from the actions they are taking by using their cell phones that someone could lose their life or end up in the hospital with very severe injuries. Drivers who cannot wait to use their phone until the vehicle has come to a complete stop meaning that the vehicle is completely off are being really selfish and inconsiderable of those around them.

So in conclusion drivers should not be able to use a cell phone while operating a motor vehicle because it is not safe for them or those around them and it can and will affect someone's life whether it's the driver who is using their cell phones to the people in the opposite car that they have had an accident with even down to the passengers in the same vehicle.

Many habitants of planet earth have and use their cellular device as second nature. Cellphones, while useful in the sense of communication, entertainment, and business transactions, can be dangerous tools of distraction behind the wheel. An example of this would be the statistics based on vehicular manslaughter and other effects of the car accidents that are recorded each year. Tens of thousands of Americans are victims of car accidents every year with the distraction of cellphones being the lead cause for fender benders every year. Governments officials and representatives are faced with the same issue and must constantly find a solution to the issue of cellphone use behind the wheel. The main question being whether cell phone use should be allowed at all while operation heavy machinery.

That being said, it would be for the better of humanity if cellphones be allowed only when at a complete stop with the vehicle in park. The reason why the allowance would be more beneficial than the stripping of the whole ability is because of the instinctual nature of humans to do what seems good even if it is forbidden. This can be seen in the Book of Genesis, where Eve chooses the forbidden fruit over every other fruit in the garden, due to the thought that she would never be able to taste that specific fruit if she were to obey God's orders. This shows the weakness in man, that, even if he or she should be shunned, smitten, banished, or punished in any way by the highest power, man shall carry out the forbidden just to have a form of secret liberty.

This liberty would remain in the citizens' mindsets if they had the ability of freedom that would be disguised by regulations. The perception of a freedom is a more effective way to regulate the general population that the prohibition of the acts that are the root of a problem, such as the case of the dangers of texting and driving. The first regulation would include the full stop of a vehicle, ensuring that the driver is not endangering the lives of everybody else when they need their phone. The second part of the new rule would call for the mandatory parking of the car, so that the car has no potential to endanger the other lives on the road. These rules would send the message that the nation needs to stay focused on the task of driving and should refrain from getting distracted by phone use.

The task of driving is a boring task, thus the temptation of using a device to make the job of travel less monotonous becomes more alluring to the driver. Therefore, the use of cell phones should still be partially allowed for those who ride the road every day. To ask for the privilege be taken all together would cause uproar and rebellion, but to give that chance to change a song on the phone, or to reroute the GPS software on the phones leaves a margin of freedom for the civilians who are forced to follow the policy. Without those exact laws, every nation will continue to face accidents and become yet another percentage on the yearly submission of the quota for accidents and deaths caused using cell phones.

Overall, to avoid becoming a statistic in the list of deaths, it would behoove the general populations to insert these regulations into their driving lives. This would promote a safer environment for travel and would reduce the number of driving hazards and obstacles by a grand percentage. All it takes to keep oneself safe and others safe is the awareness and comprehension of the activity on the road, rather than the activity on a phone.

If its an emergency you should pull over and put your car in park and do what you need to do instead of endangering yourself or other drivers on the road with you.

Many people say that hands free set is a safety because you have 2 hands on the wheel instead of one on your phone and the other on the wheel. But however i think its still not safe because you would be more into texting or calling someone instead of driving. People have been immune to their phones that they gotta be on their phone every second even while driving. Its not just young drivers its older experienced drivers too.

People should not use their phones while driving because it is a huge safety hazard with many deadly consequences. Another reason, it puts the people that don't have car insurance at risk as well. People in America fall to realize the amount of damage they do when doing something so dangerous to ourselves and to other people. People who don't care about their own lives would do an action like this.

It's basically a safety hazard when it comes don't to situations like this. For example in 2019 there were over 55,000 accidents over the country every day and it's because a person is on his or her phone.

Have you ever seen someone on their phone while driving and not paying any attention? It's becoming more common to see drives on the road and using their cell phones. Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time , they have become a key part of our lives now. People today use their phones to check up on social media, the latest news reports and also to stay in touch with loved ones. We should not be able to use phones while driving because not only is it against the law it also causes people to get easily distracted and lose focus on the road ahead.

One reason why individuals should not use phones while driving is because it can cause the lack of focus to the driver. Sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone. Not having both hands on the wheel and your eyes focused on your phone can cause a huge accident. Not only can you hurt yourself in an accident you can also hurt other individuals in other vehicles and also passengers in the car with you. For example your phone rings and you get a notification. Why reaching for your phone you can fail to notice major activities happening on the road.

Another reason why phones should not be used while driving. Because driving and on the phone is against the law. According to state law "" Drivers may listen to streaming music that does not include videos on the screen of their phone or device while driving but cannot touch their phones while on the road to activate or program any music streaming app.

Streaming music that is controlled by and listened through the vehicle's radio is allowed.

Drivers who need to touch their phones to activate/program their music streaming apps must do so before getting on the road"" (""Hands-Free Law"") .

Which gives people a clear understanding on what the rules and regulations and the right from wrong are about using phones while driving.

In conclusion phones should not be used while driving. It is a distraction and can hurt others around. You can get in on accident and it can affect your whole life forever. And also using your phone while driving is against the law. Even if you want to check your phone at a stop light still don't. Now the only way you can possibly answer the phone is for emergencies only and the phone must be on speaker so you can still pay attention to the road ahead.

Responsibility of Texting and Driving

Cell phones are everywhere! Everyone has a phone or some type of electronic device. These devices are very useful, but they can also be a distraction. Driving is a freedom that many people look forward to obtaining in their lives, but it is also a major responsibility. Some things go together, like peanut butter and jelly, but cellphones and driving are not a good match.

Driving and texting is one of the number one causes of traffic accidents.

Drivers should not be able to utilize their cell phone at any time while operating a vehicle because it distracts them from the road and decreases their awareness.

Cell phones can be useful while driving, but they can lead to distractions. Many people use cell phones to get directions when they are lost or stream music.

The apps that are used to give directions and to listen to music are great, but the notifications from other social media apps can be a major distraction. According to the NY Post, ""Americans check their phone on average once every 12 minutes - burying their heads in their phones 80 times a day"" (NYP).

This study was done in 2017.

People check their phones more now than they did back in 2017 because there are more apps that people can download on their phones.

If phones were just used for giving directions or listening to music while driving, it would be okay, but everyone does not think to turn off their notifications so their phones become a major distraction. Therefore, it is a safer option to just not use the phone at all while driving.

Not only are phones a major distraction, they decrease awareness and slow a person's reaction.

When a person is driving, they have to pay attention to their surroundings and quickly respond when other drivers drive recklessly. If someone is on their phone, their awareness is decreased and they do not respond as quickly as they would if they did not have their phone in their hand.

The only thing that drivers should be focused on is the steering wheel and road.

In the end, using a phone while driving can cause accidents because it is a major distraction and it decreases awareness. When people use their phones and drive, they are putting their life and the lives of other people at risk. Even the most aware drive can get distracted by their phone. Using the phone for just a few seconds while driving can result in a major accident that could kill multiple people. The safest option for everyone is to simply stop, park, and use the phone.          ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Over the last several years, mounting evidence has suggested that paying any sort of attention to a cell phone while operating a vehicle can have disastrous consequences. However, people continue to overestimate what they are capable of, at the expense of themselves and others. What the scientific community has concluded is that the bottom line for why accidents happen is distraction. This comes in the form of anything that requires you to pay attention to things other than the road, such as a text message. Cell use may not have to be prohibited while in a vehicle per se, but certainly while operating one on an open road.

The largest study ever conducted on texting while driving likely also offers the best data.

This study is of course the one done by Zendrive, which analyzed the driving behavior of 3.1 million Americans. What this study found is that, of the people that drive, 88% use their cell phone in some capacity. What's more, this in spite of rigorous campaigns railing against distracted driving. Given the slight changes between two generations of drivers, we can assume it will take some time to get the habit worn away from most members of our society. This said, it's unlikely that legislating harder restrictions will change the amount of people who text and drive to an observably good degree. The biggest changes happen culturally, and slowly.

The dangers of texting while driving rival the dangers of drinking while driving. Several studies have shown in driving simulations that being distracted by a text can be as dangerous as operating a vehicle while intoxicated. A quarter of adults report that texting while driving doesn't hinder their driving performance. Any form of activity that takes attention away from the task is a costly chance.

Multitasking is the real killer here. People aren't good at it; it's asking too much of the brain. Humans are really good at focusing on one activity at a time, and anything more than that dramatically decreases proficiency. One study from the Scientific American shows that confident multitaskers are more prone to mistakes than their non confident counterparts.

None of this is to say that there is never a time to use a cell phone while in a car. Just, never while driving. It's a risk with little to no reward, but given the amount of people already doing it, knowing it's a mistake, it's unlikely that legislating against it will bring about the cultural shift required to make good changes. What we can do, though, is encourage safer practices for cell phone use in vehicles. Like pulling over to make phone calls or texts.

Your main concern while your driving is that you obey the law and don't get in any wrecks. Your cellphone should not be your main concern while you are driving because it causes wrecks because your not paying attition to the road. Most wreck are because of people on their cellphones.

Texting and driving has its pros and cons. One pro is that you could get a text about an emergency and you could possibly save someones life.

Some of the cons are that you can get in wrecks, get injured, and even die because you were texting and driving.

It is the number one cause for wrecks in the world and it can also take your life.

Phones have become such an integral part of today's society in such a small amount of times. To the point where it is now considered surprising to not have one of these handheld devices. People are able to contact their family from miles away, check up on the weather, and even entertain themselves on their by watching videos or playing games. However, it isn't all good. Phones become entertaining to the point of distraction. Most of the world having to come up with new rules and laws for these devices and anything like them. 26% of the population getting into car accidents from being distracted by their phones from texting ('How Many Car Accidents Are Caused by Cellphones?' by Bay and Associates). Question is, should drivers be able to use their phones while driving in any capacity? Especially with the rise of their popularity and use with each generation?

Phones should be continued to be used by drivers in most capacities. Not everything should be allowed to continue or be taken off of the law, like the use of any social media or texting for example, because a phone has more uses than that. Texting if obviously the main thing we blame car accidents on, but sometimes it's more than that. Social media platforms can lead to distractions as well. Snapchat, a picture/video media platform led to a girl taking a photo in her car only to crash not even 20 minutes later back in April 2019 ('Teen who drove 106mph, used Snapchat in crash that killed friend is going to prison.' by Noah Feit). While things like that are horrible they shouldn't be banned completely while driving. If someone gets lost on their road they can always use google maps to get back home to said person's families. Maybe a family member or close friend is having an emergency, medical or otherwise, and tries to call up that person but they can't say anything due to their phone being banned. Leaving the Family member/friend to be alone or call someone else.

There is also the fact that not all car accidents are caused by texting and driving. Yes. It is a leading cause, but there are plenty of other causes of car accidents ('Top 15 Causes Of Car Accidents And How You Can Prevent Them.' by Elizabeth Laiza King). There are the causes that is more human error. There is distracted driving, drinking and driving, speeding, running a red light, etc. Then there are the more natural causes that could happen to even the most innocent, careful and law abiding citizens. Rain and potholes being a good couple of them. Just imagine driving in the rain at night and up the street is a pothole that you can barely make out. Oh, but there could be a solution to these problems to reduce car crashes! Ban all of them. A good idea on paper, but impossible to do and succeed without any car accidents ever again. Obviously you can't ban rain from open roads, and car accidents caused by drinking happens more often than not.

Alcoholic influence and texting are two very different things. Both should be banned from driving, but banning your phone completely when driving is similar to banning a couple of bottles in the back of the car and getting in trouble for that. Even though you aren't touching them or plan on using it for later use outside of the car. The percentage of car accidents while drinking and driving being 28% ('Motor Vehicle Safety' by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). Meanwhile texting and driving being only 26%. A 2% difference. Still both very dangerous things. Yet drinking and driving still isn't banned completely. Yes, it's against the law, but you are allowed to drive after a couple of drinks as long as your Blood Alcohol Concentration stays at 0.08 at the maximum ('Alcohol & Drug Info: What is BAC?' by Stanford University: Office of Alcohol Policy and Education).

Phones as an entirety shouldn't be completely banned as long as alcohol isn't completely banned. Texting/messaging while driving should still be a concern, and shouldn't be reconsidered at all, but not everything is bad on a phone while driving. Coming into this new generation of drivers, it would be a good idea to start coming up with ways to possibly integrate these devices into driving tactics or the car itself. This way, it's possible to still get a use of a phone as well as lowering the car crash rate worldwide. Many cars coming up with this type of hands free technology. Jeep being a good example of this.          ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

In these times, it is essential to have one, even poor people can have an electronic device. With that being said they are always in people's faces everywhere you go, when we're walking, shopping, even when people are working they have their phones out, but if your job requires this it's ok. People always tend to be distracted by their devices which leads to them blindly making mistakes that could have easily been avoided if their head wasn't stuck in a phone. With that being said, the question for today is, should phones be allowed while driving in an automobile.

I personally don't think that phones should be allowed while driving unless you have your phone propped up in your car, and you're using it for directions, therefore you're in a place of need for your device. Otherwise i don't think you should be recklessly texting and driving because that doesn't only put you and your passengers in danger of crashing but also everyone else on the road around you. These types of fatal accidents always happen, because people think they can be aware enough to be on their phone and drive. An estimated amount of about 391,000 people were injured in texting and driving related crashes in 2017. This goes to show that you should always be careful because I am pretty sure everyone of those 300 thousand people didn't plan on getting into an accident before it happened.

Texting and driving is dangerous, it kills hundreds of people every year, especially since there are new drivers every year. Teen drivers are usually the ones who text and drive the most, which is another reason why teen crashes are at an alltime high. That doesn't mean adults don't do it, I personally know someone who was always on their phone when they were driving.

Texting, talking, or just catching up on social media, which is so irrelevant while you are driving. This person didn't learn until they crashed their car by rear ending a truck, and can you guess why this incident happened? It was because she was talking on her phone while it happened.

Being on your phone and driving can be avoided with all the technology we are starting to have now. Now we have tools that can hold your phone in a visible position without distracting your view from the road, And you don't have to hold it. Modern vehicles are also being made with built in screens which is like it's own phone in the car, which you can operate while parked, and some features while you are driving. Society is constantly upgrading so that incidents like these can stop happening so much, because they are so preventful. We as a society are starting to put our phones down, especially because if you are seen by a police officer with a phone in your hand while you're driving you can instantly get pulled over and get a ticket.

As a driver myself I try not to use my phone while I'm moving, I personally try to wait until I'm stopped at a red light or I stop at a stop sign. If I need directions I can put the computer in my car and it'll take me to my destination the same as my phone would. If I want to send a text, I can either use Siri or just call the person and use a handsfree call. We as a society need to learn how to work around the dangers when it comes to things like this that can put our lives in danger, and random innocent people in danger also. Because if we don't preventable tragedies like these will never end.   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Cell phones and cars are not a good mix and people should never try and use both at the same time. Using both phone and car at the same time can cause a major accident and can cause people to get hurt because someone wanted to use their phone while they drove their car. When you use your phone while driving you are putting more than yourself at risk of losing your life you also endanger the person you crash into and whoever you or they have in the car. When these two items mix it is no good for anybody especially the ones on the street.

The world is a very exciting place and there is so much to do and can even do multiple things at once, but somethings shouldn't be done while another is happening. Being on your phone while driving is one of the many things you shouldn't do it causes accidents that will leave someone badly damaged or without their life. When someone loses their life their family will grieve and you shouldn't want to be the cause of their or your family's grief so you should take precautions that you stay out of situations that could put you in the wrong spotlight.

On average 11 teens die a day from texting and driving. These are people who just wanted to see what their friends had to say or what's trending on instagram. As sad as it is, these people didn't take good precautions before they took off in the car, they just wanted to arrive at the location they were headed too. They didn't think that they were going to lose their life from texting and driving. People should learn from others' mistakes and shouldn't text and drive knowing it is dangerous.

There are over 2.35 million people in the United States today that are injured or disabled due to a car crash, and there are more than 330,000 of those accidents due to Texting and driving. When a person text while driving there is never a good outcome of them doing that a young teen or an older person or there self ends up getting hurt in the process. The generation today's technology has drastically increased. People are so reliant on the use of their phones and more things. Nowadays a lot of people don't even like to have a phone conversation simply because they can send it through a text. The conclusion of all the car wrecks the accident is mostly caused by a person wanting to text while driving .

The purpose of this essay is to give you some information on why you shouldn't text and drive at the same times. People always think they have to immediately have to respond to a text this is why many of the accidents occur. The ages that always cause accidents are the teens the ages from 17 and up they always act like soon as they hear that ding they have to check their phone. Don't text and drive text there is never a good outcome of that, think about your life and others. Text and drive doesn't mix you need your eyes on the road you can not text and drive, don't even think about picking your phone up. If you even think about picking your phone up just pause and think about how many lives you will be putting at risk by picking up your phone.

In a recent Google search, it was estimated that about ""1.2 billion people drive in the world"". Imagine if every driver had a cell phone, and used it while driving, this would cause a lot of distractions and possible deadly accidents. It is my belief that people should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Today's generation is really the most tech savvy because now people trying to use their phone while driving and it is very dangerous. Teens are very distracted by their phone and when they get a call or text they try to pick it up while driving that's why people need hand free Bluetooth in their car. According to Esurance, ""cognitive or mental distraction is when a driver's mind isn't focused on driving. Talking to another passenger or being preoccupied with personal, family, or work-related issues are some examples."" Teens would rather make snapchat videos then driving. While you drive put your phone on do not disturb while you drive or you put on their manual so it knows that you driving.

Secondly, you can also can get in a deadly accident while trying to text and drive. According to an Usa Today article,"" In Houston, the driver of a pickup truck that collided with a church minibus in rural Texas, killing 13 people, apologized after the crash and acknowledged he had been texting while driving."" People don't know how dangerous it is for you text and drive, until it's too late.

In a recent google search, it has been ""1.6 billon crashes each year by texting and driving"". Those are scary numbers!

Although, they made a new law that people in Georgia can't have their phones in their hands while driving. According to Alive, ""Georgia's hands-free law took effect on Sunday, July 1, 2018. It is a sweeping, landmark measure that has been under consideration for several years and will affect all of us as Georgians in one way or another."" People can't send or watch a video while driving. The hand free law is all over Georgia and they trying to spread it around the world so people hold their phone at all. Even though the law is in place, I see on a daily, drivers still using their phones.

In the end, people shouldn't use their phones while driving because it is not safe for people around the world. The law keeps the people safe and it is up to us to enforce and follow the laws to keep all drivers and passengers safe on the road.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6
D75762E19FF1,"Accidents occur more often than we think, especially while driving.

Just think, accidents can happen in the blink of an eye.

There are hundreds of different ways for accidents to occur while driving but I want to focus on texting while driving.

Let's just keep it real, it is difficult to drive and access a phone at the same time, at least that is some multi-tasking skills that no one should try to master.

In this essay, I will be discussing three reasons why texting is not appropriate while driving: distractions, swerving, and all reasons could lead to a potential crash.

Texting while driving becomes an obstruction to other drivers when you are at a stop sign or red light, you are literally watching a phone while others are waiting for you to proceed.

This can lead to people yelling and honking horns just get your attention.

It is just right to respect the fact that there are others on the road, just maybe they want to proceed forth without unnecessary setbacks.

It is safe to try to focus on the road or signs at all times, after all safety should be the main concern for any driver.

Next, there is also the fact that you can easily swerve lanes.

Swerving lanes can be life-threatening.

If you swerve lanes, you can cause several accidents at one time.

I have actually had an experience with something like this.

My mom was texting, when all of a sudden the car began to shift across to the lane, we wound up causing several accidents.

Last but not least, there could be a potential crash.

Obviously, the main reason for not texting while driving is crashing.

I am almost positive that there is some high percentage of crashes caused by text.

I don't have evidence, but it is kind of common sense.

I mean it is difficult to look down at a phone and try to drive at the same time, ""it's an accident waiting to happen"" so to speak.

In conclusion, the real reason not to text and drive is because you can crash and die.

There is no need to sugarcoat the obvious because the end results can end in death.

I try not to text while I am driving because I just started driving and my skills are limited.

I would hate to crash into an innocent person.

Let's all practice being more careful when driving.                ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
3B463A4C358F,"Cell phone use and driving has been a highly discussed topic in the past ten years. While cell phone use is almost unanimous, the danger of being distracted while driving has lead many states to ban the use of hand held cell phones while in the car. Passing laws that require hands free devices such as blue tooth to keep your attention on the road. While it is not a guarantee that this is totally safe it lowers the risk of loosing focus while driving. This is due to how our brain codes information and how we attend to certain stimuli. While driving we are taking in constant visual stimuli, for example when you are driving you see a red light and stop. While driving mmight become slightly autonomous over time, attentive and working memory resources are being used to watch the road. While you are physically looking at your phone when texting, you are also using mental resources to decode and sort what you are seeing. This means that even when you look up you could still be distracted from the road because your attentional resources are being split up between the phone and driving. Contrary to common belief there is no such thing as ""multitasking"". The brain cannot preform two tasks at the same time; it however switches between each task. Cell Phone Use and Driving: A Deadly Combination In the world today, society suffers from cell phone addiction. People everywhere use some sort of mobile device constantly. This addiction on its own, while still negative, becomes especially dangerous when combined with driving. While driving, cell phones create many distractions. Some of these distractions include: dialing on the phone, answering the phone, simply talking on the phone, and texting. These distractions constantly increase with all of the new technology available today. The smart phones in every adult and teenagers ' pockets prove deadly when used on the road. According to a government website, ""In 2011, 3,331 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver"" (Distracted Driving). Although various disturbances exist while driving, cell phone usage has proved a fatal but preventable distraction.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Drivers should not text and drive because it can lead to various life threatening situations.

According to research, it shows that we should not text and drive because texting and driving can cause a lot of distraction, such as car accidents, running someone over, running a red light and a lot more bad accidents. Many people had lost their lives while texting and driving, especially teenagers because they are young, careless and reckless and also easily distracted. Texting while driving can lead to a lot of nasty death, according to an article I read online a few years back reminded me that texting while driving can cause a lot of damages, such as life threatening damages, harm to public safety, getting a ticket, and even crashing and killing yourself, this is why most states around the US came up with a new law that can get you arrested or given a ticket for texting and driving. Although this law has been passed a lot of people still text and drive which is not good for the public safety. For example

Including kids has been killed by reckless drivers and some of those drivers usually get away without any injuries or jail time and this is not fair to the victims families. Before you think about grabbing a phone to text and drive you should think about the victims family and you should also think about your own life, because you only have one life to live so you think twice before you put yourself in a place or position that will harm yourself.

Should humans be allowed to use their cellar device while driving a truly age old question. People should be able to use their phone only if they have a car mount and are trying to use the GPS in my opinion. Otherwise pull to the side of the road if you just have to send a call or text. I truly don't understand what is that indispensable that you have to risk not only your life but others lives by picking up your phone. Just pull in to your local fast food or store and send that text that will (I assume) complete your life.

You know people have got seriously injured doing it ........

It's crazy the number of people that have died by texting and driving. Just in 2013 3,154 people were killed in distraction-related crashes. About 424,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver. In 2013, 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash. Even more telling The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. (1.6!!)

Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.

1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.

Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk. Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field.

Texting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road. Of all cell phone related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity. 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving. 74 percent of drivers support a ban on hand-held cell phone use. These are few stats that support my thesis but the stories hit closer to home for me the story of seven year old Xzavier is particularly disturbing A driver who allegedly was texting behind the wheel hit seven-year-old Xzavier Davis-Bilbo, dragging him nearly 20 feet in the process. The crash paralyzed Xzavier, and he spent four and a half months in the intensive care unit.

He won't ever walk again. That young man was only seven nowhere close to the prime years of his life. Know he can't play sports, run to the bus stop, or even jump up for a high-five because somebody was ""allegedly"" distracted by their phone.

But I can keep control i'm not them If it's one thing I know I know that people always think they can do something until they are proven wrong. Don't be that person this isn't a game this is literally life or death. Just because you haven't hit anyone yet doesn't mean your a celestial being at driving you have just been lucky. Other counter arguments might say but what I just need to do one little thing for work or school. Myself a guilty procrastinator (this is why I am making up this class) understand this argument but just be late for work or school and do it at home. Think about it what's worse killing someone by not paying attention or being late for work/school.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion t's now illegal to hold your phone while driving in the state of Georgia, part of a sweeping hands-free law that went into effect Sunday. Reading from a phone or using it to record video is banned, too, according to the Governor's Office of Highway Safety, including at stoplights. Those caught breaking the rules even tapping ""play"" on a Apple playlist while not parked face a $50 fine, which doubles upon their second time getting caught. The law, signed by Gov. Nathan Deal in May, aims to curtail driving fatalities in the state. So even if you believe a astounding driver you'll go to jail so just pull over.

The road requires your full-undivided attention. When using your phone while driving you then decrease the amount of attention you give to the road and your attention then is put into the phone. Drivers can sometimes get sidetracked and loose focus on the road when using a phone. It is easy to for an accident to happen. According to Teen Driver Source , ""Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving"". This proves that the attention span is removed from the road onto one's phone.

The road is a very busy place where a lot happens and if you don't make the right move, it can end up very badly. Not everyone can handle being able to divide their attention within the road and their phone. As it states in What Are the Dangers of Texting While Driving , "" a lot of the danger lies. With so many people on the road using highly distracting devices, the potential for accidents-and thus injuries and fatalities-is incredibly high."" This shows that statically that texting while driving is harmful in many ways.

Texting while driving reports shot as new technology increased. Proving that driving while using these new technologies was a disadvantage. According to Texting and Driving Accident Statistics ,1/4 accidents happens because of one's interaction with a cell phone. This a huge chunk in these accident statics proving the fact that interacting with a cell phone is dangerous and should not be allowed.

Driving while texting is not a good match, leading into many different and dangerous accidents.

A common killer in america today is driving while looking at your cell phone. Drivers feel like it is more important to see who texted them instead of looking at the road which causes fatal accidents. Drivers must keep the eyes on the road to look for issues and problems in the road or to see if the light is green. Which as why there are campaigns supporting no driving while texting movement with a speech ""It can wait"" signifying that any text that comes through your phone can wait.

In 2015, reportedly 391,000 injuries were caused from drivers looking at cell phones and texting while driving. The statistics shows that drivers should never be allowed to look down at their phone while driving and if caught the driver should receive a ticket. Not only are you putting yourself in danger but others as well when look down for even one second the consequences will be fatal.

Furthermore, the ""It can wait"" campaign started by the phone company AT&T in 2010 to raise awareness by spreading this message. This message was put on billboards, tv commercials, and cereal boxes. A phone company wanted drivers to know that looking at your cell phone while driving can wait for when you are not driving.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to look at their phones while driving. For it can prove quite dangerous and fatal if its done. The the text can wait until the vehicle is not is parked in a suitable parking spot. Drivers should not even have look at the phone the phone should be out of reach and out of sight of the driver while they are driving

EC74C3370379,"The use of cell phones are important to teens, children, and even adults in everyday life. Although sometimes it may be dangerous to use cellular devices while you drive, we also need them for important decisions. These reasons vary in situations where we have calls, GPS, or even change the song that you might not want to listen to at the time. Therefore, the use of cellphones while one is driving is important.

A GPS (global positioning system), helps lots of us drivers pinpoint our location, and take us from one place to another. However sometimes, we may need to change our destinations or even stop the route while under the control of a vehicle. For example, say if a lady was driving to a destination, and she started to change the location because she typed in the wrong one, that would be a good reason as to why us humans should be able to use our phones while we drive. Without us being able to use our phones to do so while we drive, we could all possibly end up at different places than we expected to be. This can go as far as to restaurants, stores, and different people houses.

Phone calls from our family, friends, and even ones who you work with are important to pick up while you're driving. To help out with these situations, you have equipment that can be placed on your window so you won't have to look away from the street to answer your device. For example, if you're receiving an important call, and you are aware that you cannot look away, this object will help you and make it easier for you to be on your phone. By doing this, this can reduce the chance of injuries and accidents by allowing someone to focus on the road and a important call at the same time.

Using your phone to change songs on the radio or your own device is significant. For example, you can have kids in the car and the song might have inappropriate words for them. Because of that, you may have to use your phone to change songs if it is off the device. Also, if the person doesn't want to listen to the songs that are playing, then the need for someone to be able to use their phone while driving is important to us.

In conclusion, the needs that we have to access our phones while driving is necessary. If we weren't able to answer calls, use the GPS, change music with the object then things would be different. We could have emergencies and problems that needs to be taken care of as soon as possible. Therefore, the human race should be able to use their phones while driving to accomplish these needs. If car manufactures could make the hands free device more safe for us drivers, everybody should be able to use their phone while driving.

Using your phone while driving is of the most common ways people die or get others killed in America. With this problem, nobody thinks that it could be them that's dead and on the news from using their phone while driving. There are countless reasons why this needs to come to an end in our society.

Many states have acted on the matter and have a hands free ban while driving. Nobody ever needs to use their phone while driving, you are supposed to be concentrated at all times while behind the wheel. One of the main reasons people are still disregarding this rule is because they're using their phone most times throughout the day and can't be without even while driving. The National safety council reports that phone use while driving causes approximately 1.6 crashes in a single year, also that 1 in every 4 car crashes has to do with phone usage while driving. Laws that were placed on these problems are slowly but surely getting rid of this problem over time.

Everybody across the nation should tell their loved ones that it is never safe to do so and should attempt to stop this by any means necessary.

Throughout many years the stats of accidents while on their phone has also increased.

Each year there are approximately 1.6 million car accidents throughout the United States. Many of those are accidents due to texting and driving, almost 400,000 injuries a year. This means 1 out of 4 car accidents are due to distractions while texting and driving. There is an average of 3287 deaths a day, just by usage of cellphones while driving. Stats show that the average age of accidents occur during young ages 17-30 years of age. In a survey, people were asked how many people text and drive and their answer was pretty shocking reporting more than 80% of the people has or done while driving.

As to all the things there are pros and cons, but in this topic, there are cons and thoughts what people think are pros. Nowadays technology is an everyday usage, us being away or not checking our phones consistently makes us feel the need to be plugged in. The majority of the scenes where people do this act end up in a car crash. Hurting yourself or even getting killed is not the only danger you take, you also put other peoples life in danger. In some cases you could hit someone hurt them really badly, or even kill them. Remembering what you did to the other person would not be your only punishment, you could go to jail and spend a long time in their just for the distraction of a couple seconds. Some of the reasons why people think its a good thing is because they feel the need to be communicated with the world just in case something bad happens or basically if something bad happens on their way and feels the need to communicate it with someone or has an emergency. There are also many more reasons why people are on their phone.

Every person has a different excuse or reason why they are texting and driving but in overall there are some that are the most common of them all. You would imagine that being on a phone call would be top 3 or 5, but it's not that commun seeing people on a phone call. One of the main reasons it's obviously texting. Another big reason is facebook, snapchat, any social media. A big reason is the camera, women just be taking pictures or videos of themselves, while on the other side guys have the trend to speed, or drive recklessly and record it to show it off. You also have people who find it entertaining to shop online or be reading the news as well as checking the weather. When people are really bored while driving or get stuck in traffic for a long period of time they are also watching videos or even movies.

In conclusion, texting and driving is really not a great idea, while it comes to texting or being on a phone call. That important text you need to answer or send can wait a couple minutes while you get to somewhere safe. Risking your life and others just to get that good quality picture is not worth it.

Everyday around the United States studies show that one out of ten people are killed by drivers that are distracted by their phones and about 1500 are critically injured. One of the most dangerous and distracting things you could possibly do is texting while driving. It is very dangerous because people who text and drive are putting extra attention onto their phone and that takes away their sight of the road which raises the chances of that person losing control of the vehicle which can cause a fatal crash that can injure the driver, injure another person or even kill the person. When a person is using their phone, their thinking about everything else besides concentrating on their surroundings and driving.

The statistics are very poor, because according to the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) in 2011 3,331 were involved in car accidents and unfortunately died because of a distracted driver on his phone, and 387,000 were severely hurt in vehicle crashes. Also according to a recent search by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute revealed that drivers who are looking at their phones are twice as likely to crash or come close to crashing than those who are paying attention to the road. These statistics are becoming more regular as people start to use their phone more and more everyday, especially those of younger ages.

For this reason it is extremely that we find different ways to terminate this terrible habit of texting and driving. To me I think that one of the best ways to cut this habit is to just turn off your phone while driving. Doing this will keep the driver focused on the road and not the buzzing and ringing the phone makes, this will also stop the driver from texting. Another way is that there are actually apps that can disable your phone while you're driving and another app that can text that person and tell them that you're driving and you'll text them back later. These are some great apps that we can use to our advantage and stop our habits of texting and driving. A great way to stop looking at your phone is that if you have a friend or another person in the car, have them check the phone while you're driving so you don't have too.

Something that is highly important is that a lot of the states have begun to pass a couple laws that orders drivers to completely stop texting and driving. But we need to be profound: none of these laws will work efficiently if the people of the society don't understand that texting while driving could have immaculate consequences, not only for the people driving but also other bystanders and innocent people. In my opinion I don't think that answering your phone is more important than your life and other people's lives. Using your phone can wait until you get where you need to be.

In this age of the world almost everyone has a phone of some kind and this includes drivers among us. Phones usually are a little distraction nothing more, but when they are driving that distraction can become deadly. In recent years the fatalities by car wreck have gone up dramatically and usually the reason these days is texting while driving. In most states if you are caught you will have some sentence or a fine of some kind. It doesn't even have to be texting that distracts a person from driving, it can be from kids in the car to the radio.

In the state of georgia there is a pretty new law called the ""hands free law""which tells drivers that they can't even touch their phones while driving. When drivers are not parked even at stoplights if their caught on their phones they will get a fifty dollar fine. The law makers made this in mind to make people not take any selfies or videos or anything like that. In reality people will try even harder and be more reckless to try and do the videos their doing. On the other hand though they say that dash cams are ok to use.

However, there are exceptions to this law such as using stereo bluetooth speakers in the car with spotify. Another exception they make is for directions apps like google maps. They also make exceptions for informing the authorities about a crime or something similar. While they said we can listen to music or streams or stuff like that we can't touch our phones while doing so. Given these reasons i don't think that drivers should be able to use their phones while driving.

There are many reasons why drivers should not use cell phones while driving vehicle. First of all, it can be very dangerous using cell phones while driving. Because when you use cell phone you get distracted with other things you are doing and things around you. When you are driving your focus should be in driving not in your phone or in any other things. There are high chances of you getting into an accident. Furthermore, getting in an accident that might really affect your bank balance and you don't want that.

The majority of humans own and operate a cell phone on a daily basis. The use of cell phones has increased throughout the years. Since the creation of phones it has made it easier to connect with a person. People also like the ability of being reached within seconds. With phones increasing there been an increase in automobile accidents. Although people think that phones are necessary for emergency people do not focus while driving. Phones are the main reason for automobile accidents, and it distracts the person while driving.

Phones have been the major cause of automobile accidents. Since it distracts the driver from the road. While using a phone it becomes harder for the driver to be completely focus. There have been studies that indicate that phones leads to crashes. ""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"" (Snyder, 2002). It shows how people's awareness and concentration decrease while being on their phone. It distracts drivers and causes them to not pay attention in moving traffic.

Even though there are many reasons for using a phone while driving there are some benefits. The main benefit is the ability of communicating within seconds. It also gives people security having a phone. In an emergency, ""having a cell phone can allow help to reach yo quickly and could possibly save lives"" (Kingston, 2019). Phone help with being connected with others. Also it makes it easier for people to send their location in an emergency. With modern phones it becomes easier to find their exact location.

In conclusion, this paper has talked about both sides of the use of phones and not using phones while driving. Even though phones give people security it also unfocus the person while driving. If people keep using phone it would increase automobile accidents. Its people's responsibility to be safe on the roads. Not only for their safety but for the safety of others.

It also takes away the perception of the road meaning everyone would be taking their eyes off the road. Social media is another liability while texting in the car.

Having the phone while driving has been a daily part of life since the phone was invented in 1972. Texting while driving has been a part of daily life since messaging was put into use on the cell phone. People urge to text and drive because once they get that first text they don't want to stop replying.

There are overall seven state with bans on cell phones in the hand while driving. No one understands why everyone all over the world desires to keep their phone in their hand at all times be it always happens.

Texting is in one of the top ten categories of the most dangerous causes of death in the U.S lone. Technology in vehicles are causing drivers to be on the phone as well taking their eyes off the road. Looking at your phone cause the driver to either hit a bystander or an animal.

There are many problems with phones being in cars and since it has been made accidents are still going to happen. Cars are being totaled, lives are being lost, and people are being injured because of phone and driving.

Cell phones have been around for years but just in the past few they have become hazardous, due to people using them in cars while operating them. They have cause death, serious injuries, and damage to personal and government property. I believe phones should not be used in vehicles without a hand-free Bluetooth system or passenger who can speak while you focus on what's in front of you. There's no age group or sex that hasn't been the cause of an accident due to their cell phones. There are many reasons technology shouldn't be allowed in vehicles while behind the wheel. There just as bad as drinking and driving. Cellphones are not okay while operating a vehicle.

Since technology has took thousands are at risk of crashing and dying. ""The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year. Texting while driving is a contributing cause in 25% of all car accidents - resulting in almost 400,000 physical injuries. Texting while driving causes 5 times as many accidents than drunk driving."" Phones have caused a chaotic distraction across America. How many more people must die before we give up on using cell phones and driving.

Not only does this distraction of cellphones while driving kill, but its costing a fortune of money that doesn't help our economy. ""Distracted Driving and Its Economic Impact Highway crashes cost $871 billion a year - $277 billion in physical damage and another $594 billion in ""societal harm,"" such as traffic congestion and lost productivity, according to the agency.""

People are constantly using their phones for different things. There are many great uses for phones. We use them for work, to contact some, even to watch videos and school research. Phones are one thing we tend to keep in our hands. However this hasn't proven to be to the best choice. NHTSA say that at least 1000 people are injured because of phone usage while driving a vehicle. In this paper I will be talking about why I think we shouldn't use cellphones while driving.

It has been proven that cell phone usage leads to deaths. Motor vehicles crash daily and usually there are many fatalities as a result of cell phone usage. Most accidents are caused by teen drivers that just have to pick up their phone while driving. The main casualties are pedestrians. In the year of 2018 alone, around 400,000 people were injured or killed. It is sad that lives are destroyed by one senseless act such as picking up a phone while driving.

Drivers that are seen and caught risk very serious punishment. The average cellphone while driving violation cost about $300 per incident. This violation also comes with a minimum of four points towards your license. This can cost you in other ways as well such as higher insurance premiums. Once you receive fifteen points your license is revoked and you are now left with finding other means of transportation. If you are found guilty of hitting someone you can face one to twenty years in prison. One second of picking up a cellphone may lead to lifetime of misery.

Driving while using a cellphone may lead to a lifelong change with many effects.

Imagine for just one moment a teen has friends or even siblings in the car with them; suddenly the phone rings. The teen looks away from the road to answer or check the text message, hits a pothole, loses control of the vehicle and in now in oncoming traffic. The vehicle crashes killing some of the passenger if not all involved.

You now have several different families that have been united by a tragedy that shouldn't have been. Drivers in the oncoming traffic may be injured as well and now have a lifetime of bills or life changing injuries and scars to hunt them of the day that some teen made a conscious choice to pick up a cellphone and drive. One moment is all it ever takes to change a life.

As you can see from the research people are affected by distracted drivers. You risk serving jail time and giving up your freedom. You can lower the causalities by simple not operating your vehicle while on a cellphone. People would worry less and feel safer if they were assured that you are being responsible and choose not to text or talk while driving.

Car crashes are the main cause of death for teens considering texting and driving is over five times more likely to cause an accident than drunk driving. With the increase in people who text and drive the risk of being on the road also increases.

Distracting driving is the cause of over half of all car accidents and is most commonly found in ages 16-19. Parents need to be teaching their children the importance of staying focused behind the wheel. Parents need to make sure that their kids are staying safe on the roads and safe around other drivers. There are multiple car trackers that parents can access to track their kids on the roads and some parents even prohibit taking a phone while driving

Future generations are continuing to text and drive regardless to the numerous laws restricting distracted driving. A lot of teens continue to text and drive even though most of them are familiar with their states driving laws. However, most teens are not aware that distracted driving is more dangerous than drinking and driving and fail to see that their phones reduce their reaction speed and hand eye coordination behind the wheel.

If the countless driving laws that restrict texting and driving don't stop you from checking your phone behind the wheel then think about the risk you are putting on yourself and all the drivers around you. For a lot of drivers who struggle staying off their phone, they can start off by simply turning off their phone and putting it in the console. Other features like Bluetooth and do not disturb mode also help drivers keep their eyes on the road.

So if you ´re thinking about responding to your friend while driving, just simply wait until you have time to respond. There is no point in risking you and everyone around you over a stupid text. Just turn the phone off and wait until you ´re done driving to ensure the safety of all drivers and decrease the risk of a fatal accident.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Texting and Driving is probably the most common in the death of teens. Not only is it dangerous to the person driving, but to all of the cars surrounding the person that is driving the vehicle. In agreement with many people, texting and driving is similar, if not Identical to drunk driving. Using your cellular device impairs your vision and causes you to lose focus on the road. We as a nation should make stricter laws enforcing ""No texting and driving"" or creating a system that disables your phone the moment you pull out of the driveway.

Even though texting and driving is a well-known known issue our young and older adult are blind to the consequences of it.

Today people are so easily distracted, so many people get in wrecks because of it. Thousands of people are killed or injured in accidents because someone had to send one more text or take one more picture. Imagine if a loved one left there house to visit for supper, and the never arrived. You would be terrified, then you get a call to be told that they have been in an accident. Of course it was by a young man distracted by his cell phone. People should not be allowed to be on there at all, not for any reason.

There are three types of distractions manual, visual, and cognitive. Manual distraction is when your hands are off the wheel and not being used to drive safely, visual distraction is when your eyes are not on the road and are instead on your cell phone, last a cognitive distraction refers to taking your mind of driving and being more focused on your cell phone. Using a cell phone while driving uses all three types, which highly increases the chances of getting into an accident. ""People are as impaired when they drive and talk on the cell phone as they are when they are intoxicated at the legal blood-alcohol limit of 0.08%."" (""Distracted Driving Facts"")

If people are as distracted as a driver that is intoxicated while using a cell phone while driving is just as if not more dangerous on the road. Also, there are most likely more people on their cell phone while driving than people under the influence of alcohol on the road.

Not only are there problems with endangering other and yourself, there are also economic problems. ""Economic losses from distracted driving could total $46 billion a year."" (""Background on: Distracted driving"").

""NHTSA released a study in May 2014 which focused on behavioral factors that contributed to 32,999 highway fatalities and 3.9 million injuries in the U.S. in 2010 the study found that those crashes cost $277 billion in economic losses and $594 billion in societal harm, for a total of $871 billion that year""

('Background on: Distracting driving""). Therefore, we are also losing billions of dollars a year due to distracting driving, Which could lead to are government increasing taxes to get that money back. Not only will it put our country in debt but maybe even people living here.

Finally, the laws for driving and being on your cell phone should be a lot more strick, and enforced stronger. We cannot have innocent people getting injured or killed every year because people are being distracted by their cell phones. Also, we can't let our country get in debt because of this either, no one wants taxes to be raised just to pay back all that money, instead let it be used for schools or other educational purposes. Last, Lets all put are put are phones away and keep the roads safe for the people of the future.

First, drivers should not be able to use their cell phones in a vehicle because it is a safety hazard. Is trading your life for a text message really worth it? Studies have shown that many deaths and injuries on the road are caused by distracted drivers. Usually the distractions end up being simple texts and notifications that can wait. Better to respond late than never.

Drivers should be banned from using cell phones while driving because it is comparable to drunk driving. Now that is said because both distracted and drunk drivers share the same trait. They both do not show enough mental focus to manage a vehicle.

Phones should not be allowed to be touched or played on as you are on the roads so that you are fully aware of what's going on in your surroundings and also not taking your eyes off the roads. Texting while driving may ruin yours or another person's life.

There are a lot of risks that could happen and put your life or someone else's lives in danger. Most people pick up the phone because they say it's important, but even then the phone would be a distraction. Take a moment to sit and think about how many accidents occur because of a text, now think about in old times when texting while driving was not a problem at all.

Authorities put down strict detailed laws about having your phone in your hand while driving. Each offence doubles every time you get caught but this law was hardly effective because no one is taking the safer advice to insure the safety of yourself and others on the roads. The fines would turn into something more serious and if you got into a wreck, injuring another person you could more than likely spent some jail time.

I know phones shouldn't be allowed to be messed with while you are driving because imagine if it were you in the situation and getting into a wreck all because someone was paying attention to their phone and not the road. You could lose it all in a blink of an eye or you could make someone else lose everything, don't be that person because either one there are causes and effects to your actions even if you didn't get hurt , you probably hurt someone else that has family that loves them like crazy.

Because I have brought up the hands-free law, let us discuss it. Drivers are not to have any mobile devices in their hands. They're required to use: speakerphone, earpiece, bluetooth, or an electronic watch. While driving a driver can not send messages, read social media, or make videos. These reasons cause accidents. If a driver is: reporting a crash, medical emergency, fire, suspicious activity, or hazardous road conditions is the driver allowed to use their mobile devices.

The vast majority of car crashes in Georgia have been in rear-end crashes, single-car crashes and crashes by drivers from 15 to 25 years-old. There are 15 states that have passed the hands-free law. In those fifteen states, they have saw a 16 percent decrease in fatalities.

It is reported that cell phone use while driving leads to millions of crashes each year, and that's sometimes due to drivers trying to use their phones at any given time of the day, whilst behind a moving automobile. Even though smartphones have made it easier for people to stay connected, there's no need for letting the ins and outs of smartphones to run their lives. The distraction rates of cell phones are alarmingly high, given the fact that the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Those reasons stand alone, as to why drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a moving vehicle.

Recent general cell phone statistics states that 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Operating a vehicle requires someone to be fully focused on their surroundings, as they are not only driving for themselves, but every pedestrians and motorists. Texting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road and that's all it can take for and accident to happen within the blink of an eye or even worse, a causality.

Using a cellphone while driving can be hazardous to everyone's health, even their lives. ""Arrive alive, don't text and drive"" is a common slogan that can be seen almost everywhere. Driving is already risky because most people don't know how to drive or they drive while intoxicated which makes using cellphones while driving ten times worse because it can be avoided. Using a cellphone while driving should not be allowed because it is the root cause of many accidents that we have today.

To start off, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating vehicles because it can cause car crashes. Most car crashes nowadays happen because of someone texting while driving. Teenagers and others cause crashes because of being distracted. According to ""edgarsnyder. com"", 1.6 million crashes are caused by texting while driving. No matter how bad one needs to answer a text, one shouldn't text back. A solution would be to pull over so that accidents can be prevented.

Additionally, studies have shown that driving while talking or texting on a cellphone is extremely dangerous and puts drivers at a greater risk of crashing into others. An extreme example would be if a person is walking across a crosswalk at a light intersection. The driver is approaching the light when the light was first green when he look then he started texting,while doing that the light turned red,so the person walked along the crosswalk by the time the driver looked up it was too late to stop on brakes. This is a prime example of being distracted while driving. It's sad but true while driving and texting it takes your attention off the road to see what's in front of you. According to ""braunslaw. com"", it states that the most common reasons pedestrians get hit is because,driving while texting or intoxicated harms others.

Lastly, it is important to note that driving while using a cellphone is illegal in most countries. It is also unlawful to drive in Georgia while using a cellphone. Georgia has a law called the hand held law. This law enables the use of cellphones without it being in your hand. The fines are steep, however, many drivers still use cellphones while driving. There are plenty of consequences for driving while using a cellphone. One is points on your license which means if you get a certain amount of points your license they can be took. Secondly you will have to take classes called ""mandatory road safety class""why do all this when you can just stay off your cellphones while driving.

Although some may argue that you should use your cellphone while driving, people are taking a risk while using their cellphones. According to the law, one's cellphones should be used for one reason only, to call 911. In this instance only, one can agree that cellphones, can be utilized.

To conclude, there is no question that using a cellphone while driving is a major distraction. Besides, being the law, everyone who drives should realize that being distracted while on the road puts everyone at risk!   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8
B67C452749B8,"Cell Phones have been a very big problem relating to car accidents for the past few years, especially when it comes to teens. Cellphones are so dangerous when it comes to driving, so dangerous that they are sometimes the cause of deaths. Cell Phones shouldn't be used when driving or operating a vehicle. Cell Phones have especially been the cause of many teens deaths over the past years, this is why you always see so many signs on the freeway or even on billboards saying to not use your phone it is better to read a message later than to be dead or the cause of someone else's death.

Cell Phones have caused so many deaths or even fatal car accidents over the past. In an article by teensafe. com it states that, ""In 2015, 391,000 injuries were caused in distracted driving related accidents''. This means that in 2015 there were a total of 9 people killed by distracted driving a day. Imagine you driving down the road not even knowing what the person next to you behind you may be doing, maybe their texting on their phone, answering a call, or even trying to set up their GPS, and then all of a sudden boom your into a major car accident that could be the death of you. Cellphones are very dangerous and will continue to be throughout the years and coming.

So many teens dream of having their own cars, some are lucky enough to actually be gifted it to them by their parents, the only scary part about it is that some teens don't understand the responsibility behind driving a vehicle without their parents or having someone to make sure they are driving safely. In an article posted by teenssafe. com it states,"" Each day,?11 teens? die in crashes caused by texting and driving."" That means 11 teens are dead each die due to a simple text sent or received while driving. Imagine if you had a teen child who drove their own vehicle, they could fall into being those 11 people who die a day, honestly anyone could fall into that category it's not just only teens.

Using your phone while driving is life risking and very dangerous, especially when the person behind the wheel is irresponsible. Just imagine losing a loved one due to someone who couldn't wait to send a text message till they go to their destination. In my opinion a cellphone or any form of technology should be out of anyone who is operating a vehicle hand. Maybe you wait to get home or wherever you must go, to send a message it's always better safe than sorry. Not only are the people operating the vehicle the ones in danger but sometimes even the passengers or the person in the other cars can be harmed or sometimes even end up dead.

In conclusion cellphones should be banned from being used while driving. It causes harm and sometimes even death to the one operating the vehicle or the people around him. Me as a teen agree with phones being banned, no one should put their lives or the lives of others at risk just because they couldn't wait to send a message. Others may say that people need their phones to contact people for work or children may have to contact their parents while at home, but people need to understand that earphones exist now that help you answer your phone that having it in your hand and of course texting can always wait, if its so important why not pull over instead or just a simple phone call. In the end parents should make sure their children are responsible while driving and adults should know better than to use their phone while driving.            ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Using your phone while driving, everyone knows it's illegal to do this. Using your phone while driving is dangerous thing to do because your looking at the road. You can't see where you're going or what's in front of you. This doesn't stop people from being on their phones though. In some cases though being on your phone for an emergency can help you be aware of where you need to be at that time.

Being on your phone posses a lot of danger for you and everyone around you. One person alone can cause a car rekt if they're on their phone. Because of this laws are put in place, but sometimes people will ignore those laws and be on their phone anyway. Causing a car crash or themselves panic a bit and speed up and nearly hit the car in front of them. Pretty much when you're driving, don't be on your phone because if you hear a car rev their engine you might think that the traffic is finally moving and hit the car in front of you because you were on your phone not paying attention.

You should have very low phone usage since you're driving. If someone calls you while you're driving and it's a emergency, you shouldn't stay on the phone for long. Staying on the phone will cause you to focus more on the phone, without you being careful like you normally would when you're driving, because you're trying to get somewhere fast since it's an emergency.

Instead of being careless of others around you, take your time when trying to get to that emergency, be mindful of what you're doing. You should never be on your phone and drive even if it's an emergency because you're caring about the other people around you, you just care to get to that emergency fast.

In some cases though being on your phone can be 'helpful' in a way. Let's say you're on your phone and you get a text, you're going to look at the text regardless even if you're driving. When looking at the text, make sure you've stop stopped somewhere to look at it or in this case when you're driving, look to see if any cars are around you. Obviously texting while driving is the worst thing you can do. So when you're going to text while you drive make sure you look to see how many cars are around, stay mindful of your surroundings, and if possible try to find a spot and stop so can see the text without endangering anyone else because you're not looking at the road.

In conclusion to being your phone when driving. You shouldn't do it even if it's an emergency or you just want to check your social media feed. You put yourself and everyone around you in danger because you're paying attention. If you decide to go on your phone though make sure you're stopped or at least almost no one is around you. Pretty much just stay off your phone when driving to keep yourself and others safe.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

There is no doubt that with how advanced technology has become in the past few years or so people have really advanced the technological possibilities. People have now started to make some of the AI's (artificial intelligence) like Alexa and Google Home. There are even some cars that allow you to ask it questions in order to find out the weather or finding the fastest route to take to work. Along with all of these technological advancements comes the ability to hook the phone up to a car using bluetooth. Now, should drivers be able to use their phones in the car while driving.

There are some really good uses for using the bluetooth phone hookup. For one in Georgia people are not allowed to drive if they have their phone in their hand. This is where the bluetooth phone hookup comes in handy because you can do in the car phone calls to work or to somewhere else. This feature can come in really handy because if someone takes a day off of work and someone from their work calls them and starts to ask questions they can answer those questions right then and there. That way if someone was ever needed to give someone some advice in their place of work they could just click a button and give them the advice over the phone.

There is also another use for the phone hookup to the car feature and that is so that someone can get notified if they do happen to have a family emergency. This is so that if someone does happen to have a family emergency and they are in the car already all they have to do is drive over to where the family emergency actually is. This is so that you can get notified if something bad does happen to someone's family member they won't have to wait until they get home to find out what happened.

Once again being that when they do find out instead of having to leave the house again to go and see what happened because this person is actually out and about all they have to do is go to the place of the emergency. This may be one of the sadder ways that a phone can be used for while driving but it still is one of the more important things.

The next reason for why people should be able to use their phone while driving is what if someone has to call the police. Using the bluetooth phone hookup feature that most cars have nowadays someone can call up the police and say that they need assistance with something. For instance let's say that someone has a very strong feeling that they are being stalked on the way home from work or somewhere else so they can then call the police for their assistance. This can also be a real life saver because this can also be used if someone's water breaks on the way to the hospital that way someone can go ahead and let the hospital know what is happening so someone won't have to wait. So, in short, phones can be used to save someone's life.

Phone's have been useful since the time of their invention. From the ability to be able to talk to people from a long distance away to making sure that people can keep in touch with their work life. Next, being able to keep in touch with the family making sure to be kept in the loop if something bad does happen. Lastly, being able to call the police and other emergency services to save lives. Phones are a necessity in day to day life which includes on the road.   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8
65CD7CF594DB,"It has been statistically documented that cellphone-related accidents are increasing at an alarming rate. The usage of phone apps, texting, GPS mapping for directions, and social media sites have caused new laws and penalties to be passed due to cellphone-related injuries and deaths. In my opinion, drivers cell phone usage should be limited while driving with the usage of features such as hands-free options which should be mandatory.

According to the National Safety Council, 2019 Texting-While-Driving Report; the average cellphone related deaths is roughly 1,600,000 accidents per year. The top two most common distractions of automobile drivers are: talking on a cell phone and sending text messages.

Nationally the state of Georgia ranks number four by Expert Market research (www. expertmarket. com) with an average of 132.7 Fatal Crashes Caused by Cell Phones.

However, the number of accidents caused by cell phone use while driving is severely under- reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) (www. nhtsa. gov/distracted-driving). The issues of cellphone related problems with Fatal Crashes Caused by Cell Phones continue to grow when you consider the victims who have either died or experienced severe injuries by vehicle operators who have struck bystanders due to a simple message or post.

Even though the statistics cause concern advocates for public safety feel that cell phone use while driving can be lifesaving for onsite emergencies, roadside assistance, and even responding to Amber Alerts. Both sides have valid arguments that have increased major phone carriers and company's like Apple Inc. have creating phone features such as voice activated Hands-free Calling, Do Not Disturb, and Disable While Driving to help minimize the possibility of anything cell-phone related occurring,

In conclusion, I feel that in the future cell phones and automobiles including cargo trucks alone will have driver algorithm and functions that will help decrease problems with cell phone- related driver issues. I do not feel that it is necessary to completely eliminate operating a cell phone while driving in case of a emergency especially health related or to even report kidnapping & human-trafficking which is a huge problem for the state of Georgia and nationally. Drivers need to be more mindful and obey the laws or be penalized by the new laws meant to protect people.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Each year thousands of people die in car crashes because of the use of cell phones while driving. The number of these deaths increase with every year. This is a major problem, especially for teenage drivers who are new to the road. Teenagers are not experienced enough and can also be easily distracted by their phones. While driving, if not paying full attention to the road, a teenager or anyone else could easily crash or get into a dangerous situation such as running through a red light because they were talking on the phone. Many states have started to see an increase in the number of people who text and drive and this directly contributes to the growing number of car accidents. Because of this, many states, including Georgia have taken action in an effort to reduce the growing number of wrecks due to cell phone usage. However, it seems that these set rules are not as strict as they should be and many states are quite lenient with the laws. Cell phone use needs to be more restricted while driving any type of automobile.

The first reason cell phones should not be used while driving and should be more restricted is because it is actually illegal in the United States. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 14 states have prohibited all drivers from using handheld devices while driving. Additionally, 46 states have banned texting and driving. State legislatures have seen the exponential growth in texting and driving along with the increase of automobile accidents. Therefore, the majority of the states have made the decision to pass laws that prohibit handheld devices such as cell phones. Many people who use their cell phones while driving have tried to state that they have no problem focusing on their driving while also using their technology. They have said that they have used cell phones multiple times while driving and have not caused one accident. However, researchers have proven that a person who uses their cell phone in any form while driving, is 2.8 times more likely to get into a wreck. Texting while driving is even more dangerous with it being 23.2 times more likely to get someone in an accident. Just because it does not happen to everyone one, does not mean that thousands of people have not lost their lives because of this problem.

Thousands of innocent adults, teens and children lose their lives everyday because of the actions and choices of those around them. When teens or children are in a car with an adult who is using their cell phone while they drive, that adult is putting those kids' lives at risk.

48% of kids in their younger teenage years have been in a vehicle while the adult driver was texting. In addition to that, 1,600 kids in that age range lose their lives every year because of people using their phones while they drive. Cars are amazing innovations that can get anyone to where they need to be quickly and efficiently. However, put them in the hands of someone who is irresponsible and a safe car becomes a potential weapon.

This is why cell phone use needs to be more restricted. Using a cellphone while driving gives the driver inattention blindness and also a slower reaction time. These are symptoms of drunk driving as well. If one would not drive with their children in the car while they are intoxicated, one should not text and drive or use their cell phone at all. A quick text or peek at social media, is not worth an innocent life.

On a lighter note, another reason cell phone use should be restricted is because it will save money. Drivers who do not use their phones while they are driving have financial benefits even if they do not realize it. Imagine all the traffic tickets, accidents and increased insurance rates that every person who uses their cell phone while driving has to deal with. If cell phones are more restricted, people will save so much money. While it does depend on which insurance company a driver is signed with, it has been shown that if one is involved with car accidents due to cell phone use, their insurance rates rise potentially up to 82%. Getting pulled over and handed a ticket more than once, means that person is now considered a high risk driver. High risk drivers have increased insurance or in extreme cases no insurance at all. If the insurance bill increases to be too high and that person cannot afford to pay it off, then the insurance company will sometimes repossess the car.

Any type of cell phone use while driving is extremely dangerous and quite irresponsible.

Restricting cell phones to a higher degree would have many benefits. While plugging in a phone to listen to music is acceptable as long as the phone is not touched afterwards, texting someone back when it is not urgent or checking Snapchat, is not worth taking an innocent life. It is also not worth the driver's life. Car accidents and wrecks will happen to everyone, everywhere regardless of cell phone use or not. There are many other things that can distract drivers. However, not all of those things can be restricted but cell phones can. The rule needs to be enforced more. Once that happens, while wrecks will still happen, it will greatly lower the risk of more people getting hurt because their cell phone controls them and their actions.

That one text you send can change your whole life in one second. That one phone call or that one text message is not worth your life.

The only reason that you should be on your phone is to look at GPS, anything that is not an emergency should not be important. Therefore, that mean the phone is not no where near more important than your life.

Cell phones can be a big distraction in your driving skills. The minute you look down at your phone is the minute your life can be taken away.

Knowing how society is today and knowing how technology plays a major role in some people's lives, I believe that people should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. The people in this society are so addicted to their cellphones, it can be super dangerous to be using them while driving. The more time people use their cellphones while driving, the less aware they will be of their surroundings on the roads, which can typically lead to more accidents. Drivers should always stay focused on the road and nothing but the road. Here are some reasons why.

One of the main reasons why you should not use a cell phone while driving is to be able to focus more on where you are going and your surroundings. The use of a cell phone can get you distracted, which could lead to you getting lost or it could lead to a fatal car accident. It is very dangerous to be distracted while you are driving. The quickest few seconds you take just to look at your phone can be risking the lives of others and yourself. To prevent that from happening, you should keep your phone on silent so it would not be a distraction to you.

Another reason why you should not be on your phone while driving is because of the safety of others. When you are driving with other people in the car, you should always consider their safety, as well as yours. Once you start distracting yourself from the road, you are putting the other passengers lives in danger. Not only should you consider the safety of your passengers, but you should also consider the safety of the people on the same road as you. You have to be cautious of the pedestrians and the other drivers on the road.

Most of the states are making it illegal to text and drive. States are making this an illegal law because of the amount of deaths caused by texting and driving. Making texting and driving illegal will help decrease the number of deaths from this cause. Getting caught texting and driving can result in getting fined.

In conclusion, there are many reasons why you should never text and drive. It is the most dangerous thing to do while driving. Even though it is very dangerous to be on your phone while driving, there are many alternatives. Instead of driving, you can pull over to the side of the road and respond to your message. Another solution is to give your phone to the passenger in the passenger's seat so they can respond to any messages. The most safest solution is to turn it off and put it in the middle console of your car, that way, you wouldn't be tempted to even look at it. That is why I believe people should not text and drive.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

As big of a deal a they may be they are creating a big problem in the united states. Texting and driving, and calling and driving. There are certain function and tools you can use to prevent this from happening. And a big fraction of accidents on the road are caused by cell phones. I will explain what we can do to keep this from happening.

The 21st century is definitely the century of technology. We have all of this new tech being invented. Electric cars, jetpacks, and including our cell phones. Cell phones have come a long way since they were invented in 1973. We used to only be able to use them in homes and businesses. But once they were mobilized society and the way we lived changed forever. That means that they could be taken anywhere and everywhere. This was only the start of something that was great and horrendous.

The problem that they were creating was called texting and driving. Texting and driving is a dangerous task. Its is so dangerous that in some states it is illegal to have a cell phone in your hand while you're driving a motorized vehicle. That is how much of a problem that texting and driving has caused. Same with calling and driving. They are both equally as dangerous when it comes to driving. Cell phones have caused numerous injuries and casualties. Cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6million crashes each year. 1 of every 4 cars accidents are caused by using a cell phone while operating the motor vehicle.

What makes it worse is that nowadays we have tools and function built into our phones so we don't have to have them in our hands to use them. We now have bluetooth headphones so that we can answer calls without using our hands. We also now have handsfree modes that are built into our phones. Nowadays we really have no excuse to be hands on with our phones. There are a multitude of ways we can use them so we don't end up getting ourselves hurt in the process.

In all, choosing to text and drive or to not text and drive is purely a personal safety choice. Texting/Calling and driving while have the phone in your hand will forever be dangerous.

Phones and driving is a terrible idea due to the amount of injury and danger it brings. Driving while occupied on the phone is a threat to yourself and others because your multitasking. This can cause risk because when your focusing on 2 things you may get distracted and forget about the other. If i am texting and driving and i glance down to read a text paragraph thats 3-7 seconds my eyes are off the road. Thats 3-7 seconds of disaster waiting to strike. All someone has to do is get over while im no looking or a light turn red then boom disaster strikes. And i can guarantee you that insurance won't be on your side in that situation.

In 2016 cell phones were responsible for 421,000 accidents around the united states alone. That's the equivalent of 5 dallas cowboy stadiums full. Out of that number 253 were fatal accidents. This was all in one year. The studies are evident occupied driving is a terrible and destructive habit that americans are responsible for starting. On average the american spends 24 hours week on their phones. Thats a day out of every week spent glued to a virtual reality.

You should think about other people before you get in your car. Is being on a phone more import than your life and others lives?

Every year approximately almost 22% of Americans are mostly teens who are involve in crashes. While being on a phone talking or texting. You will be better off walking than texting and driving. Texting and driving can be worse than drinking and driving sometimes. The difference is that you have a person that's drunk person that's trying to get home while drunk. But on the other hand you have a person that's on they're phone and driving, but is not paying attention .

Almost every second in different countries you have somebody getting in a accident because of people like this. Since the development of technology this has made the death rate go up. People has been paying more attention to they're phones since phones came out. Not saying phones is a problem, people just don't know what to choose what's important these days.

In today's society, the world depends on technology for nearly everything. It's used to communicate, do research, play games and even to give us directions when we are driving and lost. Everywhere you look you are likely to see technology in use, with one of the most popular devices being cellphones. This is easy to explain, as stated above, they are used for communication, access to internet, games and more. However, there are some instances when cell phones are a threat to our safety. Though cell phones are useful in some capacity, in most scenarios people should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving.

To begin, one of the main issues with cell phones like many other technology devices, cell phones are a distraction when you need to focus on the environment around you. While driving, the most important rule is to be completely attentive to your environment. Others may argue that people are able to multitask and can still focus on the road while using a phone.

Though this may have some truth, the problem comes when the cell phone distracts your attention from something that has happened on the road and/ or affects your reaction time. For example, image you are driving while texting a friend and you look up and notice a car swerving into your lane. With only one hand on the will you try to move over to avoid the car, but without full control of the wheel you end up turning too far and crashing into the another car. Even if you were able to drop your phone and put both hands on the wheel, by that time the car has already crashed into you. In this situation, an accident could have been avoided if you had been paying attention and acted quickly before the car came to close. Driving is already dangerous enough as something could go wrong in a matter of seconds, using a cell phone at the same time would only make it even more difficult in most cases.

In addition, despite popular beliefs, most people don't do well when trying to multitask. For driving, this means that if you are on your phone you are paying attention to the phone and not the road, even if it is just for a few seconds. But what could happen in a few seconds, some may ask? For example, you are driving to a friend's house through a populated neighborhood. You see that the street is all clear and take this chance to text your friend and tell them that you are close. At that exact moment at child runs into the street chasing a ball they had been playing with. By the time you look up it is too late to stop and you end up hitting the child. This accident could have been avoided if you had been paying one-hundred percent attention to the road. Even in situations when the problem is not another driver or pedestrian, there are still many things you should be paying attention to on the road. For instance, image the same example as above except there is no child in the road. The street is clear and you pull out your phone to text. At that moment you notice a pothole and swerve to avoid it and end up running over the sidewalk and straight into a tree. Yet again, this accident could have been avoided if you had been focusing on the road.

Although in most situations, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving, there are two scenarios which when it may be need. The first situation is when the driver is lost and needs directions. In this situation, using the phone for directions is necessary, however this should be done in a certain way. When this is the situation the driver should use some type of hands free device to hold the phone so that they can keep both hands on the wheel at all times. The other scenario is in case of emergency. For example, you are driving on the highway and see a bad accident occur but you are unable to stop and do anything. In this situation it is appropriate to use your phone to call the police so that they can get there as soon as possible to help anyone who may have been injured in the accident. Outside of incidents such as these drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity.

To summarize, with the exception of being lost or in case of emergency, drivers should not be able to use cell phone while on the road as it not only puts themselves in danger, but those around them as well. In today's society, there have been countless accidents as a result of texting and driving. When you learn how to drive, the first thing you do is put on your seatbelt, why?

Because safety is the highest priority. If drivers are allowed to freely use their phones when on the road, that means that safety is no longer the highest priority and countless lives would be put at risk of injury and even death. If a text message, call, game or anything else is that important it will still be there for you to respond to after you have gotten to your destination safely.

D8A6A717C7A3,"Texting and driving has become more of a problem as time goes on. With the large growth of technology use, almost everyone has access to a phone while driving. There are many reasons you should choose not to be on your phone while driving. Not only is it extremely dangerous for yourself but also anyone else on the road. It's something that should be taken very seriously. You should not be able to use a cell phone in any way while operating a vehicle, and if caught should result in punishment.

Texting and driving is a huge problem in day to day life. As people get too comfortable driving the more it starts to happen. People think they can get away with it which isn't always the case. Driving a vehicle is something that might seem easy if you have been driving for a long time, but is still a very dangerous task. It's something that requires your undivided attention no matter how long you've been doing it. Not only are you putting yourself at risk of harm but also everyone else on the road.

The National Safety Council says that using a phone while driving results in 1.6 million crashes each year. With 390,000 injuries and 6,000 deaths annually. 1 out of 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. This is even more dangerous than being under the influence of alcohol when driving. There are punishments in place to help prevent people from doing this.

Laws on texting and driving vary by state. In Georgia if you are caught you're faced with a $50 fine with a point on your license for first offense. $100 for the second time and two points. $150 for the third time and 3 points. This can lead to your license being suspended if you have accumulated 15 points (4 if under the age of 21). These are just the lesser punishments, if you get in a wreck while on your phone it can become much worse with up to a year in jail time.

With these consequences and taking the risk of putting yourself and other people in harm's way isn't worth being on your phone. It's better to just wait until you're not driving. And as this issue continues to rise more and more it's important to be careful and watch out for other people that might be distracted on their phone while driving.

On the road as well. The main reason people get in a car accident while on their phone

Is because they are not paying attention to anything so they could exceed the speed limit or takes their eyes off the road. If you need to use your phone you could pull over

But that's not an option for most people because they are always in a hurry.

Most people believe that they are ok or doesn't affect them when they us their phone and drive and they over estimate their driving ability and that's what leads to a car accident that may cost you your life. when a person hits someone the first thing the

Person in the wrong would say is ""I never saw him/she ""or ""He came out of nowhere"".

It's hard to understand how you didn't see anyone while driving because you were on your phone when your eyes should be on the road.

Therefore, people don't understand not to drive and use your phone but somehow

They still proceed to use them like they don't care.

Every year, there are 1.6 million car crashes due to cell phone use while driving. (https://www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html) One out of every four crashes is, all in all, caused by somebody being so distracted and sucked in by their phone. When are people going to realize that using any kind of cellular device while driving is a distraction so dangerous, it could cost others their lives, as well as their own? Is sending that one text really worth dying over? People need to see the dangers of using cell phones while driving. It has become such a giant problem, and it needs to be stopped. Drivers should be prohibited from handling or looking at their phones while driving.

Teens are the most likely case of texting and driving. Nowadays, teens feel the need to always have their eyes glued to their phone screen. Who can blame them? Social media and texting are some of the main methods of communication in 2018. On the contrary, teens are irresponsible and choose to catch up with their friends online at the wrong time. On top of being inexperienced drivers, they are constantly taking their eyes off the road to check their cell phone. Teens especially should be taught the dangers of using phones while driving; how one text can change not only your life, but everybody else's around you.

Everybody has been late to work, school, or anything else at some point in their lives. They are rushing and they go out the door, driving a little faster than they normally would, trying to get to their destination on time. Now, add a phone to this situation. According to the Edgar Snyder law firm, texting while driving has a ""400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road."" (https://www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html) Alongside being in a hurry, the person who is late to work is now endangering themselves and others.

What if, maybe, the person driving was not the culprit of using phones while driving? Already in a rush, they are trying to get to work on time, and they are struck by a careless driver, who was changing the song they were listening to on their phone.

Every year, with the advance in use of technology, there are more and more accidents involving phones. ""In 2015, 391,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers."" Of those people, 3,477 died. That may seem like a small chunk, but those are lives that did not need to be lost. Simply putting your phone down and waiting could have saved somebody. In schools, there needs to be an organized plan to teach kids about these kinds of dangers. This needs to happen soon, especially for high schoolers, who are at the age where they are learning to drive, and also the most involved in technology and their phones.

To conclude, drivers, no matter the age or experience, should not be able to use their phones at all while driving. There have been too many countless deaths and injuries related to phones and driving. This can be prevented by implementing a system in schools to teach about the dangers of phone use while driving. There should also be a course in Drivers Education, whether online or in schools, strictly on phone use. Any person of any age should be able to learn the dangers of texting, changing music, taking pictures, etc. while behind the wheel.

D5F73CFE97CC,"In today's world there are many people that text and drive or talk on the phone and drive at the same time, but should those people even do that? Texting and driving are just as dangerous as drinking and driving. In my opinion, I don't think people should text and drive because it can cause many dangerous scenarios. Approximately 9 people are killed and over 1,000 people are injured every day in the United States due to people texting and driving. During the daylight hours, an average of 660,000 people is using electronic devices while driving.

When you text and drive you to put not only your life at risk but others around the environment as well because you take your eyes off the road and are not paying attention. The average person focuses their attention away from the road for about 4.6 seconds. Also when you talk on the phone your reaction time is the same as if you are under the influence of alcohol. In addition, if you get caught texting and driving your license can get suspended and or get penalty points.

Texting and driving can be very dangerous because you have to look at your phone and your eyes are not paying attention to the road, and since your eyes are off the road you can end up hitting another car, and or end up causing death. When you text and drive you are distracted and not paying attention to your surroundings. When you're not paying attention to the road and your surroundings you are not aware of what's around you, objects such as humans, animals, walls or any other objects that can cause you to get hurt. This is a big reason why texting and driving are bad and also illegal.

Additionally, when you crash your car because of texting and driving the car insurance is very expensive, and if your insurance company finds out that you wrecked your car from texting and driving your car insurance will be even more expensive. So if you don't want to pay a lot more money for a car wreck don't text and drive. Furthermore, monetary fines for texting and driving can range from $20-$500 depending on which state you are in. also, you can get criminal misdemeanor charges in class B or class C. or if you injure or kill someone, jail time may be imposed.

In conclusion, texting and driving do not need to occur. Don't do anything else in your car, only watch the road and both of your hands on the wheel. People need to realize how much danger you are putting yourself and others around you in too. Would you rather die on the road texting I am going to be there or actually make it?

Even though we all know being on the phone and driving is extremely dangerous. People should not physically use their phones while they're driving.

Using your phone and driving doesn't only put the driver in danger, but the passengers as well. A life should be way more important than a text message or notification. A person could look away for a split second and a crash could happen right in that moment. When someone is on their phone and driving they're very much capable of drifting off. Just a minor slip up could turn into a major accident.

If an accident was to occur due to someone being on their phone while driving, that person is more than likely going to be the one responsible. Distracted driving has become more normal in today's society. Most people often use their phones while driving because they feel capable of doing so. That same reason could be a cause of a death due to an accident. It would be much easier to avoid accidents if everyone started off their phones while driving.

That's what's using their phones while driving comes into place. They might just be experienced but those around them may not be. Those around them just might crash because they were the one in their phone.

Phones, specifically, have combined the use of regular land-line telephones, global positioning systems, and internet access into a small neat package. The list of benefits from such devices seems almost infinite however not many are able to recognize some serious repercussions.

In the year 2017, it was reported that there were a total of 3,166 deaths due to distracted driving (Currin). The United States Department of Transportation (USDT) declared the average time spent looking at a phone while driving is around five (5) seconds. USDT further states, ""At 55 mph, that's like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed.""

Sergeant Clayton Richardson details in, ""Distracted Driving and the Police Officer,"" how states are actively putting sanctions in place against the use of cell phones on the roads. 21 states, including Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, have put sanctions against distracted driving in relation to cell phone usage.

While there may be pressing reasons for drivers to be on their cell phones however no reason is more important than the lives of drivers, passengers and pedestrians as well.

A89E289BE3EC,"Today's society highly revolves around internet use and it can get to a point where people are using it everywhere and anytime they want. Using it while driving can be extremely dangerous therefore i highly disagree that phones can be used while driving because not only are you putting yourself at risk but you are putting other people's life at risk as well. One error can lead to anyone's death and putting yourself at major risk. That's some reasons why i disagree that we should text and drive.

People are putting a lot at risk by texting while driving because your not gonna be as focused on the road as if your texting on the phone. Doing that can highly put risk a lot of people's life due to the fact of your reaction time is minimized. Say your driving on the freeway 60 mph and your on the phone your gonna be 50% on the road and 50% on the phone. Doing that puts so much risk and could potentially end someone's life.

Death can be something that can happen if your texting and driving because not being focused can always lead to worst scenarios. There are model predicting that text messaging are involved in 6-16% of all car accidents in the US. With that being said there's a chance an accident happening and that's very dangerous. People just need to put there phones down and focus more on the road before it potentially ends bad for them.

Some ways of preventing this would be to tell family, friends and organizations to which you belong about the importance of driving without distractions. Also Take information to your kids' schools and ask that it be shared with students and parents. Doing this will be so much awareness and can help so much when texting and driving and safe many lives. No one should text and drive and if you need to text or talk on the phone, pull over to a safe place. Set rules for yourself and help someone out !

With that being said there are ways of preventing an accident and helping out lives. I disagree with driving with phones because it can cause many life changes and that is very painful. Putting your phone to the side is safer than keeping it with you non stop. Therefore in my opinion there should be a law or ban of any types of phones in a car.

Phones and driving have been a big problem and continue to be a big problem. Just one careless person looking down to read a text could result in multiple deaths. People don't fully grasp the reality of the danger that is really there, people think that oh it would never happen to them or that they're too good a driver for them to hit someone. But just looking down at your phone could end things for you and others.

Could be someone walking, another car, a child, an animal, anything. When you take your yes off the road then it distracts you from your surroundings, from where you're going, from whats infront of you.

There are already laws in place to try and stop people from being on their phones while behind the wheel, but some people just don't care and some people think that they could just never hit someone or something. Cell phones should not be a priority while driving, you are trying to get from point A to point B. You should be able to wait till you are out of the car to answer a text or check social media. If it is urgent then simply pull over as soon as you can and get to it. But you should never be on your phone behind the wheel.

There has been many deaths related to cell phones and driving and with people becoming more and more addicted and attached to their phones and social media its harder and harder to get people off their phones. People are so attached that they are on their phones all the time not caring where they are.

I believe we should have harsher punishments and better ways to detect people on their phone. Maybe a harsher punishment for just being seen holding it behind the wheel will make some people think twice.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
37334F0182B8,"The prompt is talking about if people are able or unable to use their cell phone while they are driving or when they are at a stop light or stop sign. I think people shouldn't be able to use their cell phone, the reason why is because most of the time car crashes happened when people are using their cell phone but, I think people are able to use their cell phone when they are at a stop light. When people are using their cell phones that what causes a car crash. The way people get in a car crash is when they driving and looking at the cell phone to text people back they look away for a good amount of second that a car can switch to their line and because the person on their cell phone they would see in till it is to late. people shouldn't use their cell phone because most death are because or the cell phone. But at a stop light I think people are able to look at their cell phone and use it because you are not moving or anything you are just in one spot, so you won't hit anything and you do got time to use their cell phone because the light takes forever to change to green. So to me I disagree that using your cell phone while driving should be a no go because that's how much of the people get a ticket or get into a car crash that sometimes they get hurt or they hurt others so that's why it think driving while using your phone should be banned. But I agree that if you are at a stop light you are able to use your for because you are in one places you are not moving at all and also the light takes time to change so you can go that why I agree that it is the only time to see who texted you and text back.

Do you think it is worth it to look at your phone while driving? The zebra conducted a national survey of young drivers to determine their perception of texting and driving. 36% of respondents aged 18-24 admitted to texting while driving. Using your phone while operating a vehicle is dangerous and should never be done.

One reason why you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is because you could put yourself at risk of injuring yourself or someone else. Say your driving and you hear your phone's notifications going off you feel the urge to pick up your phone just to see what it is out of curiosity and you Know you shouldn't pick up your phone because you are driving but you still pick it up anyway. That one moment you look up to see a person crossing the street and are lucky enough to press your foot on the brakes in time to stop in the intersection. Consider yourself lucky as you could've injured that person. Things like this can happen which is why you should be more careful when driving.

Second reason why you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is because you should consider who your riding with whether it be a friend or group of friends or maybe family members you wouldn't want to risk their lives and yours only because you grabbed your phone to look at for a few seconds. You should think twice before reaching for that phone and think about what you do. If they say don't use your phone listen to them and don't think about it focus your eyes on the road. It is not worth all the trouble.

Finally, the third reason you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is it is probably illegal. Almost all the states including some without cellphone prohibit text messaging while driving. In most of these states, you can be pulled over and cited for texting as a primary offense. When on the road be careful what you do and don't think about grabbing your phone even if it's just for a few seconds.

Overall, you should never use your phone while operating a vehicle because it is very dangerous. Remember you could risk injuring yourself or someone else. Consider who your driving with and it is probably illegal depending on the situation.

When we think of cell phones we think of a device that we can't live without. A cell phone is something so essential to our lives that when we use them we tune everything else out. We constantly stay on our cellphones to distract us from the problems that are happening in the real world. We use our phones everywhere we go but we never watch our surroundings. When driving it is important to know your surrounding but when you're distracted by messages and phone calls and social media it puts the passengers and your life at risk

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at four times greater risk of a crash. Despite a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hands-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary for emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Yes, people should enjoy their rights to talk, text, snap, and all the uses of their phones just not while they're in their car. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and other people's lives. If people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase.

Imagine that you are driving and you get a text from someone and you feel that you just had to answer. Then you respond and when you look up your unable to stop in time and then everything goes black. This whole situation could have been avoided if being on your phone was not as important as your well being and others. Although it may be convenient to text while driving, it is increasingly becoming the reasons for car accidents today. Texting while driving in any situation while operating a vehicle should not be used.

Texting while driving is causing you to not have at least one of your hands off of the wheel. Looking down at your phone will make you react to anything that may occur slower. Someone who is attentive is able to react to a possible accident occurring whilst the person texting and driving would not. This is known as defensive driving when one is able to defend yourself against dangers on the road. One who is using their device while driving lacks defensive driving.

Using your mobile device while operating a vehicle is said to be ""approximately 18% of all fatal crashes are caused by texting and driving"", according to drive-safely. net. Within the year of 2012 itself, 3,328 people were killed because of texting and driving; while around 420,000 were injured. Also, a poll taken in the United States showed that 40% of teen drivers had admitted that they text and drive. These numbers have went up five times as much as they were.

Most people do not know this or choose to ignore it but texting while driving is illegal. Many states either have specific or various laws about texting while driving. If there was an accident to occur and and authorities find out it is due to texting and driving then you will end up facing a judge. For example, if you were texting and driving and you were to distracted on your phone to see a pedestrian then you could be charged murder.

People tend to text and drive without realizing that it may cost their life or someone else's. A text is never that important that could possibly change your life for the worse. It may be considered cool or easier to just be on your phone whenever you want, but it is the increasing reasoning for car accidents. Texting and driving is illegal for a reason and that should be a very serious law to abide by. Before you decide to pick up your phone while your driving just ask yourself: Is this really worth putting myself or others at risk?

Drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle for these reasons. The first reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is to inform loved ones if the situation their in changes, they can do so if they have handsfree because if they do not have handsfree it is illegal especially in Georgia. The second reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is that it is nighttime, and they have trouble staying awake, so they call loved ones and have a conversation to help them stay awake, doing so with a handsfree. The third reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because drivers pay a lot of money to get handsfree. Not be allowed to use cell phones at all is like the government robbing them twice. Twice because once for the handsfree, and another for a ticket for using it. The fourth reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because they might need to report a bad driver.

The fifth reason drivers should be able to use cell phones operating a vehicle is because they might listen to satellite radio on their phone instead of listening to FM radio. On their phone because it is better for their money to use it at home and outside of the car and when you are in the car instead of using the satellite radio source on the radio to connect their phone to Bluetooth and play satellite radio there. The sixth reason drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because someone at your job may not know your on the road and try and call you and you need to answer it.

In my opinion, drivers shouldn't have access to cell phones while driving on the road.

The reason is that we have too many accidents, Insurance Rates & it's illegal. If you are texting and driving you are 23 times more to have a car crash. According to the stats, 49 percent of American Adults drivers admitted while driving. Over drinking and driving texting and driving has passed to number 1 on distractions for people while driving.

According to The National Safety Council reported that in the past year people there were 1.6 million crashes due to texting and driving. Also as I stated in my intro paragraph ""if you are texting and driving you are 23 more times more likely to have a car crash. 1 out of 4 car crash deals with on the phone while driving. In 2013 3,154 people died in car accidents due to texting and driving. In 2016 263 Teens (ages 15 to 19) were killed as a result of texting and driving.

Also if you text and drive your Car Insurance Rate will go up. Because of people texting while driving Insurance rates have gone up 20 percent since 2014. More and More Insurance companies are starting to track cell phone use for drivers they insure. Car Insurance premiums are determined by many different factors including where you live, your age and your driving history. Why does texting and driving impacts everyone? Because so many people do it car insurance companies have been raising their rates.

According to the law there is 46 States in the U.S. plus Washington D.C. , Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands has banned/Pementid drivers from texting while driving.

Thirty-Seven states in all have a cell phone ban. That means that any cell phone use by the driver while on the road is Prohibited. There are three states that have secondary enforcement which is Florida, Nebraska, Ohio and South Dakota. Which means officers need another reason to pull you over before they can issue a ticket for texting and driving.

In Conclusion, I think drivers shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while driving on the road. It is too dangerous for drivers to be on their phones while driving. It causes accidents boosts up your Insurance Rates and plus it is illegal in most parts of the U.S. In my opinion it should be banned in all states that no driver should be able to do any cell phone use while driving.

Most of the time its because they are texting while driving. Technology has drastically increased. They seem to use their devices more than anything, which cause them to not want to put their phone down because they are afraid they might miss something. I feel like no matter what happens people might think they know how to pay attention. You still shouldn't do it because you never know what might happen one day.

People feel like they have to reply to a text message immediately , which leads to vehicular accidents that may result in death. The age group that are involved in these accidents is 16 year olds and up to 30. This should take a direct impact on life because it gives people a chance to see what can happen if a person if you text while drive, it can cause your life or someone else's.

However, in 2011, 3,331 people were killed in crashes due to distracted drivers. For this reason, it is very important that we find a way to break the habit of texting and driving. If we don't stop this now the rate of accidents and deaths will quickly increase. Law enforcement have came out with a law when you can not have the phone in your hand , do this work? No, people still text and drive and end up injured or killed. Because of this we should put our phones down or turn them off if you can't keep your hands off it. A text or post can wait if it means it will save your life and someone else's.

Some people might say ""i can multi-task"" or ""i know what im doing"". Those that's saying these things are the main ones that in involved in accidents.

I know someone who actually past away from a wreck and there eyes where on the road so its a greater chance of wrecking when your eyes aren't on the road.

A lot of people don't belive in having to not use something they paid for at anytime until they experience a wreck or hurt someone els. Like why even risk losing your life because you wanted to be on the phone while driving. There are even ways to prevent crashing while talking on the phone like putting it on the bluetooth it's even been proven to be the best way to talk while driving.

The reason me myself and other people say bluetooth would be the best solution is because you won't have to fumble with the phone while talking and driving you would have it right in your ear. Bluetooths are wireless earphones which you don't have to have your phone in your hand. It could easily be a situation were your talking on the phone while it's in between your cheek and shoulder and it slip and you try to catch your phone and lose control driving that's why i prefer bluetooth.

Driving while talking can be done in a way but texting while driving is another thing. Texting while driving is dangerous because your eyes won't be a hundred percent focused on the road. I do not agree with texting while driving it's totally different from talking while driving. You will have to be hands on and looking at the phone in order to text.

Texting while driving is so dangerous, that it replaced drinking and drinking to be more dangerous. Reasons why Texting while driving is dangerous can lead to death and permanent injuries to yourself and others, adults need to set an example and also its illegal . A big part of the problem is people are very confident that can safely text while driving, some even claim that it is easy to do the two at once. And here's why i believe these reasons are dangerous.

Texting and driving can lead to your death and loved ones. Distracted driving has become a dangerous practice on our streets and highways. In the United States, 3,328 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes that involved distracted driving in 2012 alone, while an estimated 421,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes involving a distracted driver according to distraction. gov. Aside from the statistics and number of deaths, think about if you want to be the one responsible for a close friend or family member death or injury because you didn't want to the phone down.

Another reason is adults need to set an example for the youth. Why wouldn't young drivers think it's okay to text and drive? They've seen other people do it, perhaps even their parents. Did you know forty-eight percent of young drivers have seen their parents drive while talking on the phone. This is where adults can help educate on the dangers of distracted driving

- by setting the example and taking the ""it can wait"" approach. There are also many different resources for parents to help educate their kids about distracted driving. From text-free-driving pledges to drive cams that monitor a driver's activity. A lot of people think it isn't that serious to enforce, but it is . Its very important to ensure the safety of our young.

Last but not least, texting while driving is illegal. Any form of text messaging while driving is illegal, and is considered a petty misdemeanor statewide. While the fine for texting while driving may only be $150.00, it also carries one point on your driving record, which may result in higher insurance premiums or possibly even cancellation of your policy. Fines up to

$500; or $1,000 if an accident results. Another question to ask yourself while reading this essay is, you would risk your privilege to drive to send a text when you can simply wait, or pull over, turn your vehicle off and then send your message. If one is not able to do this then being behind the wheel wouldn't be for them.

In conclusion is texting and driving can result to death, adults need to lead by example, and its against the law. texting and driving is a serious matter, and shouldn't be taken lightly. It's up to society to make the right decision and abide by the rules.

Cellphones are a big part of the modern world today. Everywhere you look there are people using their cellphone, but one place no one should never be using their phone in their vehicle. Driving while using a cellphone is very dangerous. If someone has received a text while driving they should ignore it until they get to their destination, or a accident could occur.

When someone is driving their phone should either be in their console or in the driver side door, and it should be on silent. There should only be one exception to use a phone while driving, and that is if someone needs to use their GPS. Then it should be in a secure place where they can hear the directions and know where to go.

These are the two questions you should ask yourself before picking up your phone while you are behind the wheel. The statistics are out of this world people are dying every day because of distracted drivers. Texting and driving is very dangerous because during the time you check your phone your brain cells reaction time slows down and it causes a potential accident.

In 2018 4,637 people died in car crashes due to cell phone use. In my opinion I say that people should not use their cell phone while driving. People lose their lives everyday just because of a single text or phone call. Researchers have come to a conclusion that using your phone while driving is 6x dangerous than driving drunk. If you answer or check a text that could take about 5 seconds but if you are traveling 65 mph while doing that who knows what can happen in those seconds. 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving .74 percent of drivers support a ban on hand-held cell phone use. The fact that those numbers do not equal out are problem and this is why I do not agree that people should be allowed to use their phone while driving.

Texting while driving is a problem now more than it has ever been, as 69 percent of U.S. drivers between the ages of 18 and 64 admitted to using their cell phone while driving during the previous month. Texting increases a crash by 23 times, it's a habit that must be stopped, across age groups and geographic locations alike. 40 percent of teens state that they've been in the car with a car with someone who was diving when using their cell phone in a way that put them in some kind of danger. While the maximum amount of time a driver can safely can change their attention from the road from is two seconds, it takes a driver five seconds on average to send a text message. Besides talking to your teen regularly about this issue and setting a good example by not using your cell phone while driving yourself, there are other simple ways to monitor your teen's phone use while they're behind the wheel. Start by activating smartphone features that help prohibit texting while driving. We need to take advantage of technology, utilizing apps that allow you as the parent more transparency into your child's whereabouts and driving habits.

In my opinion I think people should turn their phones off while driving. In this generations words don't mean anything. Signs don't mean anything. There are signs everywhere that say don't text and drive but due to the research nobody is listening. Companies are trying to go around this rule by making a profit. What I mean by that is we say don't text and drive but here's an example apple air pods you simply tap your ear and say text so and so and in an instant your message has been sent to whoever. I don't think that's safe either in no way is texting and driving safe. Even if you try to make it easier in my opinion there is no way that it can be safe. If you take your eyes off the road for even a second, the most dreadful things could happen. To many people die for that one text back that could have waited until you stopped or could have waited until you got to a red light. Many teenagers don't know that you could ruin your in literally 5 seconds.

There is one case in which your life can be saved when texting and driving. There is a law called the hands free law. Texting and driving could either be paid with your life or a ticket. In Georgia, the texting and driving ticket is the highest in the nation. If you get caught in Georgia that is a $150 ticket for violating the distracted driving law as well as one point on your driving record. The highest ticket you could be fined to is $1,000 in Iowa I think you're better off just following the hands free law. More money you get to keep in your pocket. Then to think about if you're texting and driving there's a possibility of you losing your life and a possibility of you killing someone else.

In conclusion, Texting and driving is very dangerous but tempting. Teenagers are the most tempted to text and drive. The technology today is controlling are minds. Why not use it to save our lives? There are way too many people making a simple mistake that will determine if they have another day to live. In the future we will find more ways to break this horrible habit that so many people are used to. Parents should teach their kids how to drive without distractions.

Reaction times decrease by 35% when texting and driving, compared to the 12% decrease when driving under the influence of alcohol.

36675E8BD1D8,"Distracted driving is becoming a huge problem in the world today. One of the main distractions is something that most people have with them everywhere they go, it is known as the cell phone. Cell phone use while driving causes many wrecks and injuries every single year. In fact, the majority of crashes every year are caused by distracted driving, due to cell phone usage. This being said, people should not be allowed to use their cell phones while driving unless they have a hands-free option.

Many people believe that they are capable of multi-tasking. The main thing people think they can multi-task at is texting and driving. When you are behind the wheel you are always automatically expected to keep your full attention on the road. Failing to do so could result in something as minor as a ticket, or something as major as a wreck that could seriously injure or kill someone. Let's say that you're driving down a not so busy street in a neighborhood. You think that because the street is empty that you should be able to text and drive without any issues, so you pull your phone out to text your mom. You don't even have time to glance down and back up before you run into a solid brick mail box, causing the inflation of your airbags. When that airbag deploys, it causes fractures to your face, and blunt trauma to your cervical spine. Was it worth it?

According to many websites, at least 1.6 million accidents per year are due to texting and driving. Out of these accidents, around 3,500 people are killed and at least 421,000 people are injured. Many states now have laws that require you to be parked in a safe place before using your phone and failing to do so will result in a ticket. In most states you are not allowed to even have your phone on your person while driving. It must be put in a seat or in the console of your car out of reach.

There are reasons upon reasons as to why you should not be allowed to use your phone and drive. Many people don't realize, especially young people, that phone usage while driving can cause your insurance to go up a lot. I'm sure you'd rather put your phone down, than to have to pay extra each month because you had to use your phone. Another thing people don't realize is that when you are on your phone and driving, your reaction time is worse than if you were to be driving under the influence of alcohol.

Texting and driving should never be an option for anyone these days. We have so much hands-free technology, that you shouldn't even have to look at your phone while you are behind the wheel. No matter the situation or who the text is from, if you ever feel the need to pick up your phone, pull into a parking lot and make sure you're safe. Remember next time you put your car in drive and go to reach for your cell phone, how many lives, including your own, that you would be putting in danger.

Technology and driving are a very dangerous pair they have taken so many innocent lives because people's faces are glued to their phone. In 2016 263 teen's age's (16 to 19) were killed by distracted driving. The NHTSA estimates that every day 660,000 drivers use electronic devices while behind the wheel. That's a lot of lives at stake because people are careless and can't just pull their eyes away from their phone's just to drive down the street.

In 2018 about 4,637 people died in car accidents related to distracted driving, by using cellphones. The technology of today has evolved or progressed to where there are so many new gadgets and apps that were constantly looking down at our screens. We also are always taking picture or videos while trying to drive and if you aren't recording yourself then you're probably trying to pose for the camera. Even when u don't like to drive and text or do whatever on your phone there are always going to be friends or family that encourage or want u to do something on your phone while driving. Out of all the crashes in the world 26% of those crashes are caused by texting and driving.

My reason for writing this essay is to agree that talking or being on a device while driving is dangerous. Here I will list my reasons for it being dangerous. First off it puts yourself and other drivers in harm's way and possibly hurt badly or even killed. That's you should put your phone away when driving or do whatever you have to do on it before you get on the road. Secondly you should think about the consequences before you do it such as, if I do this will it harm me and my drivers, or people in the vehicle with me. Even if you are a cellphone addict you should think about others before you drive and text.

So for the conclusion of my essay I will end it by saying this driving and text is a very bad way to hurt yourself and others on the road so if you care put down the phone, and put your eyes on the road. The world would be a safer place without people texting and driving and not paying attention to the road and their surroundings. We ask that the people that are texting and driving to please stop, because they are killing or are putting peoples children on the road in danger.

The number one cause of death among teenagers is car accidents. We can only assume that a number of these accidents were caused by distracted drivers. A distraction can come from anything, the radio, food, passengers in the car, and especially, the topic of this essay, cell phones.

The epidemic of drivers dying by the distraction of cell phones has become a major problem in the US because more and more technical advancements are happening as time goes on. When people are distracted while driving, even though it isn't intentional and they may not be thinking about it at the time, they are putting themselves and others' lives at risk. In the state of Georgia, it has become an official law that you can't even have your cell phone in your hand while driving. It is called the ""Hands-free"" law. You have to either have it completely put away, or up on a hands free cell phone stand in your car. If you get caught with your phone in your hand while driving in Georgia, you will get a ticket.

Currently there is no national law banning the use of cell phones while driving in the US; however, 39 out of 50 states now have laws banning the use of cell phones while driving, and almost every year a new one gets added. The rates of deaths by texting while driving have decreased since. In 2017, over 3,000 lives had been claimed by distracted driving, almost 300 of those lives being teens. That number has decreased since then.

In order to stop this epidemic from growing or even continuing, a national law banning cell phone use while driving should be put into place. Every year, the US is getting closer to that goal.        ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

In essay form, explain if drivers should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving. People are killed everyday by using their phones while driving. Sometimes people end up killing others while texting and driving. Laws have been passed to prevent texting and driving but many people still do it. These careless people make it difficult for other drivers to feel safe on the road.

You are more likely to crash if you're texting and driving. You are looking at your phone which causes your eyes to be taken away from the road. By the time you look back on to the road you could be seconds away from causing an accident. This gives you very little time to react and usually results in death or injury. You can just as easily pull over to the side of the road and text whoever you are texting. Or you could silence your phone and wait until you get to your destination to text back.

According to https://www. edgarsnyder. com 660,000 people text and drive everyday. 1.6 million people die from using their cell phones while operating a vehicle each year. Some people text and drive because they think they can multitask. Others do it because they like their phones or texting so much that they do it anywhere. Most people who use their phone while driving are teenagers or young adults. The average age range is from 18 to 34.

Compared to adults the percentage of those who use their phones and drive go down by at least 48 percent. Older people most likely don't use their phone while driving because they grew up in a time where they did not have advanced social media or technology and did not feel the need to be on their phones throughout the day.

Another reason you should not use your phone while driving is that you could get pulled over and ticketed. It is not hard for a police officer to catch you texting and driving. Most of them could tell by just looking at you since most people look down at their phones or hold it in front of them. A first offence ticket for texting and driving costs around 50 dollars and one point on your license. A second offense costs 100 dollars and a third offense costs 150 dollars. The points on your license go up until the number reaches 15 points in a two year period according to https://www. ajc. com/blog/commuting/georgia-distracted-driving-law-how-win-court/5vKbMEv47Mdrz2mRTBkkpK/. Once the points reach 15 your license will be taken.

Texting and driving can be avoided in many of the following ways. 1. By pulling over to the side of the road. 2. By keeping your phone out of sight and reach. 3. By turning off do not disturb. 4. By mounting your phone to something if you are using a navigation app. 5. By leaving your phone at home. The list could go on and on.

People like me want their family to come home in one-piece and for people to get hurt because someone was playing with their phone is not right at all. Therefore, I say there should be a law against people having their phone out while driving.

Teenagers are most likely to get in a car accident because of phones. I think teens get in more accidents than adults because they have their whole life on their phones and forget they are driving. Also, when they have drama in their life they have to check their phones every other second to see what this and that person said about them. Then they want to be all over social media to show people they are driving. The next thing you know they hit another car and someone is hurt. Lastly, they feel like they must text their boyfriend or girlfriend back as fast as they rather than wait until they are no longer driving.

Texting and driving are one of the most dangerous things in the whole world to me. I say that because people know that texting and driving is dangerous, and they still do it. Then when it happens they say it's not their fault and they know they were on their phone. When they see that they hurt somebody, they ack like they are scared and sorry but all they had to do is put down the phone and drive the right way. That is how most car accidents happen these days. It could all be prevented if the phones were put down.

It is clear to see why texting and driving is not smart. Just think, what if every time you put up your phone you save a family from getting hurt. What if it was your family getting hurt because somebody is on their phones. How would u feel? You wouldn't like it so why do it.

If you just put the phone down the world would be safer. This is something that can be prevented.

Smart phones have made it simple to stay connected at all times, but behind the wheel should not be one of those times. According to DMV.org texting and driving is the leading cause of death in teens. When you decide to do anything on your phone while driving you are putting more value on what you are doing instead of the lives around you. The act of being on a phone while driving is not only illegal, but also poses a distraction and puts you and others in danger.

At least 9 people are killed every day because of a distracted driver (DMV.org). When you are using you phone well driving it incorporates all 3 types of driving distractions. One being visual: takes your eyes off the road. Sometimes you can look at more than one thing at a time, but the road and phone are not included. Trying to send a text while driving is like trying to read a book and walk. The next type of distraction is manual: taking your hands off the wheel. Typing calls for two hands most of the time and driving calls for two hand, so unfortunately we only have two to give and I promise driving is the better option. The last type of distraction is cognitive: takes your focus away from driving. Most people have taken their eyes off the road to look at a cow or something of that nature and realized something bad almost happened and that is just a split second. Now imagine doing this at 55mph taking your eyes off to read a text, and reading takes a bit more concentration than just looking at a cow.

In addition to texting and driving being a distraction it is also illegal. A large number of U.S. states have passed law corresponding to this danger. Penalties for breaking these laws include: fines, license suspension, raise in auto insurance, and prison time. Do you really what to have on your chest the thought of you killing a father, mother, son, daughter just because you could wait to send a text? If you think about it the penalties are given to people who actually commit crimes. Do you want to do in the same category as a rapist? All of this because you couldn't put your phone up to get from point A to point B.

These penalties are the same as ones you get for a DUI. Thus meaning when you text and drive you are just as dangerous as an intoxicated driver. Driving with a BAC of just 0.01% increases your chances of causing a car crash by 46%, according to a 2014 study. If you'd never drive drunk why would you ever text and drive. Also According to the NHTSA texting and driving is six times more dangerous than drunk driving. Texting and driving is just as bad as drinking 2 beers. If you see how bad drunk driving accidents are why would you want to put yourself and others in the same situation just for a text?

In a word being distracted while driving is among the top most dangerous things you can do on the road. This is a bad habit to have but habits can be broken. Working on it now can save you and others from a world of pain and suffering later. There is no point in paying fines and jail time or even possibly killing somebody or yourself for a text.

Cell phones are used in our daily life in this day and age, but sometimes it could be dangerous for us to use them like while driving. Using a cellphone while driving is dangerous not only for the driver but everyone out there on the road as well. When driving with a cell phone it is sometimes hard to focus on the road which is putting your life and others life at risk. Everyday people die in car accidents because they made the choice to use a cellphone while driving.

According to research cell phones are the main cause of accidents, and studies show that using a cell phone while driving puts drivers at a four time greater risk of a car accident.

There are people that believe that having a cell phone while driving is ok, because they believe that sending a text message only takes your eyes off the road for a few seconds, but what they do not know is that in those few seconds something terrible could happen. When a cell phone is used you don't think about your surroundings and how it may affect others around you that's how it is when driving and using a cell phone. The number one cause of car accidents just so happen to be distracted driving. Also increases the number of deaths per year.

In conclusion cell phones should not be used while driving, sending a quick text message or checking your phone is not worth losing your life or someone else's. I believe that doing so would be inconsiderate of other drivers and also pedestrians as well. Also it is illegal in many states.

To start everything, I just would like to say that I do not agree with texting and driving. Teenagers driving and texting literally, leads to nothing good. With us being teenage drivers, we are automatically easily distracted. Now imagine how our bodies react when we hear that ""ding"" that we get a message from a boyfriend / girlfriend. Your body just reacts in a way I can't describe and it's like you HAVE to answer. Then with you answering you get distracted and that means you're not paying attention to the road and/or your surroundings. And the rest isn't anything pretty to talk about.

What happens next isn't anything pretty to talk about. Like I said in my first paragraph nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused from texting and driving. I've personally witness several accidents on my way to work. Some are worse than others but still, regardless of how ""big or small"" the accident is, ITS still an accident. Then in that spilt second you think to yourself and ask if that text was really truly worth it. There's a quote that I always remember when it comes to texting and driving, "" it can wait"" think about it , what would of happened if you did wait to text back? Maybe there would have been no accident, I guess no one will ever know because YOU chose to answer that text.

My final thought in this essay, is my personal experience. One day I was coming home from work and I was texting my girlfriend and I blinked and within that second I got into a car accident. I've never felt my heart beat that fast before, I was extremely scared in thinking if he was okay and if I was going to get my butt whooped. My other experience is my 3 friends who passed away last year. They were speeding along with some texting and sadly they all passed away. it was a very tragic year, leaning to live without them. And that's why I got all 3 of them tattooed on me. A reminder that im not suppose to text and drive.

That will conclude my essay but like I said , I DO NOT support texting and driving. Even blasting music and driving. Some people just don't understand that driving is not a game.

Texting and driving can kill in split second just the amount of time it takes to send a ""quick"" text message. Texting and driving is known to the world as one of the most dangerous things to do while on the road. Not only is it dangerous to the person driving, but also much more dangerous to the people and cars surrounding that particular individual.

According to many people texting and driving is similar if not identical to that of drunk driving. For example texting and driving physically and mentally impairs you to drive straight down a road, without causing a danger to people. As a whole population, we need to stop the use of texting and driving whether it's putting laws in place or designing a program that shuts off the use of texting the moment you step foot in the car.

The effects of texting while driving also can cause extremely hazardous driving conditions that compromise the safety of the driver and their passengers along with other drivers sharing the roads and highways. Because texting requires at least one hand on the device and the driver's eyes away from the road, the focus of the driver is not fully devoted to controlling the vehicle. This often leads to lane deviation that could possibly result in potentially dangerous situations.

Texting while driving puts many driver's lives in danger daily. Multiple people feel that staying connected to the outside world is more important than focusing on the road ahead, although it isn't. It can harm others on the road who are doing nothing other than trying to make it to their destination safely. If people would open their eyes to the dangers of texting while driving, less car accidents would take place every year and the roads would be much safer. Distracted drivers need to know the position they put others in as well as themselves. While behind the wheel, drivers should never direct their attention to their cell phone and should always keep their eyes on the road.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

She thinks that this could be important, so she checks the message. CRASH! Next thing she knows, she is waking up in a hospital,with her family and friends trying to tell her she was in a car accident. She tells her family and friends what happened for her to crash. She was texting and driving. ""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"" (Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving). Based on this information, a lot of people have crashed their cars and been hurt or lost their lives to cell phone use while driving. Using cell phones while driving puts the driver and others at risk, and there should be no cell phone use (texting or talking) while driving because it can cause wrecks and even death.

First, texting while driving is dangerous because it distracts the person driving which can cause an accident. When a person is using a cellphone while driving, the focus is on the text message and not on the road. Drivers need to be focused on just driving. Texting is very popular today, especially with people my age, and texting while driving has become really easy to do.

This affects my generation the most because, according to the article on ""Texting and Driving Accidents Statistics-Distracted Driving"", ""nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving""; teen brains, like mine, are trained to quickly pick up their phone when they hear a notification (Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving). When teens get text messages or calls from their partners or friends, they become more worried about that notification, and it seems that they sometimes forget they are driving. Cellphones can be like the devil.

The person is constantly tempted to use the cellphone at the wrong time and can become attached to it, which causes a lot of danger.

Talking on the cell phone while driving is also dangerous because it distracts the driver, too. Whether it is bluetooth or holding the phone in your hand, this distraction causes car accidents which can cause death of the driver and others. According to the TeenSafe article, ""it takes only 3 seconds after a driver's attention has been diverted from the road for a crash to occur"" (100 Distracted Driving Facts & Statistics for 2018). That being said, no matter how careful one thinks they are being, one moment of being distracted can change a person's life. When driving distracted by your cell phone, you can get into arguments with someone on the phone or can get horrible news that can cause you to lose focus on the road. This loss of focus can easily cause terrible injuries or even deaths. A lot of people have lost their lives because of their decision to talk or text on phones while driving.

To sum it all up, one should not drive and use their cell phone due to how dangerous it is. Driving distracted by a cell phone can cause car accidents with terrible injuries and even death.

Distracted driving is dangerous to everyone, especially teens. According to an article on distracted driving, ""driver distraction is reported to be responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes"" (100 Distracted Driving Facts & Statistics for 2018). Adults and teens put themselves and others at risk when they make the selfish decision to use their phones and drive. As studies continue to show, use of cellphones while driving isn't safe and causes harm and death to many people in our country. We can all do our part and put the cell phone away while driving. The life you save may be your own. Stay safe and make good choices. Do not lose your life over your cell phone.

In 2018 there were 1.6 million crashes annually from cellphones and driving. Cellphones are the lead factor that's caused accidents. Many accidents come from teens using their phones while driving. For an example they can create dangerous, and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident .For this reason cellphones should not be used while driving.

One reason why using phones and driving because when bad accidents takes instance people or teens lives.

they are also ruining people life like making people can't walk again, forget how to do things like walk, and, eat. Lots of people diening because of these cellphones calls or messages.

your cellphone can wait until you get to the place to see what the notification is. Caused too many car crashes to happen.

when teens phone are in the car and they get a notification. Teens are so anxious to see calls or sent a text.

Therefore, they should ban the cellphones completely while driving for the safety of everyone. When teens try to do two things at once. Multitask caused its them to have an accident quicker than a regular accident. Whatever the emergency, always wait until they stop or get to their destination.

My answer for teens is tempted to text and drive therefore they should not use cellphones while driving. Or have a phone in their surroundings. Banning cellphones while driving is for the safety of everyone. If so we wouldn't lose as many teenagers lives to tweets, texts and phone calls.

88B8F8666DA0,"SHOULD PEOPLE DRIVE WITH THEIR CELLPHONE OR NOT?

We all love our phones now a days and basically ever since they were invented. Everyone has one or wants one or the newest latest one .Ever since they were invented in 1700s people have taken the full advantage of the telephone presidents and war sargents used them to win battles and etc. Now the phone has evolved from tube looking phones to brick phones to flip phones to iphones and to smartphones. With all the new technology and apps like facetime snapchat3 games music social media there's almost no way anyone could ever put their phones down. But according to statistics in 2013 about 3,154 people died in accidents 424,000 were injured. In 2013, 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash.

So the question stands do we need to drive while on your cellphone? With all the crashes maybe we should drive without our phones but with the increments in technology we mind as well just use them cars are able to call people just like phones, so if you can call people in your car and be distracted anyways when your calling whom ever. There putting almost smartphones in the car so you can most defiantly be distracted with that. The fact that they are and already are making cars able to drive by themselves is anther reason that is very distracting just as in Tulsa the electrically powered car has pilot mode so it drives itself. So many people have been distracted from the road and driving because the car can drive itself even though the car can drive itself you still need to pay attention to the road.

I do understand that you don't need to be looking down when driving and I do understand that phones are distracting. So you picking up a cellphone and calling someone can be distracting. Also like I said in another essay I did there is a responsibility factor to firstly own a car and secondly to even own a phone. It might seem like it is not a responsibility owning a phone but it is when you own a phone you have personal information in it. If you were lose your phone and have never put a password or security code on it you can lose your information to whoever has your phone could be a hacker could be a random thieve.

So really my answer is that it really depends on your responsibility level if you can't stay off your phone and it's life then you need to let someone drive but if you can be responsible while driving then I'd say you should us your phone responsibly. Cause if you drive irresponsibly you should have your phone.        ",2,Phones and driving,Independent,0.2

Cellphone is the most used technology in everyone's everyday life wherever they go they have to bring their cellphones. Phones was a great invention that it helps people communicate anywhere and call anyone anywhere which is a good technology that can help people in everyday life. But Phones are the reason a lot of teens get into car accidents and can cause people's lives.

Texting and driving is one of the causes of car crashes this recent years, where the driver gets distracted and not paying attention to the road ahead of them. One of the articles I've looked up stated that ""Studies show that approximately 660,000 drivers attempt to use their cell phones while driving every day. While this number includes people who are texting, it also includes people who are checking their email, making, receiving or checking phone calls and using mobile apps"" (""Texting While Driving""). This shows that a lot of people who are driving text and can endanger their lives and other peoples. As most people think that a lot of car accidents are caused by drunk people or people speeding the article ""The Real Reason You Shouldn't Text While Driving"" stated that

""The most frequent driver mistake is ""recognition error,"" which encompasses ""driver's inattention, internal and external distractions, and inadequate surveillance."" In other words, most crashes are not caused by flagrantly intoxicated people, nor that aggressive driver who will do whatever it takes to get to their destination one minute earlier. Most crashes are caused by people like you and me who think they can pay attention to the road and do something else at the same time."" this shows that texting and driving is out of control and is dangerous for everyone who drive and text even though people know how dangerous it is, they still do it thats why states decided to ban texting and driving to stop people from texting while driving and stopping them from doing it.

In conclusion that people should take the law about texting while driving to stop the car accidents so they are less deaths and injuries due to texting while driving.

In a technologically advanced world like the one we currently live in it is easy for us to get caught up in our cell phones. Text, email, and social media link together all of your friends and family in one handheld device. With all these things we can do at the touch of a button it can be hard to put the phone down, especially while driving. What most drivers don't know is that cell phones contribute to a high percentage of deaths and car accidents in teen and adult drivers.

First, based on a survey conducted by the cdc ""Each day in the united states approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver."" This is an amazing statistic, out of the millions of people living in our country, thousands are getting killed and injured by simply looking at a text. Such a little task and it cost them their life.

Next, in a study conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the average driver is distracted by a text for 5 seconds, at 55 miles per hour you can travel the length of a football field. Imagine the amount of stuff that could happen in the length of a football field. Deer, pedestrians, sharp turns, you name it, and if you are distracted by a cell phone you could end up hurt, or worse dead.

So is that text message really that important? Can't it wait until the next stop? If you feel the need to check your phone i will tell you that waiting is the better option. If you check it right away you could end up as just another statistic and victim of distracted driving.

Due to many statistics and other research cellular devices are the main causes of car accidents. Many scientists have proven to us that cellphones put drivers at a very great risk of getting into a wreck. Even with this information drivers still choose to use there phone behind the wheel. Drivers have even resulted to using hand free devices, because they think that this is safer. Some people use the excuse that ""If there's an emergency they may need there cellular device"" to support the face of using their phone behind the wheel. There's a lot of evidence to support why drivers should not use their phone behind the wheel.

When driving it's very hard to focus on both the road and your phone. It's very easy to forget that your sharing the road with other people. Other people on take notice to drivers being on the cellular devices even if they don't want to or not because of the hazards they create. Texting while driving is the more dangerous than talking while driving. You take your eyes off the road for one minute and boom you've gotten into a wreck.

Most of the drivers that fall into this category are teens. These drivers have the highest fatalities behind the wheel due to using a phone. In the state of Utah using your phone behind the wheel , and you cause an accident it can land you in jail for up to 15 years. Most teens use airpods made by Apple inc, instead of holding the phone in there hand. This is even more dangerous because you can't hear your surroundings.

In conclusion: if people continue to use there cellular devices behind the wheel he number of casualties on the roads they will continue to increase.. It is the people's responsibility to not put their own and others people lives at risk due to there horrible actions.                          ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Let's say you were using your phone and you hit somebody and killed them what would you do. You would probably drive off and then call the police but if you did do that then they would check traffic cameras and the get your license plate and you would go to jail for a hit and run charge.

Research shows that cell phone use while driving significantly increases the chance of getting into an accident. Car accidents are the leading cause of death in teenagers because a majority of them are distracted drivers. The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction. For example, taking your eyes off the road to read a text or something of that sort it increases the risk of you crashing, driving of the road, etc...Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is setup. Drivers use of cell phones while vehicles are in motion should be prohibited because it is a vision distractor, it is law enforced, and it is a hazard to other drivers and passengers. This topic is very important in today's society because cell phones have become a significant issue on the roadway.

I think people should and shouldn't use their phones while driving. I think people who drive and pay more attention to their phones should be arrested and have their lisecen taken away because the could cause crashes , deaths and traffic . the most common death in America is car crashes because of stupid drivers and people looking at their phone while driving. Now the reason I say people should have their phones is in case of emergency like if they get in a car crash or if they have to call 911 to help someone. in the u. s. it is a law that you have to have your phone down from your hands while driving or at least have a Bluetooth device that can connect to your phone to your car so you don't have to look at your phone to call or answer a call while your driving a car . so I'm both with and against with this argument about if drivers should and shouldn't have their phones while driving    ",2,Phones and driving,Independent,0.2

Drivers should be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Drivers may need to use their phones in order to know how to get where they're going. There might also be an emergency in which the driver needs to use his/her phone to call for help. While drivers shouldn't be scrolling through social media while driving, they should be able to use their phones as needed.

Drivers use their phones as a gps device to figure out how to get to their desired location. Studies show that only seven percent of the 220 million cars in the United States have a built in gps navigation system. This means that drivers must find another way to get directions. The maps app on their phone not only gives directions, but it reads the directions out loud so that the driver is not staring at their screen while driving. Using a phone as navigation while driving is the safest alternative to having a built in car gps.

Furthermore, drivers need to use their phones to call for help in the case of an emergency. Emergencies are bound to happen, especially while you're operating a vehicle. Today's technology allows drivers to make calls using limited screen time and/or voice activation. This gives drivers access to using their phones while driving without causing them to take their eyes off the road. Having access to make emergency calls while operating a vehicle can help save the lives of many drivers and their passengers.

Some might argue that drivers should not be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. However, every driver at one point or another is going to use their phone while driving. Regardless of the reason, it is inevitible. While drivers should not be scrolling through social media and sending texts while behind the wheel, they should have the right to make emergency calls and use gps through their phones. Drivers should be given limited access to their phones while driving.

All in all, drivers should be given the right to use their phones while operating a vehicle. Phones can be used by drivers as a navigation system to help them get places safely. Phones can also be used to make calls in case of emergencies. All things considered, drivers should be allowed to use their phones to a certain extent while driving.

Using the phone while driving is one of the leading cause of death in America. Phones are supposed to help make communication easier, but instead using it causes a distraction. When the phone vibrates, the driver normally looks down at the phone to see what notification they just received. By checking the phone, everything can go wrong in the seconds it takes the driver to check.

It can cause an accident and it takes up to much time and money to fix the car. Not all accidents end lightly like some accidents can kill people.

The passengers also need to feel safe and conferrable in the car. If the driver is using their phone while driving with the passenger(s) and the driver gets into a wreck, not only does the driver get hurt but also dose the passenger(s). Sometimes the wrecks can get horrible and neither of them make it out alive. Other times the driver makes it and the passenger(s) do not. It is also possible that the passenger(s) could get nervous, reacted in a bad way, and make the situation a lot worse. Sometimes people do not realize how things can go from good, too bad, too worse in a couple of seconds.

There is a growing discussion debating whether people should be able to use their phone while driving or not be able to. Considering there's an average increase in car accidents since phones added all the features to text,games or watch movies but the phone is also a good access for people to navigate to their destination by wia gps. To continue with those topics people shouldnt be able to use their Device whether it's in hands free mode or not. It's too dangerous and a big risk.

Although, Having a phone can result in car accidents it most definitely helps when it comes to the navigation factor of trying to get to your destination. Whether it's the gps notify the driver there is another car accident ahead or heavy traffic. The end result which convinces most of the argument to side with the phone is that it helps the driver get to their destination faster.

Even Though, phones make it such a difficult topic to debate whether people should even be allowed to have phones on while driving but again not only do they help with getting to your destination quicker but it also can make people business better a lot of people answer the phone in the car and most of all those car have hand free mode which technically make the phone safer. ALthough phones get you yo your destination quicker it also has gotten so bad that the law made it illegal as stated "" Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdiction has made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal"".

Also , On the other hand it was found cars with the hands free mode are as dangerous if your device is on hand on mode which gets this argument rolling the article found states; "" the obvious implication is that hands-free phone calls may be almost as dangerous as a hand-held call. This danger is less obvious to the public, especially as a ban on hand-held calls can be seen to support the ""safer"" hands-free alternative"".(David Crundall)

To conclude, Driving with hand free mode can be equivalent to having hand held while driving but considering the quote/article from David crundall it proves people shouldn't be able to use their Device whether it's in hands free mode or not. It's too dangerous and a big risk.                  ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Cell phones were introduced in the United States in 1980 by engineer Martin Cooper. Since then cell phones have grown massively. More than 65% of Americans operate a cell phone. One main reason for the growth of popularity is that cell phones give us the ability to reach any person in a matter of seconds almost effortlessly. The technology of the cell phone has dramatically changed, for example Apple and their extraordinary enhancements to their devices over time. Cell phones are a necessity but not before your life or anyone else's. More than 1.5 million deaths occur a year due to cell phone use while driving. Cell phones should never in any case be more important than the road while you are driving. Drivers should definitely know to never use cell phones while driving, especially for a text.

Cell Phones provide communication with convenience, but they also have many other perks including cameras,games, etc. Cell phones can have many different uses, all of which can be very useful but at the right time. There are multiple ways in which a driver can be distracted while driving. They include talking to passengers, lighting up a cigarette and smoking,eating and drinking, etc. None of these have caused more deaths than distraction by cell phone in the USA. It is important to note that distracted driver attention by mobile phones means driving and talking at the same time, which raises safety threats. Drivers have to control both the vehicle and the mobile phone which makes focusing on the road a lot more difficult.

Drivers who use cell phones while driving not only endangers themselves but also other people on the road. As a result, most governments, including Austria, Australia, Switzerland and many more have created strict policies on phone use during driving. Due to lack of attention, drivers react slowly to traffic signals, sometimes missing. Decision making during driving is very important. Being distracted gives drivers a fraction of a second to make a quick decision in an intense scenario. Studies have highlighted that cell phone drivers react a lot slower and are more likely to make a mistake on the road.

Due to the statistics it can be concluded that, despite being a revolutionary way of communication, the use of cell phones during driving distracts the attention of the driver dramatically and puts lives at risk.                                                ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Waking up from a wonderful dream, you look around to what you can describe as your dull or gloomy-like room. Without even realizing, you've already picked up your phone and start to browse your social media. You check the time and go look outside your window and it looks like a wonderful day. You quickly decide to blast your music and dress up fashionably before you go out to your friend's place. Alast you finish by taking many, many selfies and videos and then share them all to your friends and a few social media platforms while getting in the car. Now you've started the car and are now on the way to your friend's house as planned before. On your drive, text messages start to ring your phone a lot and people try calling you. Meanwhile you are on the highway. Mind you, you just started driving two weeks before, so you're practically new to this.

At this point you only have two options, are you willing to get on this phone while driving? Or should you wait until your vehicle is at rest? You want to convince yourself that it may be an emergency but is it really a smart decision to fiddle with that device while driving? Let alone on a highway at about 75 mph? Which leads to the topic of this essay, whether or not a driver should use their cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

In general, cell phones are a huge distraction to society itself. Some in a good way, such as passing by time. But some in a dangerous way, such as operating a vehicle. Let's talk about how dangerous this is. According to research, reasons you shouldn't use your phone while operating a vehicle is pretty obvious. It's dangerous in numerous ways, as little as two second distraction is just enough to see who's calling and texting your cell phone but it's also just enough time to get you into a crash and cause chaos. Those few moments of looking at your phone rather than the road you're moving far and even enough to where you wouldn't see any pedestrians, motorcycles/bikes, or another person unexpectedly braking in front of you. Apparently stats show that cell phone use while operating a vehicle has increased with an added fact that 18 to 29 years olds are more than likely to be the people trying to access phones while driving. While that age group tends to have the high frequency of doing so, research supports that the age group over 65 have the lowest frequency. It wouldn't even be smart to use a phone at traffic lights. You may fail to go at the green light and that's when the illegal part comes in. There are tremendous amounts of consequences that can happen from driving all being, punishable or harmful.

In comparison, many other people may disagree and say that using a phone could be helpful. Based upon research, people claim there are great benefits to using your cell phone while driving. People feel they can use cell phones while driving safely with the help of hands-free technology. With laws banning hands-on behind the wheel impacting regions, drivers are saying that it's the typing of letters which takes too long that makes it dangerous. Even though people using hands-free devices and hands-on devices are equally bound to end up in a car accident, hands-free drivers tend to get fewer speeding tickets and general traffic citations than drivers using hands-on cell phones. More research states that pros of using a cellphone are for lifeline, navigation, cameras, traffic reports, and crime reporting. Drivers may need lifeline for road-side assistance for problems like car accidents where time is tight or paramedics and other emergency contacts that may be needed. Navigation assists drivers in locationing and maps providing real-time traffic reports, this supports the hands-free benefit of cell phones by a lot because it is very much needed. Cameras are important for quick situations such as car crashes. The person may need to hurry and catch a picture of the licence plate of whom might be performing a hit and run. Traffic reports provide drivers with up-to-date traffic updates on traffic jams, highway closings, and accidents. And lastly crime reporting for suspicious and illegal actions a driver may have spotted. With research it's clear many drivers can support that there are ways to operate vehicles while driving safely.

In my opinion, there shouldn't necessarily be any use of a cell phone while operating a vehicle. It's very dangerous and can cause people to be harmed badly and even bring death upon people. I feel that bluetooth music, texting, and calls, are not an excuse to grab the phone while driving. All texts and calls can wait because little do you know your life's on the line especially when your vehicle is moving at any type of speed. And music can be changed within good time management. I understand that people may have jobs that may require them to use their phones while driving and that's where advanced technology takes place. Advanced technology is allowing vehicles to assist drivers for safety or the vehicle may even drive itself. Hands-free cell phone usage has been promoted but now more safely than ever in this generation but I still feel that even all of the hands-free technology can even be quite an amount of distractions. Mind you one of the biggest and important rules of driving is to focus on the road. It may be hard sometimes considering that at young ages cell phones are practically habitual and it's almost like we need them for everything. Notice how in the introduction I brought how a cell phone is being used. That was to show how big of a role a cell phone plays in our lives, and me mentioning being a new driver was to have a bigger as to why the phone shouldn't be used. Using a cell phone while driving is very, very dangerous to you, and even others in some cases.

In conclusion, if causing harm and chaos is the last thing you want, the suggestion should be to not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. Hands-free may sound great and all but it can be just as risky as hands-on cell phones. Surely the messages and calls being received can wait until after your drive. There is no need to add on top of stats like accidents because of cell phones. As the saying goes ""safety first!"" And that safety plays a big role in everything, in this case driving.

Now back to the questions. Are you willing to get on this phone while driving? Or should you wait until your vehicle is at rest? What's your decision?

In this essay I will be talking about if people should be able to be on their cellular device while they drive or should they not be able to? In my opinion I don't think we should be able to because there are many dumb drivers without phones in their hands and the good drivers turn worse with one in their hands. More car crashes will happen and more deaths will come with it. I just don't think putting another distraction in drivers hands would be the best option for the road.

To start off this essay I believe having any type of electronic device while you are operating a vehicle is a distraction and can cause wrecks and deaths. No type of electronic device should be in the drivers hand only type that should be allowed is the phone holders that are legal that clip onto your A/C vents but shouldn't be texting on it only phone calls and the driver should always have both hands on the steering wheel as you drive.

To conclude my essay having a phone while driving is not necessary in any way. Just wait till you park somewhere or you get home to check it, because your life is more important than a text message.                                               ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc.

Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time.

Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving.

As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Scott Clark, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consultancy BuzzMaven Labs, says ""[He] came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph."" Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of ""[...] the rusty red Camaro [tailgating] the minivan full of kids."" Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. Any one of us could have been that poor individual on that fateful day. I used to ride my bike everywhere, mostly using the roads in the way that bikes are supposed to.

CBB6B78B7E7D,"Should drivers be allowed to use their cell phone while driving you may ask? I believe not. In this essay, I will be explaining why drivers should NOT use their devices while operating a vehicle.

Using a cellular device while driving is a dangerous hazard. An expanding number of studies demonstrate that driving while at the same time chatting on a cellphone can be very distracting. However, most states have not banished handheld telephones, and none have prohibited all drivers from utilizing without hand gadgets.

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research mobile phones are driving components that reason mishaps. Studies demonstrate that a mobile phone put drivers at a four-time more serious danger of an accident. Regardless of risk, individuals still use mobile phones since they need to be constantly accessible and stay in contact with other individuals.

People state that hands-free set is security since individuals can drive utilizing two hands. I any case, without hands gadgets don't wipe out the danger of causing an accident and even make it worse by recommending that the conduct is protected. Inquires about demonstrate that utilizing a headset can be as hazardous as holding a telephone while driving while driving that the discussions can take away attention from the drivers from concentration on the road and other drivers.

In conclusion, if individuals don't give up the cellular devices the number of innocent people dying on the streets will increase. It is the individual's duty to not bring about their own and other individuals lives. We need to stop these reckless accidents over something that is so simple to do. Put your phones away until you reach a certain location.     ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

We all know how it feels to be driving and receiving text from friends and or family. Its very hard to say no to yourself after you see the notification. A lot of people just tell themselves ""just real quick"" or ""just this one time"". Everyone knows that texting and driving is a bad idea but nobody knows exactly why. About 90 percent of car crashes are not due to drunk drivers or people who are speeding. But they are due to drivers like me and you who think they can do two things at once.

Answering these text messages takes a lot of attention off the road. As humans we can only multitask in a couple ways and they aren't that good. Texting and driving causes you lose awareness of what's around you. People crash most cause they don't see oncoming vehicles or they don't see certain things from a distance. Keeping your eyes off the road can be the difference between life or death in a car crash. It all comes down to how fast you were going and your reflexes.

driving doesn't feel dangerous. We may recognize on a cognitive level that distracted driving is stupid, but we have no accompanying visceral feeling of fear, no associated emotion to guide our decision-making in the moment of temptation. Our brains do such a good job making us feel like we're in charge that we don't realize it's all an illusion until it's too late. If our hearts started racing as soon as our attention started to drift, we might be more inclined to stay focused.

we feel immune to the risks that affect other people. Researchers who study texting while driving find that their participants ""have observed others driving erratically while using a cell phone, but these participants rarely, if ever, thought that their own driving was impaired when they used the cell phone."" And despite the fact that there is no benefit to practice (people who regularly use their cell phone while driving perform no better in studies than those with less real-life experience), the belief that we can manage persists. Consistent with this, three out of four people think they are above average drivers (a statistical impossibility). We are simply overconfident in our abilities.

Do you use your phone while you're driving? Or do you be in the car with people who use their phone while they're driving? I believe we should be able be to use phones while we are driving. For one people always have rode emergencies. Secondly, people be needing directions. Thirdly, to keep up with the weather while traveling.

Emergencies always happen on the road. It ranges from wrecks to flat tires. People always need road side assistance. Without a phone how would you call 911 if someone have a wreck and need assistance right away? Things always happen when you're on the road, you can only control the way you drive. Not the way others drive.

Most people don't know there way round the whole entire world. It's not fun to be lost. So directions is the key to stay on track. We don't want to stop people on the road to keep asking them questions. You may say ""Why not just use a map""? Maps are confusing for some people. Not everyone is like that though some people rather go old fashion. Also some people might not have extra money to buy a car GPS. If you have an app on your phone for free, why pay money out your pocket?

Weather is important while you're driving. Some weather be to savior to drive in. So checking it frequently is important. Weather can cause accidents and everything. How else you're going to check it while traveling? The radio may tell you but what if you miss, what you are going to do then?

Seeing all should of changed your mind. If not changed your mind it made you rethink things. Just remember using phones while driving is okay. We should be able be to use phones while we are driving. For one people always have rode emergencies. Secondly, people be needing directions. Thirdly, to keep up with the weather while traveling.

In today's day and age, we are privileged to have the ability to drive vehicles anywhere that we please. The use of technology gave us the responsibility of driving. With that being said the responsibility of driving is very important because you're not only putting your life at risk, but also other drivers on the road. There can be many distractions while you are driving which can cause you to wreck and be seriously injured from it. One of the biggest distractions in today's age is the use of cellphones. With the improvements made to technology, you can use cellphones anywhere on the road, which causes it to be the number one distraction. I personally feel that the use of technology should not be allowed while driving unless it is under an extreme circumstance.

To begin, one of the main reasons that causes cellphones to be one of the most distracting items is due to the texting and driving. According to the National Safety Council they reported that ""cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". They also reported that ""nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. With those outrageously high statistics, I strongly agree with the idea of doing away with cellphones while driving. Also, 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving and 74 percent support a ban on hand held cell phone use. Having that high of a support percentage shows that are many other people who feel the same as I do. It is a very dangerous problem that is going on in todays day. With myself being a high school student and driver, I can first hand tell you this is a major proem with teens. I see many of my friends and also other students of my school using their cellphones while there driving and putting themselves in dangerous situations. There are many reoccurring issues with cellphones and driving that I'll be sharing more of in this essay.

After writing my first paragraph I ended off talking about the teens and cell phone use while driving situation. As the majority of people know the using your phone is very dangerous and also distracting. However, with the teen's situations there are 16-year old's and older who are not that experienced with driving but are also more easily distracted then adults. There was a poll made by AAA saying that ""94 percent of teen drivers know the dangers of using their phone while driving and up to 34 percent admitted to doing it anyway"". With this kind of statistic just proves the point of not allowing any use of a phone in a motor vehicle. I would also like to talk about the other drivers on the road. There are many other safe and focused drivers on the road, who are following all the rules of the road. Those careful drivers have also been the victims and ended up being seriously injured from the distracted driving with phones and also many other reasons. I personally have an example to give with this problem. My Cousin was killed by a driver who was going down a road, speeding in the rain, and also texting while driving on top of all that. Phones being used in motorized vehicles is a serious issue and luckily a law has passed in the state of Georgia, stopping the use of them in cars, but hopefully people will start to follow that law.

There are plenty of other distractions that go on when driving a motorized vehicle, but the use of phones is most caused. These deaths and accidents from distracted driving with your phones can be very managed. If people were to follow the law of not using them in the car and to be more careful then these outrages percentages will become more and more less. Also, I would like to express the fact that there are many options in vehicles that allow you to use your devices via Bluetooth and voice control. So, if there was an emergency you can answer and talk on the phone without even having to pick up your phone and looking away. This concludes my essay I strongly believe in not using your devices while driving and I hope to have expressed the effect is has.

B36AC1539899,"I believe that drivers should not use their phones while driving. The reason behind this is that Mobile phone use while driving is common, but it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes. Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Many jurisdictions have enacted laws to ban handheld mobile phone use. In some cases restrictions are directed at minors, those who are newly qualified license holders (of any age), or to drivers in school zones.

In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash. In the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones. In 2017, 3,166 people were killed by distracted driving. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash.

Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone. Drivers who text while behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting while driving. Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done.

In conclusion, I believe that driving while using your mobile device should not be allowed. It is a distraction that can cause the driver and innocent bystanders to lose their lives over something that can easily be prevented.

This essay is about if drivers should or not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I strongly feel like drivers shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can be dangerous for them and everyone else on the road.

Using your cellphone can actually be deadly. because cell phones can cause inattention blindness while driving, you are putting yourself and others around you in danger, and placing a ban on cell phone use while driving is proven to be effective.

Using your cell phone while driving is very common nowadays. When people use their cell phones while driving it sometimes has a negative effect. Cell phone usage while driving is a common occurrence in today's society. Unfortunately, it often has a negative impact on drivers using phones and those surrounding them. Because of the growing popularity of cellular devices in modern society, the urge for the public to use their phones frequently is severe.

When you are using your cell phone while driving, you're doing all three types which are manual, visual, and cognitive. Manual distraction is when you are taking your hands off the wheel for even just a split second. Many deadly accidents are caused by someone bending down to simply pick up their phone that fell on the floor of the car. Many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens. That's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours.

Should you text and drive, no you shouldn't. Texting and driving is a bad thing it can cause accidents and people might die including yourself. Over 2.5 million people in the U.S. are involved in road accidents each year. Of these, 1.6 million have a cell phone involved in them. That's the majority of all road accidents in the United States. Over half the road accidents in the States have cell phones involved, and if this doesn't make you realize just how potent it is, what will. Texting and driving should not be allowed because a lot of innocent people each year die because someone wants to be on there phone.

In most states, texting while driving is considered a primary-enforcement violation, which means officers can issue citations any time they observe drivers texting and driving. Others have secondary enforcement, meaning officers can issue citations only if they've stopped drivers for some other offense. People can be charged for texting and driving such as Monetary fines these can range from as low as $20 up to $500 depending on the state. You also have Criminal charges, in some states texting while driving can result in criminal misdemeanor charges Class B or C. Class B misdemeanors are punished between 90-180 days in county jail. Class C misdemeanors receive the least amount of time, usually 30 days or less.

Cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. Over 2.5 million people in the U.S. are involved in road accidents each year. There are more accidents in texting and driving than all the road accidents in the U.S. each year, that's a major problem.

I believe the penalty should stay the same time in jail and the fines that you'll receive. Monetary fines these can range from as low as $20 up to $500 depending on the state. Time in jail, between 90-180 days in county jail. But the major part of it is if you kill another individual person in the process, which I think you should be given major charges. Fines should be over $500 up to the $10,000 range. And time in jail should be 20 years maybe more depending on how many people you killed.

The conclusion to this is that Texting and driving is a major problem and we need to find ways to stop it. It's only going to get worse, because of the new technology that will be coming in the future. Even though people have habits for checking their phone they should just turn it off and focus on the road. That in all should stop the accidents in a hole, but sometimes people have import things they need to do I understand, but try to find ways to stop. You might be even saving your own life.

Have you been in a car and the driver decides to take a call while driving. You may not have gotten into an accident but for a limited time your life is completely in danger. Situations like this is why i think drivers should not use technology while operating a vehicle. Using technology while operating a vehicle because it can result in a distraction, causes of accidents, and putting others at risk.

There are a few people that would say they have to turn their music down to figure out exactly where their going. This is a type of distraction which is not good for the road. Distractions makes you lose focus of your surroundings while your driving. Resources shows that you are 25% more likely to look at your phone on the road if it rings. In 2015 391,00 injuries were caused by distracted driver. Distracted drivers are considered a new epidemic in america. With different technology being developed there are easier ways of people to get distracted while driving.

Using technology does a lot to a person while driving. Someone can gets into a really bad car accident because they are trying to answer a phone call or send a text. There are 1.6 million crashes on an annual bases. 19 people are killed daily by drivers who are texting.6-16% of all deaths in the us are caused by drivers sending or reading text messages. These deaths could easily be avoided if people don't look at or answer their phones while driving. Using technology doesn't just put yourself in danger but it puts others in danger as well. It endangers everyone around you. When you drive your life and people your in the car with live are in your hands and you shouldn't take that for granted. You have to be mindful on what you do to make sure everyone is ok.

In conclusion drivers should not use technology while driving because it puts everyone around them at risk. When drivers are on the road their focus should be on the road. They should not have distractions because those distractions can end someone's life in a blink of an eye. The text or call is not more important than you and the people around you lives.

In the state of Georgia, it is illegal to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle. I believe that drivers should not be able to use cellular devices in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Over the past two decades phones and technology have expanded and so have the dangers of getting behind the wheel with a cellular device. I believe that no one has a reason to be doing anything other than driving when in a vehicle. Cellular devices have become a major issue whether you're a senior citizen or a beginner at driving.

Over the past few years that technology has expanded into many forms more and more casualties have occurred on the roads. The United States Department of Transportation reported that cell phones are involved in about 1.6 million auto crashes each year meaning that these 1.6 million car crashes involved cellular devices being a distraction to drivers. Some of the cell phone related car crashes lead to deaths of the distracted drivers and even the people who weren't even behind the wheel. There are many different ways to be distracted by a cellular device. This includes texting, maps, email, and social media.

Emotions over text messages could also effect a driver's state of mind while driving. If a driver were to get mad or upset over something they saw or read they could get distracted and lose control of the vehicle. Also could affect others that are driving. Other drivers could be in danger if someone can't see because they are distracted texting someone back. Overall this means that emotions could overcome someone if they used a cellular device while driving.

The law in Georgia is called the hands free law in my own words I think of this as both hands on the wheel. This is the way that drivers should drive all the time with both hands on the wheel. Using one hand to call someone could cause you to not be able to react in an emergency. If an animal jumped in front of a car of someone using a hand to see the map on their phone for directions it could lead them to crashing and harming the animal because of the panic and only one hand to steer. I think that both hands is an important safety when it comes to driving.

These three major points support my reason as to why I believe that drivers should not be able to use cellular devices behind the wheel. Emotion effecting the capability of someone driving, casualties because of distractions caused by cellular devices and, two free hands that will make the possibilities of crashing slim to none.

In today's day and age, cellphones are extremely portable and accessible. Cellphones now seem to alway be in our hands and there've been debates on when we can and can't use them. Cellphones are always there even during crucial times and the wrong times. Texting and driving is an extremely dangerous act that causes major distractions, puts your life as well as others in danger.

Since the creation of the cellphone in 1973, phones have caused distractions. The creation of text in 1992 enhanced the distractions the cellphones caused and ever since then the distractions have gotten bigger. Those distractions while doing an activity that demands so much attention such as driving can be extremely dangerous, especially texting while driving. Texting while driving makes up 1 out of 4 car accidents, leads to 1.6 million crashes a year, and causes about 400,000 injuries each year.

Car accidents not only injure those who text and drive but it also leads to second hand effects of it. Thousands of injuries and deaths happen yearly due to distracted drivers harming others and those people could be passengers or just pedestrians. The danger for those who aren't the distracted driver are usually higher, since the passengers in the back don't have airbags and random pedestrians have no protection against the driver. Drivers shouldn't just take themselves into consideration, but also the safety of others around them.

The characteristics of distracted driving have been compared to their types of impairment driving. Driving such as drunk driving have been compared to distracted driving and drunk driving has even been proven to be less dangerous in some ways than distracted driving. Distracted driving had well over 100,000 more injuries than drunk driving, but drunk driving has well over 6,000 more deaths attributed towards it. The age group for distracted driving is mainly shifted towards teenagers and young adults between 18-24, rather that of the 26-29 range of drunk driving. It's been suggested that at any given point there'll be over 660,000 drivers using their phones while behind the wheel of a vehicle. States that ban cellphones at the wheel have resulted in the increase of hands free use as impaired to the states who haven't.

These numbers in accidents and deaths tend to go up or stagger any given year, the numbers won't go down if no ban on cellphones at wheel is placed. Teenagers are the most affected by any distractions caused by a cellphone, making them most likely to get in an accident. Distracted driving has resulted in more accidents than drunk driving and a plentiful number of unfortunate deaths. No driver, in any capacity should be allowed to drive while texting or distracted in any matter by a cellphone. It should be illegal and carrying the same punishments as a DUI would considering the number of accidents caused by such driving.

Nowadays in modern society there are many ways to interfere with safe driving conditions. More specifically something that a numerous amount of people us in their daily lives. This object is a cell/smart phone and it can determine life or death. There is a time and place for these devices but the road is not one of them. Yet, like every problem there is a solution and the solution to this problem can be fixed by heavy law enforcement.

The majority of people own or at least have seen a phone. Those devices have become more common over the years. These devices can become addictive and can lead to bad choices. For example, if you are driving and you get a text most people's reaction is to pick up the phone and look at the message. Even if you think it is harmless you could be in potential danger.

There are many dangers on the road already. Cell phones usage only makes worsens the fact that there are risks on the road. For safe driving conditions you have to keep in mind that if you use your phone while driving that text could be your last. Help out your community and become a safer driver.

When people ignore the fact that they are not just endangering themselves but also drivers. That means the law enforcement needs to step in and take action to correct it. That would be the most effective way to simmer down this issue of cell phone usage during a vehicle operation. No texting and driving laws will definitely get into people's head.

In the end you can make a difference. You can help by not answering that text or call while driving. There are many dangers on the road like new drivers and weather conditions so take that into consideration. You don't want to be the individual to cause a fatal accident and end your life or somebody else's. All in all don't de selfish and consider others and put an end to it.

There are even times drivers let their minds wander from driving. However, texting leave a driver especially teenagers to be effected by all these types of distractions.

Teen drivers are inexperienced and ill-mannered which makes them more likely to be involved in an accident. Out of most activities related to cellphones texting is the largest cause of distracted driving. Each year almost 390,000 car related injuries are caused by a teen that was texting and driving.

These are a few reasons texting and driving will ruin your life, drivers lose all awareness on the road and not paying attention, they lead to more crashes, and you're most likely to be at fault during an accident.

Texting is all throughout today's society like being at fault during accidents. When you're at fault for an accident it makes your insurance premium go up and nobody wants to pay extra just over a ticket. You will be the liable victim and you will need an accident lawyer and just to pursue a lawsuit. However it may be legal in some states it's really not the best option.

Suddenly you're driving down the street your girlfriend texts you and it's a serious emergency but youre on the highway going at a speed of 80 youre ruined. You just made your death wish there is no saving you just call it quits. Then did you know driving at speeds at 55 mph or above you can cover the length of a football field. Just keep the text message unread people can wait.

Nobody wants their life ruined over something so little and it's just not worth it not at this age, just live your life its better to be on unread than dead. Seriously!            ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Today, a lot of car accidents are caused by distracted driving. Texting while driving caused a lot of deaths and injuries Over the last few years. People confused themselves when it comes to texting and driving and they don't realize it's a mistake until it's too late. In my opinion I think its best if people turn their phones of completely before they leave their location. Texting and driving is against the law so young drivers and older adults should take it serious.

It doesn't matter who's texting you that notification can wait. Taking your eyes off the road while driving should never be acceptable. Me personally, I don't think it's the smartest decision to pick up my phone while driving for any reason. Another reason why it's not safe to text and drive is because it's against the law. Breaking the law against texting and driving results in you having to pay money out your pockets. So just try your best to avoid the situation.

Statistics are rising fast for car accidents caused by texting and driving. We all know the love ones at home wouldn't want us to be a part of that statistic. We can change our ways and lower the statistic by simply obeying the law and being patient enough to wait to check our phones. If you don't care enough to avoid a simple mistake, then so be it. My purpose for writing this essay is so people understand how risky texting and driving is so let's make it easy for one another and not be a part of that group of people who partake in texting and driving.

Cell Phones have become a prominent part of most peoples lives in this contemporary era. Smartphone ownership is growing rapidly around the world. In addition, the worlds population is 7.6 billion with an estimated 1.4 billion cars on the road. That is a vast eighteen percent of the population. This leads to the question, should drivers be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? I feel as though you should not touch your phone while operating a vehicle. A person is twenty-three times more likely to have a motor vehicle crash while texting and driving.

It maybe argued that people need their phones in dire emergencies. This is where the campaign ""It can wait"" comes in and other programs to promote wireless usage (ex. Bluetooth). Thus, ceasing any hands-on phone activity while operating the vehicle. Bluetooth wireless makes things more convenient for vehicle users. Calls, music listening, and more can be accessed using Bluetooth.

When texting and driving, your focus is mostly on your phone. Your focus is supposed to be fully on the road. Not only is there traffic, but you also must look out for pedestrians. You must be aware so that you can be able to react quickly to pedestrians that aren't aware and potential accidents (due to poor judgement of other drivers). Knowing and keeping track of your speed and the speed limit is also crucial. You cannot do as listed above when fully submerged in your phone.

Additionally, laws are being passed to stop driving and using a cellphone in any capacity of a vehicle. If seen doing so, you will get a ticket. As of July 1st, 2019, this law was put in place in Georgia. You would also receive a moving violation. Moving violations affect auto insurance. While cellphones are very convenient, we must be able to articulate when and where to use them.

We are aware of places where they are prohibited (e. g.: court rooms, airplanes, movies) therefore it will take some getting used to not being on your phone at all while driving. It is not impossible, though. We can still receive phone calls, especially those very important ones, of course. As mentioned before, the Bluetooth may be hooked up to your car, therefore one may talk wirelessly whilst driving. The conversation may be heard via speakers in the car. In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. It can always wait.

Today many people have cellular devices and they can be a constant problem. Some people have a habit where they look at there phone way to often, this is a problem. If someone is to be driving and they constantly look at their phones their risking their lives or maybe the lives riding in the vehicle. It is very dangerous and raises the risk of car accidents you could have. It is also illegal to text in drive because it's a safety hazard for drivers.

Phones affect society the more they develop and we will continue to buy cellular products. We buy these to stay in touch with friends, family, and the work place or maybe you might have one for research or games. The problem with these devices are that people tend to text and drive. Texting while driving is a risky action to take while operating a vehicle. Phones are a distraction to people who drive and can't leave the phone alone. This distraction is serious it can get someone severely injured, killed or even a ticket.

There is a law for texting and driving that's good because it can prevent more people to stop texting and driving. The law bans cellular use while operating a vehicle so that we can prevent car crashes. This law is important without this law there wouldn't be no control on texting and driving. Most people follow the law but many more people don't. There are also certain age groups who text and drive and there are affects from the age groups.

Different age groups tend to text and drive. Teens are more distracted by the devices because teens usually text friends a lot and it becomes a habit. Teens who drive are still learning to drive better and when phones distract them it raises their chance higher than other age groups because their reaction time may not be high as developed drivers. Adults with higher driving skills who text and drive still have a high risk of a car crash. They have better driving experience but it's still possible that they could crash. Crashing is a cause by not paying attention or the other person could be the one that was distracted.

Texting and driving is as dangerous as drinking and driving. Texting and driving raises the chance of crashing six times higher than drinking and driving. Each year at least 1.6 million drivers have crashed because of being distracted at least six thousand drivers have been killed by being distracted. Drunk driving causes more than ten thousand lives per year. It doesn't matter which one is more dangerous it's still a high risk for a car accident.

Texting and driving should not be allowed because this can get people injured or killed. To prevent texting and driving there should be more officers on the road stopping people from texting and driving this should be affective in areas where texting and driving is high. The reason I said areas where texting and driving is high is because if a lot of people text and drive in the same area not everyone is paying attention and this could cause more crashes. This will also make people know they shouldn't text and drive because the police are out to give tickets. Hopefully this idea will work permanently without having police around trying to give out tickets.

It's good that police give tickets to those who do text and drive, they don't do it because their picking on you they do it to help prevent you from risking your life. When a officer gives you a ticket this ticket usually comes with a fine. You have to pay this fine or there will be serious consequences. You driver license may be suspended and you won't be able to drive any where. This is bad for people who work, go to school or go places they need to be. Hopefully people will learn it's not right because it's not worth risking your life over a text you could have waited to send.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Typically, whenever and wherever, everyone is engaged in some form of technology, cell phones in particular. From pagers, to car phones, to initial ""flip-phones"", and now to smart-phones, people practically use up most of their daily time with these devices. Nowadays, a lot of people doesn't even like to have phone conversations...they can deliver their entire thought through a simple text message. In some retrospect, that's a very good thing; in others, it can be extremely crucial, especially when it comes to texting and driving.

Texting while driving has become the number one driving distraction for many people. Drivers need to be aware of the dangers and keep their attention on the road, not on their cell phones or other mobile devices

These advertisements are hard to watch. No driver wants to think about being responsible for a traffic accident that takes his or her own life or the lives of other motorists or pedestrians. Nevertheless, most drivers still use their cell phones while operating their vehicle. While taking a phone call is dangerous enough, the advent of text messaging made cell phones even more incompatible with driving a car. Reading or sending a text or email takes both eyes off of the road, your mind off the task of driving, and sometimes both hands off the wheel

It can be dangerous to text and drive and in the united stated have around one out ten people are killed other people off the earth from text and driving Because it's an issue of attention-and there is only minimal extra distraction when picking up or holding a phone-it doesn't really help to use a hands-free device. Merely thinking about something other than the road is enough to strain attention and increase your risk of a crash.

You should not text on your cell phone while driving because being distracted by texting is similar to driving while intoxicated. Texting on the phone while driving can cause you to react more slowly when an unexpected driving hazard emerges or perhaps to never see the hazard until it's too late for the other people in the car to not to get hunt other on the road the haved a red light to having crash car and to texting and drive.

Communication is something that has been given to the human race ever since the first man was coined and has been ever so crucial for our development to how we are today. We come so far as to create a device to communicate at great distances with a single tap, this device is known as a cell phone. The device has gone through many alterations time after time to satisfy the needs of the average user. Cell phones are used on a daily basis and most spend up to nine hours a day, this behavior can be described as addicting. This addiction causes many people to not be aware of their surroundings which leads to many accidents; most of accidents occur on the road. Drivers should not be allowed to use their cell phones when in use of a motorized vehicle because it increases the chance for an accident and decreases focus during the ride.

Cell phones require much focus in order for one to operate it correctly, the same goes for using a vehicle so when you come across someone that is using a cellphone and a car at the same time, the chances of hitting something massively increases by almost 900 percent. The obvious reason why so many end up in an accident is because if you're in a car traveling at 60 mph then that would suggest that for every second you don't see the road you miss about sixteen meters of distance, sixteen meters is enough distance for anyone to be involved in an accident. Safety councils report that anyone operating a cellular device while driving leads to approximate 1.6 million crashes per year. Most of the crashes are generated by younger adults who are just beginning to explore the world but end abruptly caused by the foolish act of using a cell phone while driving. Some states are now combating this problem by being stricter on what is allowed in during the ride and may lead to a chain reaction for all state's decisions.

Government has had enough of all vehicle users to put innocent live at risk so they have passed bans for drivers so they would be punished if they are caught using a cell phone. About sixteen states have banned all drivers to have a cell phone in hand while in use of a vehicle including the District of Columbia, Guam, Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. In Georgia, the law has been effective since the first of July last year (2018) and with the ban in place, less drivers are causing accidents because of the incentive to pay 50 dollars on their first conviction. This is a very good method for reducing the amount of people getting into crashes, it gives the tempting drivers to stop using their cell phone while driving. There are many more reasons why you should not use a cell phone during a use of a vehicle but these are two that could be major in rank.

Many people use the skill that was given to us since birth and communicate with others around the world, it is very useful and can grow your social life as well as your culture. Many take advantage of this and use their cell phones while driving and putting many lives at risk including theirs, hopefully this helps other in grasping the seriousness of doing such action and will rethink how they drive. When someone calls you while you're driving please be smart and don't use your cell phone, this is why you shouldn't use your cellphone during the use of a vehicle.

Should people be able to use their phones in any capacity while driving? They should. Should people have complete access to their phones while driving? No, some of the features on phones should not be accessible while driving. Is there danger with using a phone while driving? Yes, there is, but the danger is in most of what is done on a regular day basis.

Why should people have accessibility to phones while driving? People should be able to because it is their property. Someone can not deny someone the usage of something they bought with their own money. A salesman can't sell someone a fork and plate and tell them not to eat. The salesmen can tell the consumer the ups and downs of their product. Then it becomes that person´s choice or whether or not they want to take that risk. It is all about personal limits.

Stating that danger shouldn't be prevented is idiotic. But someone's argument against something should not be the dangers of it. Everything, including phones and driving, are dangerous in themselves, but the more they are done, the worst they get. With this being known, would someone try to prevent people from drinking water because some people have died from doing so. No, they would allow them the knowledge of the dangers and allow them to set their limits. The exact same thing should be done for phones while driving.

This essay keeps stating that to limit the person's usage. Nothing can be entirely prevented because people will do as they please. But if you set limits, more people are subjectable to follow such limits. They are even more willing to do so knowing the dangers or consequences of their actions. Finally, let people govern themselves. It is not one person´s nor is it a group of people´s choice on whether someone can or cannot do something.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time.

So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.

Using a cell phone while driving can be harmful because you are not looking on the road and you are looking at your phone so you do not know what is going on around you. Also you can cause somebody else life that is doing the right thing while you are doing the wrong thing on the road. For an example you can be behind somebody and what if they press the breaks hard or stop and you do not know you just think they kept going ad you are on your phone and then boom car accident and it's going to be your fault because you were on your phone not paying attention to the road and then you have to pay for somebody else car damage and yours so the outcome would not look good for you either way. Another thing is you can get pulled over by a police and lose your license.

Another reason you should not text and drive is because you can end up seriously injured or probably killed. For an example in 2010 30,296 are deadly killed and 2,239,000 injured people that has been in a crash because of using their cell phones. People do not realize it can happen to them until they do it because people think it's not but when it does they can say nothing or if they are injured they are going to tell their friends and family do not do it and stuff like that and how it's not safe because they realize it's not nothing to be joking around with. Another reason driving and texting is not safe is you can get a ticket by the police officer. Also your car insurance will be more than what you are probably paying now and it might be hard for you to obtain it and stuff like that if you got other stuff you have to pay for.

Unless you want to end up in a wheelchair or in the hospital do not text and drive wait until you get in a rest area or pull over to the side if it is that important. Therefore, do not text and drive or there will be consequences.                   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Technology has made a big impact on the world today. The number problem with technology is CELL PHONES! We use cell phones all day and night. There have been so many accidents and mostly the cost of texting and driving. I think that drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving but only if emergency & navigation. This will lead to lower accidents in the u. s.

We all want to be on are phones every minute and every second but here are some facts that will make you think twice before picking up the phone. Approximately 600,000 drivers are attempting to use their phones while behind the wheel of an automobile. There are nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents while texting and driving. The reason its it so high because people are convinced that texting and driving isn't dangerous, we need us humans to realize that lives matter so we need to reflect on risks.

On the day of July 1, 2018 a new law saying that "" Drivers cannot have a phone in their HAND or touching any part of their body while talking on their phone while driving"". Meaning you will get a ticket and i'm pretty sure that nobody wants to get a 150-250 dollar ticket for doing something stupid. It's really sad when you think about it, people have developed skills and strategies to make it look like they're not on the phone.

People often feel like they will miss something and separated from the world when they aren't on their phone. So many many lives have been taken just because a single text or a single call.

During the past few years, phones become very popular in the world. Every generation has a telephone. A phone is just now a big part of the society today. Most people would rather text than to have an actually a physical conversation with someone. Phones become very distracted. Many accidents happened because of phones. Phones are taking over the world, and a lot of people are getting addicted to their phones. Knowing that it is dangerous to text and drive, we still do it; 90 % of you agreed to have texted while driving. I'd be lying if I said I had never texted while driving. But I recognize the dangers, and use the alternatives to prevent a car accident. It doesn't matter what commercials we seen, or what car accident we have witness, we still text and drive and it's a fact.

In this generation, texting and driving have been the leading cause of car accidents, especially for teenagers. A lot of teenagers are losing their life cause of texting and driving. Most people think texting and driving are underrated. Some teenagers think that other teenagers that have an accident while texting and driving just don't know how to drive well. So they do it because they think that they can prevent it from happening to them because they can have control of it. The importance of texting while driving should be addressed to anyone obtaining a valid driver's license and can operate a vehicle. This particular proposal should develop a direct impact on life because it can help many people to understand what would happen and hopefully teach them a lesson of the consequence when you text and drive. People really need to know and understand how easily it is to take theirs and someone else's life. Texting and driving is a serious hazard, which could ultimately cost you your life or others. This pressing issue needs well thought out ads that will convince people to act on this deadly habit and not just be aware of it.

And most of the time in many cases like this be happening to the age group of 18-25.

Not only is texting while behind the wheel bad enough itself, many people compare the danger level to drunk driving. Driving while intoxicated at the same time is illegal, just as some believe texting while driving should be as well. Drunk driving is another top cause of car accidents that happen every day. If people were more aware of how closely related texting while driving and drunk driving are, it would help to inform all drivers on safety behind the wheel. All of these hazards on the road are making other drivers very nervous. Texting while driving puts many driver's lives in danger daily. Multiple people feel that staying connected to the outside world is more important than focusing on the road ahead, although it isn't. It can harm others on the road who are doing nothing other than trying to make it to their destination safely. If people would open their eyes to the dangers of texting while driving, less car accidents would take place every year and the roads would be much safer. Distracted drivers need to know the position they put others in as well as themselves. While behind the wheel, drivers should never direct their attention to their cell phone and should always keep their eyes on the road.

It is obvious that texting and driving is extremely dangerous, but the majority of drivers continue doing so. Even with all the stories of disastrous car accidents transpiring as a direct outcome of distracted driving, teens and adults are still texting at the wheel. Overall I think a phone shouldn't be allowed in cars while driving. People should put their phones away like in their purse or somewhere it can't cause a distraction to them, because I know for fact that as soon as that phone ring or a notification comes on most people would reach for that phone, and it's at that moment their focus on the driving is lost. If people follow that rule, I think the rate of a car accident would decrease, and people would be alive and well. Today, texting while driving out numbers the amount of drunk driving according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Texting while driving is ten times more likely to cause a big accident than drunk driving. You are 23 times more likely to have an accident if you are texting.

A phone is just now a big part of the society today. Most people would rather text than to have an actually a physical conversation with someone. Phones become very distracted. Many accidents happened because of phones. For this reason, many states are making new laws designed to curb such risky habits amongst drivers and enhancing safety on the road for others. In conclusion, texting while driving is a big issue, we are doing it every day and not realizing how much we are putting our lives in a danger and even the others people. Leave the phone alone or at home while you are driving because a text is not worth your life and somebody else's, that text will be there when you done driving or when you get home.

Cell phone usage while driving is one of the most causes of accidents to young teen drivers. In the United States,motor vehicle accidents due to distracted driving is increasing. While most people are aware of the risk of using a cell phone while driving, they still continue to take the risk anyway.. Texting while driving causes a 40 percent increase in accidents because of the time spent with eyes off the road. Of all cell phone related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity.

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us.

Driving is not something to play around with especially for young drivers. It's responsibility to them and putting trust from their parents/guardian to not be in any big accidents. Because of how much death that have been occurred from the cell phones, they have legally made a law about the use of cellphones. Since then the toll numbers of death especially to young drivers have been dropped. Even though the bars have been drop we still got those kind of people who don't care about the law and still take risk their own lives with texting or being on the web while driving.

As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. As each year go by I can see that the government are doing their best to reduce the death toll of car crashes but one more title they soon gotta check up on is the deaths from drunk driving because they are the 2nd most cause of deaths in car crash just from drinking and driving.

Therefore, I believe that people should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Just recently in 2018 Georgia has just made a law called the ""Hands-Free-Law"". Reading from a phone or using it to record video is banned, too, according to the Governor's Office of Highway Safety, including at stoplights. Those caught breaking the rule even tapping ""play"" on a Spotify playlist while not parked, face a $50 fine, which doubles upon their second offense.

Cell phone use while driving has become the largest cause of automobile crashes over the last two decades. Using a phone while driving can cause distracted driving and even worse car accidents with fatalities. With drivers being distracted, it decreases their awareness on the road and leads to more car crashes. According to the United States Department of Transportation, in 2017, distracted driving claimed 3,166 lives in that year alone. Mobile phone use while driving distracts drivers in two ways; physically and cognitive distraction. Although many laws have been set in place in order for cell phone usage while driving to be banned, many ignore the law and still use cell phones. With this information being concluded, many feel as if drivers should not be able to use cellular phones while driving in any capacity.

There are many benefits from decreasing the number of drivers who choose to use their cell phone while driving.

In different states there are different cell phone law variations, but all do the same, they intend to prevent drivers from driving distractedly. Although, these laws are set in place, many do not adhere to and follow these laws. Furthermore, no state has banned the use of cell phones while driving, just adamant enforcement and strict restrictions. For example, fifteen states enforce the handheld cell-phone use law, which prohibits all drivers from using hand-held devices or cell-phones while driving. In addition to laws being put in place, if caught being on a cell-phone while driving, there are fines put in place.

On the other hand, there are many precautions that should be followed to prevent the use of cell phones while driving. Firstly, keeping your cell phone out of arm's length reach it should prevent the use of it. Secondly, if in a situation where a text message must be sent out, do it before driving and let whoever is being texted that you will be unreachable for a certain amount of minutes. Also, silencing a cell phone could be the difference in a life or death situation. Lastly, simply just keeping your focus on the road and not anything else could save a life.

Although cell-phones have detrimental effects on driving, they also have helpful factors as well. Many cell-phones have GPS systems that many people use while driving. Also, rideshare companies use cell-phones as a way to find riders and the drivers even use their cell-phones for GPS reasons. Furthermore, cell phones allow their users to make calls in the case of an emergency. For example, in the case of a serious car accident, where time is of the essence, cell phones are there for paramedics to be contacted immediately. Lastly, being able to use your cell phone while driving, permits you to be able to call authorities if they witness suspicious activity they have seen while driving.

Finally, using your cell-phone while driving has its' pros and cons. More importantly, its' cons. Cell phone related car accidents and fatalities continue to increase despite the legal legislative action by the states' government that prohibit specific cell phone related activities while driving. Regardless of the educational attempts about the risk of distracted driving and cell phone use to warn the general public, many refuse to abide by the law. In conclusion, drivers, in any capacity should not be able to use their cell phones while driving.

Everyone has phones these days. People are debating the issue on cellphones while driving. Cellphones are not good for you while driving.

Cellphone use is bad for driving because you could crash or die. one reason for this is you could be distrated. distration can happen by you just trying to change the music. A crash could be in a spilt second by you taking your eyes off the road.

If you're ooking at your phone texting, you could swerve and cause a wreck that can hurt you and other. One question you ask yourself while driving is does it make sense to you to be on my phone or changing music? Sometimes these small problem could lead to you causing a wreck. The traffic lights are sometimes people could be palying on there phone, and miss a light and cause traffic.

Playing on your phones is terrible while driving. You could cause damage to yourself and others. If you're driving fast people could swerve and hit something. I hope that a new law will pass, so people could drive safe, and get home okay.                                                                     ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on the daily basis. Many people in today is society who own cell phones operate them while they are driving. Drivers shouldn't be allowed nor able to use their cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

The usage of cell phones while operating a vehicle is a very debatable topic. One example of why cell phones should not be used because they take the person is attention off of the road. The usage of a cellular device is dangerous especially when it comes to operating a vehicle. People using a phone will be too focused on it and that could lead to an accident.

Fines have been placed as a consequence for cell phone usage. The fines are to get fewer people to use their phones, but it really is not much of a help. Many think they should be able to use their phones so the fines do not really mean much to them. For example, people say if you do not pay this phone bill then you shouldn't be able to tell me what to do with it. In the other case many people do it without thinking about what could happen and how it could greatly effect themselves or the people around.

Suspension of license is also another consequence of driving while using cell phones. There is so much that can be looked over but it only takes that one time to do it to the point where you are affected. Some people will abide by the rules of driving without the use of a cellular device while there are some who do not. Everyone cannot be spoken for, although the majority can be put into the category of people who use cell phones while driving.

In conclusion, the usage of cell phones has many reason as to why it shouldn't be allowed. In my opinion, it is better to be safe than sorry in any situation that deals with driving. The life is of yourself and others is what really matters at the end of the day. Waiting until you get home or your destination to use your phone should always be the route that's taken. People should always think of others and yourself before you decide to use a cell phone while driving.

People always have something important on their phone or have someone important that they're talking to but is their lives really worth texting someone? There are so many cases of people losing their life while texting and driving. People shouldn't be able to use their phone while behind the wheel of a car.

Is a text message more important than your own life? The person you are or they have been texting could wait but the car you are driving can't and requires all the alertness you have in order to be safe behind the wheel. Your life and the lives of others are always at stake when you're are driving. There already so many accidents happening on the road and one of those main causes of those accidents happening are caused by people who were texting and driving. There are laws saying that it is illegal for you to be texting and driving.

If you were to cause an accident because you were texting and driving and end someone's life because of that accident you will be held responsible for that person's death and will actually serve time in jail or in prison. Throughout most of the states of the United States of America it is actually very illegal for someone to be texting and driving.

You will actually be charged if you get pulled for texting and driving because you are risking your life and the lives of others on the road.

I personally think that it shouldn't be something people should be doing in general. Mostly because the lives of others are at stake when someone is texting and driving and could actually lose their life because of it. It distracts the driver from focusing on the road and so many things could go wrong on the road whether there is a drunk driver or construction. Texting isn't as important as your life and the lives of other people.

Texting and driving isn't something people should or do in general. Luckily there's laws saying to not text and drive but some people don't listen and there is still risk of accidents happening because of this. People should see the bad side of texting and driving rather than answering someone's text message.       ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6
F64E9813C64A,"Many people think texting and driving is a good idea because they think they can multitask. They believe they are above the law and won't get caught. But they don't understand the effects that is causes. There are other people who think texting and driving is a complete no go. I agree with the people who dislike it. There are many reasons why you shouldn't text and drive. To the punishment in the eyes of the law to death.

A lot of individuals have lost their life due to using an electronic while operating a vehicle. In 2015 about 4,000 people were killed in crashes involving drivers whom were distracted. In a yearly basis there are 1.6 million car crashes involving texting and driving. It is also known it is 6 times more likely to cause an accident than a drunk driver. Noting the fact that being on a cellphone while driving equals to having a alcohol level of 0.8.

The justice system comes into this subject because of what punishment would the person receive. Tickets could range from $20 - $500, depending on the state. It could result into a misdemeanor charge. If there is a incident that eventually leads to injury or death to another driver, it could lead to jail/prison time. In Georgia if you are pulled over for this ticket start at $50. It will only increase by 50 each time. It could also lead to getting points on your license as well.

Before you get a ticket for texting and driving do these following things so you wont be temped to text or call someone. Put your phone out of reach. This will prevent you from grabbing it. Download apps that block incoming calls/text. With this app the only tie it will let you text or call back is when you are stopped and parked. If you need to use your phone for directions, invest in a cellphone dash mount. Following these simple things could save your life and possibly others.

Stopping texting and driving is a goal in todays generation. It is also known that texting and driving will never be eliminated. But hopefully a majority of people stop there will be a decrease of accidents. Hopefully the number of fatalities will also go down, causing less people being in jail for possibly injuring someone. By putting phones out of reach or by buying a dashboard mount.    ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6
8E4D2C7A75EF,"Its 11 am, and you're driving to your favorite restaurant to get lunch, you decide to check your phone while driving to text your friend; as you're typing your message, you run a red light and get side-swiped by another car. Texting while driving can lead to a potentially fatal series of events; not only for you, but for others around you.

Many people think they should be safe if they only check their phones for a short period of time. This is negligent of the fact that a quick glance at their phone could be all it takes to get into an accident. If you're driving on a highway, and decide to check your phone for a minute; the distance you would travel without looking at the road would be the length of up to 500 cars.

Imagine how many accidents you could get into if you consider the fact that people need to slow down, or change lanes.

Not only does texting pose a danger, the constant thought of notifications, and texts that you might be alerted to can be dangerous. If you can't focus on driving, and you keep getting notified of more and more texts or social media feed updates, you would be more convinced to check your phone. The safest thing to do would be to keep your phone on ""do not disturb"" or ""silent"". If you don't think about your phone, the safer you will be as the temptation to use or check your phone would be diminished.

Now you might be thinking, ""What if there's an emergency, and I need to be contacted immediately?"". The safest thing to do would be to utilize what most cars come with, the ability to call someone without using your phone directly. In that case, instead of being texted, you could call, or be called. If you're on a phone call, you can still keep your eyes on the road, and there's less of a danger.

Drivers should be allowed to keep their phones on them while driving, but be limited to only calling. You can easily call someone without taking your eyes off the road in most cases; if you have a car that can act as the medium to call someone.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

We all remember that teams are tied to their cell phones, which is why texting and driving is such a great fear. Most teenagers don't find the real risk of texting while driving, as these texting and driving facts for teenagers can appear. Distracted driving is the hot-button subject matter, particularly when it comes to the younger generations. We get attached to our cell phone while behind this machine, but adolescent drivers are the worst offenders. This is a scary idea, as distracted driving is dangerous and harmful on its own. However add that with the ignorance of the teenage driver and we are talking about a real dangerous combination.

To start off, even though the risk of texting while driving are well-documented, that has done very little to stop adolescent drivers from doing so. Some people question why there are so many commercials about texting and driving. That is one of these numerous reasons. teenagers and even adults don't consider how dangerous it actually is. The fact of the matter is that texting while driving takes the persons away from the road, severely increasing the chances of a crash. Moreover, teenagers that text while driving are proven to be out of this way within 10% of their overall driving period, as their thoughts are off the road and they aren't paying attention to the direction of their vehicle.

secondly, the fact that teen drivers are usually the least skilled motorist on the road may make the information about texting while driving that much more difficult to tell, considering that most teens think that they are very skilled at what they are doing.

some states have attempted to enforce that texting while driving was bad among teens and adolescent drivers by establishing a particular band against the practice. Some states have still yet to give such a cell phone ban for inexperienced drivers. According to, Teensafeblog ""11 teens die every day as a result of texting while driving. Teen drivers are four times more likely than adults to get into car accidents while texting or talking on the cell phone. this shows how connected and attached we are to our cell phones no matter where we are at the risk that can take place. Some teams have even put on themselves that texting at a stoplight is okay because you are not moving and no one can be in danger. This is not true. You need to have just as much attention on the road when at a stop light as if you're on the road moving. you need to be cautious of your surroundings and who is around you at all times, even when halted at a stoplight.

A2A4548C52DA,"Phones have come a very long way since 1973, phones have gave us the power to communicate with someone miles far away. People fell more in love with them once the first touchscreen phone came out. Now people have to have one, all you see nowadays is people walking or driving with their phone glued to their eyes. Major companies come out with a new one every year and they come out with one that has better features, a bigger screen, and a new software.

Cars have been out for many years and car accidents have happened a lot in each year. Accidents due to phone usage leads to 1.6 million deaths and that should be lowered each year. More and more people still use their phones while driving but it's a bigger percent of adults who use them while operating a vehicle. The people driving think they can multitask but imagine just driving to the store down the street and you look at your phone for a quick second, but then when you look up all you see is your life flashing in front of you. I don't think driving and using a phone is eligible at any time because driving safely is better than taking a life.

Drivers should be more cautious when driving because you never know if the person next to you is using the phone while driving. Georgia came out with a law this year where if you get caught with a phone while driving you will get a ticket. Georgia is starting to take more responsibility on the hands free law which is good because we are getting tired of hearing someone's son or daughter being ran over due to a driver not looking at the road when they need to. Adults who have been through that are probably in jail and some say they can't live with it on their conscious, they feel the pain they put the child's family through. They encourage people to please put the phone down while driving because they say it's not worth looking at a text and taking a life.

The rate of jail inmates keeps raising and in order to drop this number we as people have to encourage people to stop texting and driving. People feel bad about losing someone due to this situation but then go on the road while using the phone in an operating vehicle. Once reality hits them in that moment I think people would than start to make a change. Cars should have a sensor where if it detects that you are on the phone the car will automatically not cut on and won't let you drive until your phone is put up. If the car detects that you're on the phone while driving it will automatically pull over and cut off and won't cut on until you put it away.

You can cause damage to people and even kill people from not paying attention to the road. According to google over 1.6 million car crashes happen all over the world and is putting a dent in the human population.

Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. A growing body of research shows that driving while using a cellphone can create dangerous distractions. However, many states do not have bans against the use of phones while none have forbidden the use of hands-free devices. Opponents of the idea claim that cellphone bans are difficult to enforce while others claim that drivers also engage in other distracting activities such as eating, listening to music, and arguing with their children. Nevertheless, a review of the statistics indicates that cell phone use, even hands-free increases the likelihood of fatal incidents which provides justification for the bans.

Hundreds of research studies across the world have highlighted the various risks of cell phone use among drivers. Having conversations on a phone while driving increases the likelihood of fatal incidents by 400% (Walsh et al. 1896). Therefore, cell phone use creates more risk than other distractions such as reading billboards or having conversations with passengers. A study sponsored by the Harvard Center of Risk Analysis concluded that use of phones while driving contributed to 6% of crashes (Delgado et al. 17). Texting and driving also present a significant problem especially among the younger generations. Research shows that drivers using mobile phones decrease their visual scans of the road, have a higher probability of weaving in their lanes on bends, and have slower reactions to hazards due to having one hand off the wheel.

The act of conversation itself also creates a distraction. While focusing on the road requires a certain amount of cognitive processing, the complexity of conversations also engages cognitive resources. MRIs indicate that during driving, people exhibit extensive stimulation in the parietal lobe of the brain mainly associated with spatial processing. However, when performing dual tasks, such as having a conversation, activity in the temporal lobes rises significantly signifying processing of auditory stimuli (Fitch et al. 712). The rise in temporal lobe activity corresponds to a large reduction in parietal-lobe activation which indicates that conversations require more attention which is diverted away from the driving task. If a driver chooses to prioritize a conversation, then it reduces their focus on the road, thereby increasing the likelihood of a crash. While some may argue that the use of hands-free devices reduces the risk of a crash, research provides contradictory results. A study on the cognitive effects of talking on cellphones concluded that while participants often crashed while chatting, drunk drivers had reduced likelihood of a crash (Lipovac et al. 136).

Current legislation on cell phone use while driving is limited as legislators do not acknowledge the risks of both hand-held and hands-free cell phones. Moreover, opponents of the motion claim that such laws are unenforceable due to the resources required to monitor all drivers. However, a review of a person's billing records can determine whether they were using a phone while driving. Moreover, aggressive enforcement may also deter other drivers from risky activities.

Despite the risks associated with cell phone use while driving, most states remain hesitant to implement appropriate bans. Statistics indicate that cell phone use accounts for a significant portion of car crashes due to the limited focus on the road. Bans would work to increase awareness of the dangers in addition to reducing fatal incidences.

62185A8460AB,"Phones and driving,The main meaning behind a phone is to have communication that's why it was created now the question is should we or should we not use our phones during driving. We need our phones for one thing and that's calling,Anything else other than calling could may or may not result in a crash or even death. Phones today are mostly used with teenager behind the wheel and there has been many accidents of teenagers using their phones while driving. Phones theses days cause many distractions while driving but that is their choice to pull out their phone while driving. So in my opinion i think we should have our phones while driving,so now let me explain why.

Phones,Now a days we use phones for many other things other than calling. Our phones has been changing and still changing and adding more options other than communication such as apps. Apps are mobile applications that you can download on your phone. There are just so many things that we can do on our phones,we may wanna take a picture while we on the road or we may wanna watch a movie on our phone but like i said before we need our phones for many reasons and i'm not just speaking teenagers i'm speaking for everybody because now a days we live and run on our phones so only thing i can really say about texting or anything

That has to do with a phone in driving is stay safe.

Conclusion,in my opinion everyone doesn't need to have a phone while driving but no one is going to make a law saying we shouldn't have a phone while driving. It's just not gonna happen because it would not be a suitable law to create when everyone around the whole world has phones and use them while driving. We the people are just gonna have to be more careful when behind the wheel while driving.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Driving a car doesn't take that much IQ but then you couldn't say that because why would there be so many crashes per minute. No, driving is hard if you're bad at concentrating on more than one thing. Driving is a whole nether set of skills and it's not as easy but then knowing that your bad at one thing collides with your crazy fast texting skills makes you comfortable doing something dumb like texting and driving. That doesn't really level out with your driving skills but not everyone knows that! But then your mom texts you while you're switching lanes on i85 then BAM! You find yourself playing bumper cars at 79mph barely ending it all! Driving while texting isn't good for everybody but it certainly ant for everyone!

Some of these newer cars have addressed the fully automated phone utilizing Siri or even Alexa! This is probably one of the best things cars now days have to offer. Say you're driving and your mom text you, instead of playing bumper cars you could just tell your car what to reply back to mother! It's actual against the law not to have that feature in your car, not really but it should be. When you are doing your driving focusing is a level you have to raise the bar in and the more help you get on avoiding distractions the better.

Driving while texting is very, dangerous, bad, stupid, fun, and life threating! Being fun because we like to get that rush of sending a whole paragraph while still not playing bumper cars with other drivers on the road. Getting that excitement that you were texting and driving and totally avoided a bad accident or even someone's specific instruction that told you texting and driving was bad gives some people a little additive rush! However, just because you got away with it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, who's to say you won't get away with it on Sunday?

More than 50% of car deaths comes from distractions and more than 50% of those distractions comes from cell phones. Cell phones are nice to have but not while driving. Driving should have a way for you to put your phone down in a slot just for you to start driving. It is very dangerous and you could be risking your life and others as well around you. Driving with your phone out isn't good but when your eye sight goes to your phone instead of the road there is almost always something bad on the verge.

When on the road your attention has to be there as well! You have to understand that you're not the only one on the road and that individuals with families and kids that enjoy living want to keep living. When it's hard enough to concentrate on the road it gets 10 times harder to do so when having another screen in front of you. If you get caught with a phone in your hand while driving by and police officer they should react the same way as if your seatbelt were off! Safety and living will always come first. Phones are not needed at the wheel, your attention is!

For a couple of years now a lot of people have been dying, getting hurt, and a lot of car crashes happen because of texting and driving. No one ever realizes what texting and driving can do to a person and anyone on the road. If there is one person on their phone around a bunch of other cars that puts everyone else in danger no matter what. The phones is what gets everyone killed on the road because it is such a distraction to people behind the wheel and they don't have the patience to get somewhere then check it. Phones are pretty much taking over a lot of peoples life's because they are so hooked to it.

In my personal opinion people should not be able to use their cell phones while driving or when operating any kind of vehicle. It puts the person using the phone and all of the other pedestrians around them. Every cell phone company should make all their phones have censors in them for when people start driving their vehicles and would make the phone unusable. The worst part is that people could carless about the other people about themselves. That's why there is so many deaths coming from crashes because there is always that one person that is on their phone and not looking where they're going.

The fact that everything is on your cell phone makes it worse because you receive a notification and you automatically have to check it. People nowadays do not have the patience to wait to get somewhere to answer the message or whatever they receive. Everyone is basically addicted to their phones which isn't a good thing at all because as technology gets better maybe it could fix the being on your phone while driving or it can make it worse. If cell phone companies were to find a way to put sensors in a phone and then when they sensor you using your phone it automatically locks it. That would put all of the drivers in a better environment because now they won't have to worry about getting hit by a driver that is too busy distracted on their phone.

Putting sensors into phones won't be a bad idea but not everyone will buy the latest phone and getting drivers to not use their phone while driving will probably impossible. Companies can also change that if u get a notification it says it out loud so you won't have to pick your phone up. They could also make it to where you can only answer phone calls if someone wants to contact you instead of receiving text messages. Although they did pass a law where you get pulled over and given a ticket they are still not stopping texting and driving. There will still be those couple of people that still use their phones.

Basically to sum everything into one paragraph I was talking about how texting and driving is so distracting and putting all of the people around them in danger. It is not safe at all to be using your phone while driving and even if you are at a stop at a red light you still shouldn't pull it out to check something on it. When getting a notification you should just wait until you get to your destination and then check and answer it. Even with saying all of that people still won't understand how many people they are putting in danger and only worry about them selves. Just don't text and drive and wait till you get somewhere to answer the text or whatever you received.       ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Cell phones are a part of everyone's life in the twenty first century. Society uses them for everything from keeping up with social media, remaining in contact with people, personal entertainment and so much more. With so many people in possession of a cell phone, it is no surprise that they use them at inappropriate times. One of those times is while driving, the use of a cell phone while driving is not only dangerous but irresponsible. I think drivers should not use their phone while behind the wheel.

Driving while on a cell phone is almost as bad as driving while under the influence. In the article LiveScience, it says; ""Studies show that driving while talking on a cell phone is extremely dangerous and puts drivers at a four times greater risk of a crash,"" said Janet Froetscher, president and CEO of the NSC. ""Driving drunk is also dangerous and against the law. When our friends have been drinking, we take the car keys away. It's time to take the cell phone away"". This shows that not only is driving while on the phone four times more dangerous than driving without a cell phone but it is also as dangerous as drunk driving. Cell phone use while driving is also common amongst teen drivers. According to The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, ""3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States"". This statistic shows that multitasking behind the wheel is dangerous and becoming a life-long risk. Knowing these statistics drivers should take more caution and families should take control of this risk.

People might argue that they should have their own choice whether to use a cell phone while driving. In the article , Stop Texting and Driving ""Since each driver recognizes the potential dangers they could involve themselves with if they choose to text and drive, a law should not dictate a ban on texting and driving behind the wheel."" This statement from the article shows that people think they should have their own choice if they want to text and drive and it shouldn't be a law. Humans will always make mistakes while driving. In the the article FEE it says; Earlier government studies have repeatedly found other distractions to pose a far more serious problem than phone-related distraction. According to 2010 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data, cell phone distraction has barely budged as a fatal crash factor, ranked behind drivers being ""lost in thought."" This has not led to calls for nationwide prohibitions on daydreaming while driving"". In the year of 2010, cell phone use while driving wasn't the most dangerous thing to do while driving.

In the article THE ZEBRA, texting while driving statistics from 2012-2018 say that ""14% of distracted driving deaths were attributed specifically to cell phone use, as opposed to other forms of distracted driving.""

Using a cell phone while operating a vehicle of any stature is a bad decision and should be illegal worldwide. Not only is using a cell phone while driving irresponsible, it's also dangerous to yourself, as well as others on the road. If one does choose to talk, text, or even try and use their cellular device while driving should be penalized to an extent and given a heavy warning. Though a warning, ticket, or even time served may be all it takes to prevent potentially fatal accidents on the road, these methods don't always work. Therefore we, as citizens, and as drivers, should be careful and wise with our decisions.

Reasons why driving and using your cell phone is so dangerous spans on and on. Firstly, one's not fully capable of providing one hundred percent of their attention to a single task such as driving while using their phone. Due to this, using your phone while driving only widens the window for a potential wreck, whether fatal or not. Studies show that using a cell phone and driving has become one of the top leading causes of car crashes in the past twenty years. Secondly, when one is distracted on the road, they put people in danger without even realizing it. There have been many instances where someone who is using their phone, ends up tailgating the vehicle ahead of them, with that vehicle potentially having an entire family in it. Many fatal crashes have been caused by this very action, injuring or even killing those involved in the wreck simply because someone wants to talk, text, or look at social media. So please, if you're driving, try and restrain from using your cell phone until you are parked in a secure location.

Not only is there a wide range of dangers when using your phone and driving, there's also a long list of punishments that follow close behind. One of the main punishments for driving and using your phone is a fine. These fines can range anywhere from $150 to $500 or more depending on how many offenses you have. With such pricey fines, you'd think one would think twice before using their phone while operating a vehicle, but this isn't always the case. To counter this, those who repeat such actions can have their driver's license suspended for up to 90 days. Washington was the first to ban texting and driving state-wide with 38 other states following soon after. Some fines received in these states range from the minimum of $20 to a maximum of $10,000 and one year in prison. The average fine being around $150 to $375 in a handful of states. Insurance is another issue when it comes to using your phone while driving, with the coverage cost on your vehicle being affected. You see, the more of a risk you are on the road, the more you must pay on your insurance, so please drive safely.

Those who aren't fond of dangerous drivers should know how to avoid them and stay out of harm's way. One smart and helpful way to steer clear of those pesky drivers is to alert authorities. If you can, it's smart to try and obtain enough information about the driver and their vehicle such as a description of the driver or license plate. Calling 911 can be what saves you or someone else on the road from a potential accident. Another good way to prevent potential accidents is to travel when traffic is at its lowest. Driving in the early hours of the day can be a good time to drive, as well as work hours just before the lunch-rush. One would want to limit the amount of traffic on the road as much as possible in order to decrease the possibility of encountering dangerous drivers. Lastly, one simply needs to stay on high alert when driving. It seems like a no-brainer, yet many tend to not follow this basic rule of driving. Pay attention to details such as the speed you and those around you are going. Conditions on the road are also important, such as rain, snow, and ice. Remember that simply paying attention to the smaller details can prevent accidents on the road.

Whether or not you believe using your phone while operating a vehicle is as dangerous as it's portrayed to be, one cannot deny that it is a potential hazard. Many car crashes have occurred whilst using a phone and has become one of the leading causes of accidents on the road. Not only is it dangerous, but it is also illegal in most states and one could also be fined a hefty amount. It's simply a bad idea to text, talk, and overall use your phone while driving. Many tend to put responsible drivers in danger through these acts and fail to realize it until it's too late. Remember to drive responsibly, paying attention to those around you and how you drive. Your phone is not worth a life.       ",6,Phones and driving,Independent,1.0
EE3DDDA7F1B7,"Should drivers be able to operate a cell phone while driving? No, drivers should not use a cell phone while driving a moving vehicle. Its dangerous and very risky because you can be seriously hurt or be killed from anything once you take your eyes off the road.

Statistics show that multitasking behind the wheel is life threatening.

Talking, texting, or checking social media while driving takes the brain off the task of driving and can put you in a bad situation as an result. Its very dangerous for you and passengers in the car. Most importantly children if they are along with you inside the vehicle. Once your eyes are taken off the road , you're putting everyone's life in danger no matter the reason for why you took them off the road. If you take your eyes off the road for not even a second , then BOOM, you're flipped over inside your car and whoever is in the car with you is either dead or severely injured.

Using your mobile phone while driving can cause a number of bad things to happen. For example, a car crash. You could be changing a song on your phone and the out of nowhere a car pulls out in front of you going slow and you ram him or her in the back because you was on the phone while operating a moving vehicle. And when you and the other car make contact your car flips or the one you hit flips.

Anybody can be hurt.. even by standers, that's why its important to focus on the task at hand which is driving. This is the only way the prevent mistakes from happening and could save your life and others.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
9520819E35C3,"""In a split second you could ruin your future, injure or kill others, and tear a hole in the heart of everyone who loves you."" And that quote is by Sharon Heit, mother of texting and driving victim. This essay is about, if drivers should or shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. There is a lot of pros and cons, on if people should or shouldn't be able to use their cell phone well operating a vehicle. As a teenager I see the good and the bad, but it doesn't always means that us teenagers will always listen or bother to do the right thing.

In my opinion cell phones use while driving shouldn't be allowed. Manly because there are more cons then there are pros. And if I was driving I wouldn't be able to text anyone because I can't multitask. And if I got into a car accident I wouldn't be able to handle hurting anyone or possibly killing someone. And I'm the type of person that don't like pain or going to the hospital.

If you don't keep your attention on the road bad things can happen. Including put others life's in danger, putting your life in danger, braking hearts of others and sometimes you're on heart, going to court if the victim try's to sue you. An example of putting other peoples life in danger, let's say if your boyfriend or girlfriend texted you and you saw it and you replied, and you happen to take both hands off the wheel and it happen that you can't take control of the vehicle and you get in a car crash. Taken both hands off the wheel can also put you in danger as well. And getting into a car crash isn't always safe people can die on the scene and you couldn't do anything about it, so that brakes others heart and possible yours.

The pros of cellphone used while driving: navigation, traffic reports, crime reporting, communication with a friend or a parents or if you have children. Now days, the cars have navigation in them. And if they don't you can have cellphone holders for your phone. Communication with a friend or even a family member about something that's going on, and you're trying to get to where they are. And if you have children and you don't know where they are and you're trying to get a hold of them.

This essay is about, if drivers should or shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. And I don't think people should drive and use there cell phone. There can be exception for using a phone when operated a vehicle. The exception can be about a death or a child, and of course navigation. And this is my opinion on if people should or shouldn't be able to operate a vehicle while driving.          ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6
AD887B08C14A,"Technology has advance so much within the last couple of years. It is crazy how people have easy access to it and are eligible to communicate with each other very quickly. Cell phones are the main source of communication and to this day everyone can not seem to get their eyes off their phone. In many aspects it is good that everyone has a form of device to get around because they do come in handy. Although technology is highly beneficial and has changed the way certain things are being done, it is important that people use it when it is the correct time. A cell phone itself consist of many helpful applications but there are some moments where cell phones should not be in one's hand and that is when they are driving.

Texting while driving is very distracting because the driver does not have full focus on the road. Within this situation, the driver has a very high chance in getting themselves in a car accident. The amount of car accidents that are caused by texting and driving are enormous according to article, ""Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving"" (texting and driving statistics). It is better to see a problem and avoid it then to just continue to follow through. When people are texting and driving, they are clearly putting their own life at risk which is awful. When the driver takes their eyes off the road, they are most likely asking for something bad. Even then it is proven that texting and driving is worse than an intoxicated person driving, as proclaimed, ""One study by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) concluded that texting while driving is six times more dangerous than driving while intoxicated"" (Steward law offices). People whom have a very easy temptation to touch their phone should not be driving just as those whom intoxicate themselves and then chose to drive. Ones life is at high risk and since this is a problem that is preventable, everyone should follow through because it endangers someone else's life.

When texting and driving not only is the life of the driver at risk, but also somebody else's. Imagine losing someone or being injured just because one could not put their phone down. It is important to at least be considerate because the numbers of texting and driving have just been going up, as enhance, ""The United States Department of Transportation reported the cell phones are involved in a whopping 1.6 million auto crashes each year"" (Teen Safe).

Enable for these numbers to go down, everyone needs to take put their phone down. As evidence shows, it is dangerous to be on your phone rather to be intoxicated which means being on your cell phone and driving should be banned all over the world. One may assume because drinking and driving is a crime so would be texting and driving, but in worst matters it is not. In the U.S there are some states that have acted, ""Currently, a patchwork of laws governs cell-phone usage by drivers. Some 35 states ban text messaging while driving, 30 states ban cell-phone use by novice drivers, and 10 bans all use of hand-held cell phones, according to the NTSB"" (CNN). Although not all states have contributed to this law enforcement yet, some people should at least take this as advice. There could be countries that my not take this into consideration, but it is important that everyone does what is right so not everyone's life is at risk. When driving the driver should withhold full focus on the road and not on their cellphone.

Cell phone use while driving sets a distraction for the driver. It enhances them to multitasks which is nearly impossible to keep full attention on both the road and cellphone. It is better to drive safe then to live a miserable life just because one decided to be on their cell phone. As human beings everyone has important things on their cell phone like maybe an important call or even then an emergency, but nobody's life should be put in danger for something they did not do wrong. A lot of innocent people have had to be the victim in this situation. Before anyone even bothers to even start their car, it is important for them to take care of all their cell phone duty within that time period. If there is ever a moment that one may really need to use their cell phone it is better for them to pull themselves off to the side and take care of their problem because there is no need for this to become an innocent's person problem. Although this may sound like a broken record this is an ongoing problem that can easily be avoided.

A2B0C80404FD,"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. People do a lot of things with cellphone, but they should never be able to use phones while driving a vehicle. There are many reasons why you shouldn't. Car crashes, running red lights, and death.

First is car crashes. Car crashes are very common, sometimes it can be because people don't know how to drive, but they are mostly caused because of people looking down at their phone instead of looking at the road. These are liabilities because you can really hurt someone or even take their life. Texting and social media are taking all of the attention away from you looking at the road. Why not be smart and just put the phone down for a few minuets and just relax and drive. It can save a life

Next is running red lights. Think about all of the things that can happen if you run a red light. A major ticket, a bad crash, and even a life. Just all of the bad things that can happen. Just putting the phone down can prevent all of the bad things that can happen to you and your loved ones. Say your driving on a major highway, maybe I-95, there is an intersection in the middle of the road and you need to see the red light because its about to turn. If your looking at your phone and miss the light you can cause a major disturbance in traffic.

Last is death, Think about how many people you can kill in a car crash. Your driving and you pick up your phone and miss a turn, you hit a car and that car hits 5 more cars and sets off a chain reaction, All of those people have a probability of dying because of how fast your going and how hard you hit them. Now you can be charged with murder and that gives you life in prison. So think about that about that before picking up your phone.

In conclusion all of these reason are why you should not be able to use your phone while driving.      ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6
C9138DC25FD6,"People do use their cell phones on a daily basis but they shouldn't use their phones when they are driving. When you are driving and texting you can cause a car crash or something worse. The only time you should have your phone while your driving is if you have a hands free mode. It is better to not text while driving you see some people like to text while they are driving so their not paying any attention to the road and to what's in front of them.

That will cause them to get into the following accidents: car crash, running someone over, or going off the road. These accidents have happened before including if there is a kid riding with you. It will also cause meager injures to the drive and the passengers even the kid. That is why we create cars that have a free hand mode so that way you call or text someone without looking at the phone. They even have phone holders that you can attach to the fane of your car.

For example I am a person who is always on my phone everyday. One day I am driving my kids to their friends house but then I get a text message from my friend. I pick up the phone and I read the text that means i'm paying more attention to my phone and not to the road. At that moment when I'm reapplying to his text suddenly a car pulls up and I try to slam on the brakes but then I crash into the car. I am very injured from the crash and my kids are also in pain that is what happens when you are texting and driving.

99% of people have gotten into this kind of accident all because they were texting and driving at the sametime. If we all didn't have are phones when we are driving we could avoid these accidents and be safe. Even Some people who are texting and driving can even cause death to a person because they got ran over by a car. Phones are a distraction when you are driving because it claimed up to 3,450 live back in 2016 alone and it still is. It also caused 391,000 injured people in motor vehicle crashes involving distracted drivers in 2015.

Teens are the largest age group reported as distracted at the time of fatal crashes when texting. Back in 2013 about 1.2 million of car crashes have occurred all because of cell phones usage while driving statistics that had shown that this kind of behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. Texting while driving statistics show that doing this behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving, where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. That is why when people are behind the wheel they shouldn't have there phone when driving.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6
03676B73C27B,"Since Alexander Graham Bell first patented the first practical telephone, the spreading of information has grown exponentially. The development of the telephone became something otherworldly. Today, people are able to communicate with each other at the tap of just one button. As amazing as that is, it has become an epidemic that people can't get themselves away from. More and more frequently the case of people getting into accident because of being on their cell phone while drive has been on the rise. This addiction has seemingly been the cause of many accidents that could have been avoided if people would have not been able to use their cell phones in any capacity while in control of a motor vehicle.

To begin with, cell phones and other electronics require attention from users that can't be given when operating a vehicle. Because of this, many people find themselves trying to split their attention between the phone and the road and typically end up giving more attention to the computer that they are able to hold in their hand. This lack of attention to the road causes accidents with other motorists which could have been avoided if there wasn't a phone in the way of the driver paying attention to the road. For this reason, people shouldn't even be able to use their devices in any such way while in the driver's seat of a vehicle.

Moreover, amny drivers have the mindset that their own personal driving isn't what they have to worry about--it's others. With a mindset like that, it begs the question of how that can be possible when motorists use their cellphones while driving. There is no way for anyone to be able to multitask so well that they can operate their vehicle, use their devices, and worry about others as they make it to their own destinations. Many may argue that they have the ability to do such things, but it has yet to be heard of someone multitasking at such a high caliber.

Finally, while drivers use their devices, there is simply no telling what might happen in the blink of an eye. Drivers need to be fully aware of the roads and what happening around their vehicles, so there can be not time or effort that can be put into using their electronics in any way while also driving. If someone were to lose the concentration that they have on the road, the possibility of an accident and casualties sharply increases.

In short, people should not have the ability to use their cellphones in any capacity while driving because the possibility of something tragic happen will sharply increase and the chance of someone surviving an accident because of cell phone usage will continue to drop.

Should people be allowed to have a cell phone when driving is a no. I don't think that people should have one on them when driving. People already have a hard time staying off they phones without driving a car, they are already many cases of texting and driving, and lastly people who would be texting and driving would not just risk the lives of themselves but for other people as well.

People already have a hard time staying off they phones without being on the road. Any noise or vibration that they phones makes people stop everything just to look to see what's on they phone. While on the road, people should put they phones on silent mode to stop them from being distracted when driving. They are also other free apps that people can download to help stop them from looking at they phones.

They are many of police reports about people getting into bad/life threatening accident. It is a proven fact that 11 teens each day from texting and driving. It's also a proven fact that 9 out of 10 accidents on the road are caused by people not paying attention to the road. People that are on they phones when driving are not only putting they lives at risk, they are putting the other people on the road, people in the car with them, and also putting who are walking down the road also.

The people how would be texting and driving are not just risking their lives, they are also risking other people around them. When are not paying attention to the road and the people around them they tend to more accidents.

At the same time, drivers were less likely to be seen holding a cellphone or talking on a hand-held phone than in the prior survey.

The problem of distracted driving, especially cellphone use, continues to raise concerns. Texting and driving also appears to be a problem, especially among younger drivers. It is easy to understand why using a hand-held phone is a problem. In addition to having your eye on the road, with one hand on the wheel it is harder to navigate bends and respond to hazards. If the level of difficulty on the road demands a certain amount of driver concentration, but the state of the conversation also requires a depth of thought, then both activities will compete for a bounds amount of cognitive resources.

The use of a cell phone should not be allowed while operating a vehicle, I say this because distractions while behind the wheel has caused so much trouble. ""True Motion tracks five levels of distraction: Non-call active usage (texting and app usage); non-call passive usage (hands-free app usage); phone call in-hand; phone call hands-free; and no distraction."" Naturalistic studies in the future may provide the means to document the patterns and circumstances of drivers' phone use and their effects on real-world driving. Currently, the best studies of crash risk used cell phone Company billing records to verify phone use by crash-involved drivers.

In conclusion, cell phone use should be limited behind the wheel. Do you believe that cell phone use should be limited behind the wheel? A number of jurisdictions in the United States and around the world have made it illegal for drivers to use hand-held phones. It appears that drivers' phone use will continue to increase, despite the growing evidence of the risk it creates. More effective countermeasures are needed but are not known at this time.

BB2744686A59,"Have you ever wondered why people text and drive? Texting and driving is dangerous and can cause trouble, not only for yourself but for other people. I think people should not be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

According to www. thezebra. com/texting-and-driving-statstics/ ""Use of a cell phone while driving caused an estimated 1.5 million car accidents in 2017"". This shows that 2 years ago a lot of people were using cellphones while driving .I feel as if the government could have a system where they can detect phones while people are driving , which means officers can look in drivers cars and doesn't have to be there physically. I think this idea will help people stay focused on the road more and can help other drivers stay safe.

I also think people should not be able to use a cellphone in capacity while operating a vehicle because if you are focused on your phone and your at a stop , you can hold up traffic and you can get a ticket for holding up traffic. According to www. google. com ""a traffic ticket is $70 to $400 depending on your state law and or drivers records'.If you have a bad driver's record and have unpaid tickets you will have to spend time in jail, pay fines, and your licences can get suspended.

I was doing some research about texting and driving and according to www. google. com 49% american adults admit to texting and driving, and 90% of american adults know texting and driving is dangerous. Some people know how to drive and the consequences behind texting and driving and there are still car accidents pertaining a cell phone.

Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time.

So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

People think that driving under the influence is worst, which is not the case. There are many effects due to distracted driving.

Distracted driving is the number one problem that leads to many accidents. In many of those accidents, people die. "" In 2015, 37,461 lives were lost on US roads.""

A worldwide law should be made for no cell phone use. Citizens should know longer be able to touch a phone when their driving. There should be no hands-free technology either.

I think that using cell phones while driving is not the way to go because according to the law you can not drive,text at the same time simply due to the increase of crashing. Through out the recent years,more than half the populations drive and text which causes them to highly get into an accident. Using cell phones while driving can cause distractions to yourself therefore the accidents may increase rapidly throughout the years. I would prefer doing it when you're driving just because it is safer than driving. Operating a cell phones while driving can lead you to crash and will get you to a penalty for it. The safe way that I would say is to keep your cell phones off when you are driving because you'll get distracted to the cell phones once you pick it up.

The increase of the cell phone uses are very high simply to social media. Some say that there is no wrong in the doing of the cell phones use but I think that it causes many accidents and death rates to increase rapidly. The actions that many people take are actually risking their lives over a notifications on the phone and that will go horribly wrong to those whom use cell phones while driving. We have to follow certain laws from accidents and causing them. Everyday,there's at least some of the people such as young adults who text and drive all the time. Risking your life for something that doesn't have greater impact of your life is basically saying that cell phones are more important than paying attention to what the real world has.

During the years,many of the populations that causes theses accidents are young teens. Therefore,the death rate goes up throughout the years and some say that it's not the reason why. I feel like so many people look down into their phone then look up and see what's going on. For me driving and using cell phones is not the way to go for your life and for the safety,I would prefer you to always shut down your devices while driving so you don't get too distracted.

5DD3A198CF10,"In the United States, car wrecks because of distracted drive are increasing. The leading reason to distracted driving is cell phones. While most people appear to be aware of the dangers of using the cellphone while driving, they even continue to take this risk. What would it take to make people to quit utilizing their cell phones while operating their car?

Cell phones have become a part of many people's daily lives, making it a struggle for them to sit the down long enough to drive and reach their destination. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were calculated to have cellphones in hand while behind the wheel. Cellphone usage while traveling has become the number one cause for vehicle accidents over the last two decades.

Using the phone while driving increases not only the driver, but the people around them chances of getting into an accident. In addition to it lessens the driver's awareness of their surroundings while on the road, causing more car accidents. ""Auto deaths have risen for two straight years, marking the biggest increase in more than dive decades. While lower gas prices have encouraged more driving, distracted driving due to cellphones has been tapped as one of the major causes. That has prompted many states to begin cracking down on phone use while driving with laws outlawing the behavior."" (Pressman, A..Apr.2017)

An increasing amount of states, prohibit the usage of cell phones while behind the wheel, exposing those drivers who break the laws to fines and additional punishments. What many drivers don't realize is that, not only could they receive fines for using their phone, but they could also be served with serious lawsuits if they cause an accident.

A large number of drivers do not believe that their driving performance is impacted by the usage of their cellphones. More than one half of drivers who speak on cell phones while driving feel as if their driving is no different from them being off the phone. This shows that many people are ignorant to the impact they have on their selves and others when they use their phones while driving. This also shows why it's so important to have such strict rules and laws. ""Road safety appears to improve in states with laws that regulate driver's phone use. The states with the lowest amount of phone use while driving- Vermont, Oregon, Hawaii, and Washington- have all banned the use of handheld devices behind the wheel.""(Johnson, D.Apr.2018)

To sum it up, the use of phones while driving has proven to be a huge safety hazard to drivers and those surrounding them. There should be laws in all states and even countries that ban the use of any device or distraction while driving in order to decrease the number of accidents on the road. It would also help people to practice using their phones less and become not so dependent on their phones.            ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

While some see that there is no problem with texting and driving, there is a law that says otherwise. Texting and driving are not safe for any age citizens. Texting is a distraction from focusing on the road while driving. There is no multitasking when it comes to texting and driving. There have been too many car accidents that have been caused by people using their phones while driving. To reduce the number of deaths due to texting and driving cell phones should not be permitted by drivers in any capacity.

Georgia's Hands-Free Law came into effect on July 1, 2018. ( ""Georgia Department Of Driver Services, "" 2018). This law states describes that it is illegal for drivers to hold their cell phones while driving. Drivers are allowed to use GPS, voice to text features, and receive and make calls hands free. Earphones are the best to use in this case; however, a person can only use one earpiece at a time. This law will help to reduce the number of many accidents caused by distracted drivers from cell phones.

In general, citizens should not use a cell phone while driving. Being on the phone while driving increases the risk of crashing. Even if you are stopped at a red traffic light, it is illegal and not safe. If there is an accident for texting and driving, there are penalties. The penalties are based on the first, second, and third offense. At each offense, there is a monetary fee and points taken off of your driver's license. If a driver has too many offenses, this could result in the suspension of an individual's license.

Unfortunately, there is one thing that people cannot multitask in, and that is texting and driving. When drivers text their attention is divided when it should be focused only on the road. Texting and driving is a dangerous thing because you can injure or kill someone else or even yourself. When driving you not only have to be focused on the road but also you have to be considerate of others on the road.

After all, texting and driving is against the law and just is not safe. No matter how young or old you are, you cannot focus on driving and texting without being at risk of having an accident. To protect your own life and others do not use your phone while driving. If you want to use your phone, you should wait until parked off the road. That way, you will not get any tickets, nor will anyone's life will be at risk.

B0A19F407570,"Phones have evolved exponentially, especially from the twentieth to the twenty-first century. Over the course of ten years, phones without cords have become commonplace. Many individuals use them while shopping, cooking, and exercising. There also use them while operating a vehicle. However, using any device while driving can cost thousands of dollars and even your life. Cellphones should not be used while operating a vehicle.

The term distracted driving has become prevalent in courtrooms because drivers are more susceptible to the accessibility cellular devices, streaming services, and social networks provide. According to the auto insurance comparison search engine, The Zebra, approximately nine people are killed and over 1,000 people are injured from car accidents when one driver is preoccupied with their cell phone. This means that defensive drivers are not impervious on the road when another driver utilizes a cellular device. We, as a society, have the responsibility to keep others safe. The next time one sees their loved ones should not be on an autopsy table following an easily preventable car accident. The solution is to this dilemma is to enforce laws pertaining to cell phone usage and operators of vehicles.

New drivers already face the challenge of utilizing their defensive driving in their daily lives. Many drivers, both new and experienced, would say that a notification on their phone takes a second to acknowledge. However, those who check messages risk their lives. According to Miller&Zois Limited Liabilities Company, a law firm based in Maryland, five seconds of viewing a text message is the amount of time it takes for car travelling at fifty-five miles per hour to drive across an entire football field. Therefore, if an individual decides to look at a notification or respond to a text message, that person could enter a river or cliff at that same speed by using a phone while driving.

Citizens are not entirely at fault. According to the National Safety Council, cell phone use while driving is under-reported by law enforcement. This, in turn, means that too many offenders are only given warnings and no punishment for their reckless behavior. Tax-paying civilians are suffering because authorities do not hold offenders accountable for dangerous driving habits. Every state must outlaw phone use and produce punishments for those who continue to indulge in their distraction on the road, lest they seek for a steady increase in distracted driving injuries and fatalities.

Humans are said to be social creatures. However, social behaviors will limit the focus of drivers. A single second is an ample amount of time to lose one's life. Phones and driving are as compatible as water and oil. Do not post a picture, send a text message, read a book, or watch a movie when behind the wheel. Put the phone out of sight and out of reach.

992FC1053CE0,"I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because it causes many car crashes every year, it can make your car insurance go up even higher, and if you have a passenger in the car you should also think about their lives as well. People are more worried about who they're texting or who they're on the phone with. Driving while on the phone shouldn't be taken lightly because you are endangering your life and others around you. In this essay I will give you reasons why texting on the phone should be banned.

The first reason is that you can easily cause an accident while you're on the road. If you use a phone while driving it's basically like you're driving while drunk because you're not focused on the road as much as you think. ""Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving"". If you are texting while driving you're going to be more focused about sending that text to your friends or family than driving. ""One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on the phone consistently while driving"". That is the first reason why you shouldn't text and drive.

Another reason while texting while driving should be banned is because it can cause your insurance to go up. If you get in a car accident because you were texting instead of focusing on the road is bad because your insurance company will find out and they will raise your car insurance because of that. ""The more tickets you attract to your name because of driving while on the phone the more your insurance bill goes up"". If you cause an accident because you were on your phone then the bill to get there car fixed has to be paid by your insurance company. ""It states that the person that is at fault for a car accident caused by cell phone use their insurance company has to pay for the damage"". That is my second reason to why cell phones should be banned while driving.

My last reason why cell phones should be banned is because they could hurt or even kill passengers or pedestrians. Transporting other people in your vehicle is a big responsibility especially if you tend to use your phone will driving. ""Transporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, even though some young drivers fail to notice"". If you use your phone to send a text while driving with passengers in the car you are putting their lives in danger as well as other pedestrians. Most people probably couldn't live with the guilt knowing they caused someone to suffer a life altering injury or even death. ""Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle"".

That is the last reason why I chose to ban cell phone use while driving.

Laws banning texting and driving should be mandatory in each state. Many people do not realize that texting while driving can be just as dangerous as driving drunk. People should always be focused on the road then texting someone while driving especially if you just started driving. Those are my three reasons why cell phone use should be banned while driving.

It is very tempting to answer a text or a call while driving, but you should be aware of all the safety risks that come with making that decision. Most states have passed laws to make texting and driving illegal. Although most of the US has made an effort to persuade people to drive safely and avoid texting while driving, The National Safety Council reported that approximately 1.6 million car crashes are due to the use of cell phones. Lives of many are lost prematurely because of drivers who make the wrong decision and choose to text and drive. How many more lives have to be lost in order for people to understand that a text can wait?

Teenagers are the main and largest group that are implicated in consequential car accidents. According to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute, distractions are one of the main ""critical errors"" that lead to teens crashing. Teenagers who are new to driving don't have as much knowledge as an experienced driver. Taking their eyes off the road and checking their phones is a common and dangerous mistake that many make. Most adolescents know the consequences of being distracted while driving. As reported by Edgar Snyder and Associates, 56% of teen drivers admit to talking on the phone while driving, and 13% admitted to texting and driving. Being behind the wheel is a big responsibility. The driver not only has to think about being safe they have to think about avoiding any fatal injuries to themselves and/or others.

No state completely bans the use of cell phones for everyone completely. According to

Governors Highway Safety Association, 38 states ban the use of cell phones for teen drivers, and 21 states as well as D.C. prohibit cell phone use for bus drivers completely. Utilizing phones behind the wheel has serious a serious outcome. Premature death is one of the many results of drivers being distracted. There are consequences for those who break any type of law, and breaking driving laws is not an exception. Traffic citations, fines, loss of license, and/or jail are a few of the many consequences. Fines and jail time may increase if the incident keeps happening, if the driver is drunk, or if the driver or any other passenger is injured.

The person behind the wheel is accountable for getting to places safe. Driving is a big responsibility and should be taken extremely serious. Drivers need to understand that to get to a destination it is a must for you to follow the safety rules. Distracting driving is something that can be changed.

Humans use this vehicle to get from one place to another in a easier way. Cars have not always been a safe spot to be in. Many human beings have lost their lives because of a car accident. Technology and social media has had a big growth throughout the years and it has played a major part in car accidents. Phones should not be used while driving.

The first reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because you have a higher chance of getting in a car accident. Getting in a car accident is bad because you are able to lose your life or even worse, killing someone else. If you were to die in a car accident you would definitely leave your family destroyed. Imagine your mother and father having to bury you instead of the opposite way around. It's most likely that you will always live with the fault that you killed someone else. Putting the phone on the side and on do not disturb is something so easy to do than can benefit you in the long run.

The second reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because you can get yourself a ticket. You might not think that it's a big deal but it really is. A ticket can cost you a lot of money and sometimes trouble. A ticket can cost you more than what you would pay for your phone bill. Having a ticket means having a bad record. For any reason when you want to get a new job, They will be able to tell that you aren't a responsible driver and even worse not a responsible person. It's better to have a good record than to not have one and not be able to get the job you want.

The third reason on why phones should not be used while driving is because phones can be put on do not disturb. When your phone is on do not disturb you are not capable of receiving calls, text messages, and notifications from any of your social media accounts. You have to be able to control your brain and body. Your phone is not a need, It's not something you have to be holding every second/minute. Allowing your phone to be on do not disturb is allowing you to live a longer life and prevent a tragedy like a car accident. It's better to think soon than regretting it later when it's too late.

A phone should not be allowed to be used while driving because you can kill yourself or kill someone else, you can get yourself a ticket, and phones can be put on do not disturb. It's nothing new to watch the news and see that there's another victim of a car accident due to phones. People have to think better and make smart decisions on the road. Once you have your hands on the wheel you shouldn't take your eyes off the road. Accidents due to being on your phone can cause you stress in life and also capable of having bad memories.

You need to be 100% paying attention to the road and others on it. Most accidents happen when people are on their phones because your looking down. Also the person you are texting or social media page your on is not more important than your life. But if it's an emergency call you should answer otherwise put phones down you are taking other people's life for an electronic the phone isn't going nowhere but your life can. You should not be able to use your phone while operating a vehicle never.

Although, Georgia has made it illegal to be on your cellphones while driving people still do not listen. But, the accidents percentages in Atlanta and Gwinnett county has decreased by 30% that's a good start and if you come here you would see signs posted around talking about these things. We have to start convincing others to do the right thing because we don't want them to realize when it's to late. Also another solution is to enforce this law around the United States and more people need to get punished for it. That means that the law enforcement has to be on their job and not let people get away with it.

In conclusion, people need to stop being selfish and care about everyone else lives as well people have families to come home two. If more people enforce these rules you should see a change or if people just listen things will be different. Wrecks still happen besides this problem but majority happens from this and DUI.

I bet you didn't know that 26 percent of accidents are caused by people who were using their cell phones while driving. Here are some reasons talking about how using your cell phone should not be allowed while you are driving.

The first topic discussing how using your cell phone while driving is dangerous, is swerving.

Let's say you're driving and your buddy texts you, and you pick your phone up to answer the text, While you were texting your friend back you got distracted and swerved into another lane. It doesn't matter if it took you two seconds or two minuets to text something back; the point is your focus wasn't on the road, and because of that you are now in another lane. One example of this is actually one that happened to my family and I while we were on a trip. The car in front of us kept going off the side of the road, and kept swerving in between the two lanes. When we finally got over and got around him, we saw where he was distracted by his phone. When you get distracted and start swerving, you are putting the people around you in danger, which is my next topic.

When you are driving and you are paying attention to your phone rather than the road, you are putting the people around you in danger. An example of this would be something like; say you're driving, and there is a wreak ahead and the car in front of you stops. However you had no idea that they had stopped because you were too busy looking at your phone. Say you don't stop in time and you hit them. Or say you slam on your breaks at the last second so the person behind you, hits you. What if you can't stop in time so you have to swerve over. In any of these situations you have put someone else, and yourself in danger. Plus on top of that you could have caused an accident. That takes us along to my next topic, accidents.

Accident can happen anywhere at anytime, and can be caused by anyone doing anything. But like I said before 26 percent of accident are caused by drivers on their phones. I'm sure everyone has heard their own story about an accident that has happened because someone was on their phone. However one that really just sticks out to me is one my family and I saw the aftermath of. We were driving up to Atlants on weekend. There wasn't much traffic on either side of the interstate, it just looked as it usually does with Atlanta traffic starting to kick in. A little further down the interstate on the other side there was a ton of traffic. We looked as we went by all the fire trucks and police cars, and there was an 18-wheeler and a smaller car. The smaller car was up under the front of the 18-wheeler. Later that night my parents had the news on and it said that the driver of the 18-wheeler was on their phone and had gotten distracted. They wern't paying attention to the road or what was in front of them and somehow ran over the other smaller car.

Twenty-six percent of accidents are caused by distracted drivers on their phones. Being distracted by your phone while driving can cause swerving, putting others in danger, and accidents. If you are swerving while you're driving, you are putting the people around you in danger, and that could lead to an accident. This is why I do not believe cell phones should be allowed while driving. So next time that you're behind the wheel, think before you pick up your phone. You don't want to be part of that 26 percent because you couldn't wait to open your friends Snapchat.         ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Being distracted while driving is very dangerous. According to edgasnyder. com, people are six times more likely to cause an accident by being distracted than being drunk. Think about this, you are in the car driving, going sixty. There's no one around for miles and you get a text asking when you are going to be home. However instead of pilling over and answering it, you take fifteen to thirty seconds answering it. Thinking you can reply quick without any worry.

People don't stop and consider the dangers of texting and driving until they are out of the car.

Anything could happen on the road and they wouldn't know about it until the last second and have very time to react. Texting and driving is extremely dangerous and everything that is texted isn't important enough to end your life over.

Today, The majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basic.

When going to work, School, and so much more. Humans also use cellphone while driving drivers should not drive while texting or talking on the phone. It to dangerous in the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones. In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day, while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades.

Drivers who text when behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash.

Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done. But there a good system call ""handsfree"" an adjective describing equipment that can be used without the use of hands (for example via voice commands). That's a safe way to call someone without touching or seeing the phone. Overall, It may be said that texting while driving is bad and maybe just put your phone on Do Not disturb mode.

The usage of cell phones instantly grew after the introduction in the 1980s. One of the primary reasons they have grown in popularity is cell phones allow people to communicate from all over in a matter of seconds. Due to the fact cell phones are such a vital part of lives, phone use while driving has become a definite safety concern. Adults spend an average of 45 minutes a dav on social media. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration noted 1,830 motor vehicle accident fatalities for young drivers, according to teendriversource. org. Many of the accidents were from distracted cell phone use. Cell phones should not be used in any capacity while operating a car for fear of distractions, higher insurance rates, and increased accidents and fatalities.

Cell phones being such an essential item in today's society, people find it hard to let go of cell phones while diving. Phone holders and Wifi have been added to many vehicles to enable hands free cell phone use while driving. Participating in any activity while driving, other than watching the road and their surroundings, creates distractions. Texdng, calling, reading tex ts, or sin1ply holding a phone to your ear can cause a momentary attention distraction. In a split second these distractions can cause a major accident. Phone usage is so dangerous because drivers are distracted with manual operation, visual reading, and cognitive processing (Bonner).

Accidents are financially costly to all parties involved. Car insurance can double when accidents are caused by phone usage. For drivers at fault in accidents, rates increased more than

$500 (Moore). The number of accidents determine car insurance rates for the area. With more accidents due to cell phones, rates have increased overall. All drivers are paying in some way for the irresponsibility of distracted drivers. Many states have passed laws to prohibit cell phone use while operating a car.

Using a cell phone while driving creates enormous potential for deaths and injuries on U.S roads. In the U.S., inappropriate phone use caused over one million car accidents (Edgar Snyder, n. a). Teen accidents with motor vehicle crashes involving fatalities were a result of distracted driving. When answering a text while driving, it takes your attention away for about five seconds. A great deal of things can happen in five seconds. Overcorrecting the car while on the phone has unfortunately been the cause of many fatalities. No conversation is worth human life

It goes without saying that cell phone use in any capacity while operating a vehicle is dangerous and threatens safety. Statistics support the reasoning for restriction of use while operating a motor vehicle. Distractions, higher insurance rates, and increased accidents and fatalities prove why cell phone use should be forbidden.

Do you ever catch yourself being on your phone more than you should be while driving down the road? In today's world we have had to put a lot of laws and regulations in place just to keep people safe. For example Georgia's hands-free law took effect July 1, 2018 with all new rules and regulations about cell phones being used while driving.

In my opinion parts of the law makes things safer but then some of it is a little too much. One thing that I agree with is that ""Even with hands-free technology, drivers cannot write, read, or send text messages, emails, social media content and other internet data while on the road."" I feel very strongly about this one due to there being so many people who have accidents while trying to send texts or look at the latest posts while at a traffic stop. Some parts are a little too much though, starting with ""Drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or touching any part of their body while driving. ""It would be crazy to get a ticket just for your phone touching you.

Phone usage in vehicles has its pros and cons. I think it's great to have a cell phone with you at all times any time you get in a vehicle to drive in case of an emergency. Also Cell phone usage usually causes emergencies. I believe drivers should be allowed to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle, but only hands free. Also they need to make the vehicles more acquitted to ensure cell phones can only do certain things in it.

For example care could not allow any texts to be sent or received. You also shouldn't be able to make hands free cells when going certain speeds. I also think they should bult in systems for teenage drivers where it sends notifications to the parents when they go over the speed limit, break hard or drive without a seat belt.

In conclusion I feel that cell phone usage in vehicles should be allowed. They create a lot of accidents but they also save lives by calling for help. Cell phones are a lot of people's lifelines. And should be allowed usage in cars!

Driving with any type of device can cause serious injury or even death.

If more of a risk was added to using a phone while driving then people would not do it.

It should be against road rules to use a phone, if anyone breaks this rule they should be punished.

One reason that drivers should not use a phone while driving is, if they have children in the car.

If a parent uses a phone while having children in the car can cause the parent and the children to become hurt.

There were 416,000 injuries from people using phones in 2020 alone.

This shows why using a phone while driving with kids in the car.

Kids may also grow to do the same thing if they see their parents doing it.

When that happens then all kids will be putting their life in danger.

To solve this Parents should be watched in order to prevent putting their children in harm's way.

This will ensure that all children will be safe In the future.

Next, is that the health of other drivers are in stake. Most safe drivers die or become injured from other drivers that are not paying attention.

There are people who actually follow the rules of the road that die from other drivers. When other drivers are doing what they are supposed to do but another driver isn't then both their likes are at stake. Not every driver breaks the rules, a lot of ppl like to keep themselves safe and keep others safe.

Finally new drivers will be affected by this as well. Newer drivers might be scared to get on the road bc of other drivers.

Most young drivers use their phone while driving as well. Teens today are all about technology which causes them to use their phone while driving. Tere should be more of a penalty if you use a phone while driving. It will slow down how many people get into car related accidents. With this in place then everyone will be so much safer while driving.

This is why no one should drive with a phone. It kills people and affects their lives. Something should happen if someone is caught with a phone while driving. Teens should be taught not to use phones when they are learning to drive.                                          ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

But we are being our own worst enemies when it comes to driving while on the phone it is Hard to that everyone knows at least one accident caused by using a cell phone while driving even if you can walk and chew gum at the same time, gum chewing is an unconscious activity. Talking on a phone and driving are not. People who think they are as alert talking on a cell phone and driving are probably the same people who think one, two or three drinks doesn't dumb down their driving skills.

I follow many drivers, of all ages, who start slowing down considerably or start swerving in traffic and there are not even young like me they are older people that could be the age of my parents that are driving reckless while on the phone like when they are looking for their phones to answer them, to call someone, or to text someone. This causes braking from everyone else that causes unnecessary crashes from everyone else. Cell phone use and driving is a distraction no matter who is doing it.

Cellphones is a deadly device to me personally because people that on our cellphones do not pay attention to what goes on around them. That's why it's important for us to not have them while driving.

Studies have shown that at least 6% of accidents have been caused by somebody using a cellphone. It seems that not only are drinking and driving dangerous, but using a cellphone behind the wheel is very dangerous. People in this generation believe that it's always dangerous if you text and drive. Just being on your phone period can be a dangerous situation for anybody, not just you. People believe that since you are not texting on the phone that it should be okay to be on the phone, I believe you shouldn't be on it period!

If we put our phones up and pay attention, a lot of accidents could prevent. We could have saved many lives. Cellphones are a huge distraction believe it or not, especially in today's society. It seems that the cellphone has become everyone's priority. That's why we cannot put them down for more than five minutes. Even talking on your phone is worse than texting, but texting is what people talk about the most. We should be talking about people being on their phones period .Just being on your phone can be more dangerous than anything.

See, driving a vehicle is already dangerous enough because you can easily end your or someone else's life. You need all of your attention on the road and what's going on around, so you can be aware. A cellphone will take your attention away from most of things around you. Texting while driving can take away from reaction time. If you're on your phone, it will give less time to react to a situation.

In conclusion, I believe drivers should not be allowed to drive while they are on a cellphone.

Cellphone are a huge distraction and with this distraction people can be injured or killed from using their phone. Instead of talking about texting while driving we should talk about us not using a cellular device at all when you're behind a wheel.

It is very distracting because if your focusing on your phone your not looking at the road. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing.

It is causing one's insurance to rise, and it is causing concern to people's health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. Cell phones support in making a direct contact with person effectiveness while driving. Using a cell phone while driving is dangerous and not advisable, it provides the convenience of tackling emergency situations , listening to music through hands-free, and tracking routes.

Driving while using a cell phone or drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a dangerous activity like driving. If you have this habit do not forget about this also. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising.

I will talking on why I think the people should stop driving and using they phone.

The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable,

It turns out that cellphone-use-while-driving laws vary depending on the state that you're in. If you're on a road trip across state lines, troopers might be able to pull you over for something that may be perfectly legal in your home state. You should also be aware of how distracted the other drivers around you might be.

Everyday people die in car accident, but most of those accidents are caused by people on their cell phones. This here is one of the biggest issues the world faces every day with drivers getting their self's in danger and others over a phone call or text message. If you think the slight chance that any of this isn't important and the world is just making a big deal about this, will then let me give a hand and give you a lesson. In 2011s Cell Phone and Driving Statistics, it's estimated that 23% of all car accidents each year are cause by cell phones use. That's 1.3 million crashes and 10 % of those car crashes have been fatal to many others.

Cause of these accidents many are wondering if people should or should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. If we were to have a week that no one could use their phones for while driving that long the amount of car crashes and accidents could possible or will decrease by the hundreds. Know yes there still will be car crash happening but not by phones anymore, but we really can't do that cause some people aren't going to give up their phones while driving. But there is a better option one that's already being put in place in many states and counties and that laws. Yes, laws are already being test or being placed in many states banning phones while driving now, but they all have a different way of solving this problem. In some states the law only effects teens under 18 or 21 from using their phones when driving hoping to dramatically decrease the chance of car accidents where in other states they don't allow ant one to use their phones at all, for example California has a law that any one 18 or above are ban for using their phones on the roads or anywhere while their using a car, same goes for Hawaii as well. With these laws we can finally decrease the number of crashes, want some proof? In 2017 the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that highway fatality numbers are going down for two consecutive years, it even led in to the first six months of 2018.

Have you ever been riding in the car and looked over at a red light and saw someone on their phone? I see it all the time when I go places with my parents, though we know it is illegal today in GA and other state people still do it. Driving is an activity that requires all your attention. My mom would always you are not only driving for yourself but for everyone on the road. No one should be able to use their cell phone while operating a vehicle to ensure safety for all drivers and even pedestrians.

Being a driver means you are responsible for your life and others driving and existing around you. Unfortunately, driving accident statistics gathered by edgarsnyder. com says, 1out of every 4 accidents in the US is caused by phone use while driving. That is a large portion of accidents and if we cannot use our phones while driving to rid a quarter of accidents then its worth it. The countless amounts of stories about parents and friends losing loved ones to accidents is an untimely loss that can never be justified, and we should do everything we can to spare people from a hurt such as that.

Outside of accidents leading to loss of life because of cell phone use while driving there is also the issue of distractions. A cellphone is like a computer, a MP3 player, a videogame and many other entertaining things wrapped up in one. Using this addictive piece of technology while driving is like asking for a distraction and distractions or lack of awareness of the road leads to car crashes. There might not be any deaths, but a car crash is still something to avoid. Raising your car insurance? A bad thing. Having to get your car or parent's car repaired? A bad and expensive thing. A distracted driver is a driver more likely to crash and damage their own and others' property.

There are some cars that have automated cellphone connection and touchless operations. Those vehicles do prevent the distractions, but you could still argue it is still just as bad as drunk driving. Your eyes may be on the road, but your attention is focused towards voice commands to your cellphone. It may be loosely related, but you can still be so focused on listening to that text and voicing a response that you alert enough for all the unexpected things that can happen on the road. People find that to be the compromise, but it's also seen as a mental distraction.

Overall cellphones just should not be matched with an activity such as driving. Driving should be a moment to unplug and focus even GPS can be used without the use of your cellphone. Cellphones have been proven to cause car accidents, distractions and crashes. Just keep your hands on the wheel, eyes on the road and attention focused and your cell phone will be waiting on you when you get to your destination.

9678506FBD4F,"Driving while using your cell phone has become a very controversial issue currently. Millions of drivers have had mixed feelings and opinions on this subject. In result, people have taken opposing sides. Some believe driving with using your phone isn't such a dangerous task, while others strongly believe it is an action that should never be done by drivers. They argue that this is very unsafe and can distract the driver from paying attention to the road. I agree. I believe that drivers should not use their cellphones while driving.

To begin, driving while using your phone is a very unsafe action. This is because this dangerous action diverts the driver's attention. Drivers are more prone to look at the phone to text or call someone.

When this occurs, drivers are less likely to pay attention to the road, the drivers around them, and their surroundings. Consequently, car accidents are more likely to happen.

On the other hand, some believe driving while using your cellphone isn't a distraction. However, this opinion is false. According to edgarsnyder. com, a credible personal injury law firm, it stated, ""Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving."" This statistic shows the absolute dangers driving while texting can cause. All in all, driving and using your phone is very dangerous and unsafe to the driver, passengers, and all people on the road.

In conclusion, driving while using or operating your cellphone is a dangerous act. Drivers should be paying attention to the road, not their phones. Cellphones offer huge distractions due to the easy accessibility to text messaging, video messaging, and all social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, SnapChat, YouTube, and Facebook.

Cell Phones are the biggest world problem, they have taken over the majority of million human life's. Most of the world uses their phones for communication and simply fun for themselves. Unfortunately, Phones are a very distractive device and can also be very deadly if used in the wrong moment.

Humans should not be able to have the capacity to use a phone while driving. The majority of the world think multitasking can come in hand while looking at the road and the phone at the same time. People are taking a risk in their own life and another person's life by making a dangerous decision. Driving with a phone in one hand and the other one on the steering wheel is not what society wants.

When driving most forget about many things and think they are on a road with no one else. It is easy to forget about sharing a road with other people especially when being distracted by phone. When anyones phones makes a sound when it goes off, everyone is always curious to see what is it. Whether or not if it is a text, call, social media like/comment or anything else can pop on a phone. Humans get the audacity to pick up the phone no matter what they are doing. It is against the law to pick up a phone or even make a phone call to anyone. By doing that people are not only risking their own life but everyones life who is on the road.

Hands free devices can still be a danger to many with a car. Many say talking on the phone with a cell phone connected to the bluetooth can also be very distracting. Due to the fact that humans having a conversation on the phone while driving, people are more focused on the conversation than they are with driving the car. In most situations , if you cannot simply wait to answer the phone then waiting at a red light might be acceptable or simply moving going to a parked spot.

Overall, cell phones should be banned on the road at all times to prevent anyone in danger from others. It may not be as convenient, but the world will not lose as many lives especially in the teenager area. A text, a tweet, snapchat, or instagram is not worth risking your life and others just to get a like or a text back. In the future, phones should not be the reason of deaths around the world and should not increase how many kids or adults have died because of it or someone else fault.

Some people think they have the skills to drive while also using their cell phones, but a large number of people disagree with that belief. People should not drive while using their cell phone because it keeps them from watching the road, it increases accidents, and it also increases highway fatalities.

First, people should not drive while using their cell phone because it keeps them from watching the road. Like texting while driving can lead to a ticket. Another one is answering and talking the phone could cause other to have road rage.

Secondly, people should not drive while using their cell phone because it increases the risk of accidents. Meaning when not looking at the road you could hit someone pet. Another one is when not pay attention to the road you could hit a tree.

One of the biggest debates in this country is whether or not cellphones should be allowed to be used while driving. Years ago, my sister and I were driving to school as if it was any other school morning. As we approached the green stoplight and midway through the intersection, we were rammed by a truck, who ran a red light. The man in the truck was charged for running a red light and using his cellphone while doing so. This is only one of many accidents that has occurred because of the use of cellphones while driving. Texting and driving can lead to a car wreck, a death or injury of a pedestrian, and are major distractions.

Car accidents are almost frequent every single day. According to the United States Census Bureau, in 2009 there were 11 million car accidents across the country. According to the National Safety Council, 25% of all car crashes are related to cellphone use, whether by talking on the phone or texting. Although many people think multitasking is always the answer, it is not the case when it comes down to driving. This is because phones are major distraction, probably the most distractive. Also, texting and driving can lead to the injury or death of a fellow pedestrian walking down the crosswalk. Any person on their phone can drive and accidently hit a pedestrian because the driver was too distracted to look down into their cellphones. Cellphones need to be away from the drivers' hands at all time.

Cellphone use can cause distractions and car accidents, along with the injury or death of a pedestrian. In many states, like Georgia, they have created a law where a driver cannot use his/her cellphone while driving. This law should be in effect nationwide to reduce the amount of deaths caused by accidents; due to the fact that the driver was using his/her cellphone.

Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four-time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous, and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always must be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So, the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepared to help you in an accident.

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.

My personal reason for this is because studies show that being on your phone while driving is a distraction. Everyone else has their own opinion and entirely different perspective and I can see how they would want phones to be legal. As I read more into the use of phones while driving I am introduced to more negatives then positives just because it pulls your attention off the road and even makes you take one hand off the steering wheel. So should drivers be allowed on their phone while driving?

My first reason for why people should not be on their phone would be distractions. Distractions meaning phone calls, face timing, and snap catting. All of the reason i gave are incredibly popular in today's youth and society. As a young and maturing person I use these apps or applications to my benefit when wanting to converse with friends and family. Driving and doing any of those is incredibly dangerous cause it takes your attention off the road and makes you even take a hand off the wheel.

My other reason for not agreeing with having a phone with driving is because it's not just a dangerous thing for you but also for others. In a scenario where two people are at a red light and the person in front is on their phone then how could they know the light is green? It all comes down to the person behind them if they are willing to wait or honk there horn at them. Scenario's like that because fender benders cause now picture if the light turned green and the person just pulled up a little bit and hit the person. Now the person on the phone is at fault for being a reckless driver and interfering with traffic safety laws.

Do people driving need to use their phone even if they think it's an emergency? People need to realize that if it is an absolute emergency and they need to answer it then pull over to the side of the road. Most people fail to realize that most phone and car accidents is because someone couldn't just put their phone down for more than five seconds to focus on whether or not the light is green or red. In my opinion and for recent studies that showed it I disagree with using your phone while driving and I feel as if it is a well-deserved law that people should not be on their phone while driving.

It doesn't matter if you're talking on the phone or texting while driving, it can distract you from paying attention to the road. None of that doesn't matter at that moment, because you could end up losing your life.

There are many dangerous effects of texting on the phone or talking on the phone while you're driving. Well, one danger while texting and driving is people can become distracted and can cause an accident. Another danger while you are driving and texting or talking on the phone is you can hit a pedestrian. Our brains are incapable of giving our attention to more than one activity at a time. So, this means when you are driving and talking on the phone, you're actually splitting your attention between at least two activities. That's why laws were made to prohibit texting and talking while driving.

If you break the law, there are consequences for texting on the phone or talking on the phone while you're driving. The consequences of texting on the phone or talking on the phone while you're driving is that you can get a monetary fine, which can be up to $500, depending on what state you're in.

Blocking incoming texts or calls is another way to prevent you from texting and talking while you're driving. If you just have to talk, pull over and stop if it's very important, if it's not important, just keep your phone out of sight.

Texting while driving is a big issue. People do it everyday, but they don't realize that their lives are in danger and so are others on the road. There are a lot of people dying each and every day, because of phone usage car accidents. Leave the phone alone while you are driving, because a text is not worth a life. That text will be there when you get to your destination. Don't choose to pick up the phone while you're on the road. It's very dangerous, even if it's just talking on the phone for one second.

So therefore, be very cautious of what you do with your phone while you're on the road!                                                               ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

The average person uses their phone many times a day whether it be consciously or not, we as a people always have access to our own devices. The problem with people using their phone is when to use it and how to use it properly. When inside of a vehicle there should only be a bare minimum of use to your phone. Whether that reason would be an emergency call or even doing simple things like using the maps application. All in all, humans as a whole should be able to use their phones but only to an extent.

The use of a phone in a car could be proven to be fatal but there are good reasons to use said phone, only in certain situations. One of the reasons would be that to use your phone to get your way through areas you have no idea how to get through or using your phone to find your way home from a place you have no knowledge on. The downside is that when the person glances at the phone to see where to turn or make a specific move they lose the focus on the road for a split second which could be fatal. Sometimes the use of a phone all depends on what kind of person it is.

The person themselves also plays a big role in the use of cellphones in the car. The person could be a maniac when it comes down to how they use their phone, some people can't even live without it because they are so connected to it, for those specific people who have those kinds of issues when it comes down using their phones they should not be able to use their phone at all because they would then get distracted by the other uses. The amount of sheer will they would need to not get distracted by those other things would be entirely on them but in the mean time they should have no reason to use their phone.

Phones play a big role in people's lives and it even saves them sometimes but the use of a phone is dangerous when the person is distracted on their phone.

Texting while driving, also called texting and driving, is the act of composing, sending, reading text messages, email, or making similar use of the web on a mobile phone while operating a motor vehicle. Texting while driving is considered extremely dangerous by many people, including authorities, and in some places have either been outlawed or restricted. As a form of distracted driving, texting while driving significantly increases the chances that a driver will be involved in a motor vehicle accident.

Research by the NHTSA suggested that an estimated 660,000 drivers use their phones during daytime driving. According to a report issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation, drivers between the ages of 20 to 29 are the most likely to text while driving. The International Telecommunication Union states that ""texting, making calls, and other interaction with in-vehicle information and communication systems while driving is a serious source of driver distraction and increases the risk of traffic accidents""

The scientific literature on the dangers of driving while sending a text message from a mobile phone, or driving while texting, is limited but growing. A systematic review study at the Queensland University of Technology Centre for Accident Research and Road

Safety-Queensland CARRS-Q found that visual-manual interactions such as texting and browsing have a detrimental effect on a number of safety-critical driving measures. Specifically, negative effects were seen in detecting and responding correctly to road signs, detecting hazards, time spent with eyes off the road, and lateral position. Mean speed, speed variability, lateral position when receiving text messages, and following distance showed no difference. A separate, yet unreleased simulation study at the University of Utah found a sixfold increase in distraction-related crashes when texting.

The low number of scientific studies may be indicative of a general assumption that if talking on a mobile phone increases risk, then texting also increases risk, and probably more so. 89% of U.S. adults think that text messaging while driving is ""distracting, dangerous and should be outlawed"". The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety has released polling data that show that 87% of people consider texting and emailing while driving a ""very serious"" safety threat, almost equivalent to the 90% of those polled who consider drunk driving a threat.

Despite the acknowledgement of the dangers of texting behind the wheel, about half of drivers 16 to 24 say they have texted while driving, compared with 22 percent of drivers 35 to 44. A survey of more than 90 teens from more than 26 high schools throughout the United States conducted by Liberty Mutual Insurance Group in 2006 showed that 46% of students consider texting to be either ""very"" or ""extremely"" distracting. An American Automobile Association study showed that 34% of teens admitted to being distracted behind the wheel because of texting and 40% of American teens say they have been in a car when the driver used a cell phone in a way that put people in danger.

Have you ever looked beside you and seen someone texting and driving? It is actually a law to text, call, or just be on your phone in some places. It is very dangerous it can cause a wreck, running red lights, or running someone over. I think you shouldn't be on your phone while your driving or even at a red light, if it's a phone call than maybe. Nearly 1.6 million wrecks happen from cell phone use while driving and 390,000 are injured or killed from that.

Some states made a law about this because it is very dangerous. 47 states have the hands free law. If you get caught the punishment is a fine that cost as little as 20 dollars all the way to 500 dollars. Another punishment is getting charges and your licenses changed to Class B. Not all states have made this a law yet because they don't see the concern.

Most people don't see the dangers but peoples lives get taken from this and drunk driving. People run red lights, run over people, or get in bad wrecks because of this. A couple examples of this is if a kid is getting off the bus and your texting and driving you could run over them or someone is walking across the road and you are texting and driving and run a red light and hit them. Also if your speeding and hit the tail end of someone while your on your phone while driving.

In my opinion you shouldn't text and drive. One it is a law and you should follow laws. Two it is very, very dangerous for yourself and others. If it is so important to risk other lives pull over or go into a parking lot. If anything call them, do not text them and when you call pair it to your car or truck.

Instead of risking your life and others just stay off your phone until you get where your going. No one should have to worry about their self or their loved ones because of someone that's texting and driving.

Cell phones haven't been around a long time but they have become a very big part of our daily lives. Phones have went from something you use to just call people, too your very personal computer, up to date will all the new software to make surfing the internet easier. Now, that sounds wonderful but these thing can also so be a huge distraction to many. Especially when they are being used while operating a motor vehicle.

For one thing, using your cell phone causes many distractions for your eyes, your mind, and your actions. It is easily possible for your eyes tom slip off the road. The Tampa Bay Times claim that it ""takes seconds to get your eyes off the road and into a car accident"". Therefore, instead of your eyes being locked into your phone, they should be focusing in on your speed, the road, and the traffic. At the same time, your mind can only process so much. According to Goldsborough ""the human mind is not capable of texting and driving"". Other people have also confirmed that "" driving is a one mind chore"" meaning that the mind cannot to both at the same time. In addition, your mind need to focus on one thing while driving and that is the road. Thus, concentration is important while driving and breaking that concentration causes a risk for an accident.

Secondly, texting while driving not only endangers yourself but other people on the road as well. Texting while driving can limit your response time to something like a car pulling out in front of you, a child or adult walking in front of you, and other things. Texting someone means that you have to put all of your attention into what you are texting which, so if you are driving and texting at the same time you are bound to miss something that you should have been paying attention too or you can hit something that you should have been paying attention too, like a car, animal or even worse a person. A article called ""Texting While Driving"" states that texting and driving has become a ""prominent social issue, and it's the most hazardous practice that risks accidents to drivers, cyclists and pedestrians"". A pedestrian can walk onto the road at anytime but it is up to the driver to pay attention to road and avoid endangering his/her and the pedestrian life.

Finally, the numbers speak for themselves, too many accidents have occurred as a result of people texting and driving. People's lives will always be endangered if people feel like the best time to call their mom or girlfriend is when they are driving. If we can just wait until we arrive at our destination before having to pick up the phone while driving then we can avoid a lot more accidents and more lives will be spared.

Most humans own and operate cell phones every day of their lives, for some people it's part of their daily routine. Using a phone while operating a vehicle comes with great dangers. Some argue that in some cases, people need to check their phone or be on it while on the road, for directions or informing whoever where they are.

To begin with, driving while using a phone can cause the driver to swerve in and out of lanes. This brings a greater risk of getting in an accident with other drivers around them, that might also be on their phones not paying attention. Additionally, when a driver is looking at their phone that means they are not looking at their speedometer or the speed limit on the road they're driving on. The faster a person is going the more damage that is done to the vehicle, if you went into a ditch, off-road etc. Not only just their car in some circumstances but also the other persons car if they hit someone else. In some states, its fully illegal to be on a phone while driving. Which means they would be pulled over and given a ticket for speeding and being on their phone.

Additionally, in the other hand some could argue that people should be able to use their phones while driving. Due to phones being used for navigation or for getting in contact with someone while they are driving. There has been plenty of devices invented that hold your phone for you, to make it easier to use GPS, maps, etc. Some messages people receive are too important to not be on their phone, or to not at least check their phone. There really isn't a valid argument to why people should be able to use their phone on the road, because in every scenario its dangerous to them, and the others on the round around them.

In conclusion, using a phone while driving is never going to be on the safe side of things. The risk of causing an accident is too high, due to other people around not paying attention to the road and the person on their phone not paying attention to others on the road. There's no valid argument to say that it is safe to do so, because every opinion thrown out there has a bad side to it. At the end of the day, just don't text and drive or use your phone while driving.

I believe that car drivers should be able to use their phone while driving but not over a certain speed limit so that if they get distracted they are not going that fast therefor there is a less chance of being seriously hurt. This new law could help a lot of people and even save lives.

Imagine that you're driving down the road at 30 miles an hour your mom is calling you but according to the new law you can't even touch your phone while in the car. I find this very absurd given that the chance of one dying at this speed is very low. Now imagine going 70 miles an hour and your mom calls you of course you should not pick it up because the chance of dying at this speed is way higher.

I believe that it should be left up to the people if they want to kill themselves by being distracted. Then let them kill themselves. At one given time there are 660,000 people on their phones while driving and 1 out of 4 accidents are caused by using a phone when driving. The best route is to inform people of the dangers instead of just incriminating it.

In the state of Georgia, it is illegal to even touch a phone while driving the only way to be able to talk is a hands-free device. This a very smart choice on the safety side of issues but on the personal side it can mess a lot of people up because they need to be able to access their phone. That's why they should not incriminate it but there should be open statistics and info about crashes and fatalities due to these crashes.

In conclusion I believe people should just make better choices because you never know it could just save your life. The best choice right now though is to invest in a hands-free device, so you won't be distracted, and police can't give you a ticket for talking on the phone. in other words don't touch your phone unless its super important because nothing is more important than your life.

19FE6C3E37A6,"In today's society, people all over the world are practically glued to their phones. Compared to when cell phones first came out, technology has evolved into an important item that we carry. You can do everything from buying music, paying bills, buying gifts, even completing homework on a cell phone. Even though cell phones has become one of the most useful tools that we use, sometimes we need to know when to put it away. I believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it can lead to horrific accidents, the consequences could be expensive, and in the long term it effects everyone.

Cell phone usage is the number one cause of auto death and/or injury. ""Each day in the United States, approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver."" (National Center for Statistics and Analysis) 1 Even if you are not on your phone while driving, someone else could be and you could easily become a statistic. Teen drivers are more than likely to get into car accidents because of the constant use of the phone. We can bring the number of deaths down but putting our phone away.

In the state of Georgia, it is illegal to use your phone while driving. If you are caught on your phone while driving, you will receive a ticket. These tickets can cost between $50-$2,750 depending on the number of offenses and type or driver. According to drivinglaws. org, ""Depending on the circumstances, a texting or cellphone violation could also lead to a reckless driving conviction. And if one of these violations results in the death of another person, vehicular homicide charges are a possibility."" Although there are some expectations to using your phone such as reporting traffic accidents, medical emergencies, fires, criminal activity, or serious road hazards, it is safe to use your phone only for emergencies and nothing else.

I can honestly say that everyone that I know has been effected by a car accident. Although I never been in one, my sister has been in an awful car accident and it has affected her mentally and physically. She has scars on her head which affects her self-esteem, she gets nervous while driving sometimes, and at the time of the accident, she needed help eating and getting dressed which caused the whole family stress. Just imagine if you caused someone to die just because you had to send a text message. How would you live with that? Car accidents can cause PTSD, adjustment disorder, depression, driving phobia, neurological damage, and substance abuse. This can affect not only the person who was injured in the accident, but it can affect the driver who caused the accident.

It is never that serious to put your life or anyone else's life in dangers because of a text, call, or social media. It is not worth the money and stress to be on your phone and drive. There are stands made for your phone that you can use in the car that way your hands can be on the steering wheel at all times. There are also bluetooth headphones you can use so your hands can be on the steering wheel as well. In my opinion, the best option is to put the phone in the glow compartment, purse, arm rest, or wherever in the car you cannot reach. There are no positive outcomes from using your cell phone while driving, it can only lead to disasters.

Lots of people always argue about being able to have their phones while driving, but that shouldn't be debatable. Not only do you put your life in risk, but you put other peoples life in risk. So many car accidents are caused because of texting and driving, most these accidents involved by teens. You should not be using your phone while you drive. Doing that puts everyone around you in danger. So is one text really worth it, is it worth putting your life in danger and others. It is extremely dangerous, because once you are on your phone you can't take your eyes off your phone.

Everyday in the United States Of America around one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers, and those drivers are distracted by their phone, causing them to lose control of the vehicle, putting people at risk of losing their lives. Texting and driving has been the biggest districation in the world. Every year, 21% of fatal car crashes involving teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19 were the result of using their cell phone while behind the wheel. This will increase 4% every year, and will be the resulting in more car accidents. No only do teenagers text and drive, but one fifth of an adult in the united states has been texting in driving.

Some people believe just because they are good drivers and it's just one text, nothing bad can happen but that is completely wrong. One text can change your entire life. It does not matter if you are a great driver like you may think, no one is a good driver. If another person who is being distracted by using their phone, they are not being a careful driver, in a flash of your eyes, you are putting your own life in danger because of the actions you are choosing to follow, which also puts the people around you in danger.

Some people argue that if they take their eyes off the road to look at their phone. No harm is being done to anyone, but so many things can happen in that one second for example a car can break and by the time the driver looks up it might be too late. There has been so many terrible car accidents, have killed kids, a mother, a father, a love one, and sometimes an entire family. When you get into a car accident and the cause of the accident was because you were distracted by your phone and you end up killing someone or causing them to go to the hospital the driver can end up in jail, because you shouldn't be on your phone when you are driving, If something is important and you need to be on your phone, you should pull over or park somewhere and then continue to drive, but you should never text in drive to put people's life in danger.

In conclusion, driving while texting should not be debatable because it is the most dangerous thing in the U.S. and its increasing and increasing every year and every day. That being teens of age 16 get in the most car accidents. There should be a law to prevent this, no one should lose a loved one because of a car accident involving the driver being distracted, because there could've been so many things done to prevent that. Losing control of a vehicle is so easy and dangerous when you get distracted by your phone. All accidents involving a driver being on their phone is totally preventable when you just leave it alone.   ",6,Phones and driving,Independent,1.0

I feel like drivers should not be able to use cellular devices in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I strongly feel this way because it's very dangerous. Texting and driving has been the main cause for most car accidents. Car accidents that can potentially lead to death or a serious injury. Not only are people putting their life at risk, but they're putting others life at risk as well. Texting can wait and should never be done while driving.

Operating a cellular device while driving a vehicle is dangerous in many ways. When your vehicle is traveling at 35 mph that means you are moving at 16 meters per second. So, in those few moments your eyes were on your cellular device instead of the road. This means you have moved far enough to not see a school bus, a kid playing, or a vehicle braking in front of you. Just reaching for your phone could be deadly as well.

Texting and driving has caused 1.6 million crashes a year. 390,000 injuries also occur each year due to texting and driving. Also 1 out every 4 car crashes occur due to texting and driving. Responding to a text while driving can distract a driver for around 5 seconds. At 50 mph this is enough time to travel the distance of a football field.

Honestly, I've seen so many people texting while driving while I was a passenger.

I didn't feel safe at all. It's almost like feeling like I'm in the car with a drunk driver. Seeing people drive reckless makes me wonder what's going to happen. I think that driving while texting should be banned completely.

So basically, cellular devices and cars are like oil and water. They don't mix well at all. If you take cellular device use while in cars out of the picture, this will benefit the world in many ways. There will be less car crashes, injuries, and deaths caused by distractions. Its simple cellular devices should not be used while operating a vehicle for any reason unless there is a life or death emergency. Taking them away from those operating cars or even bikes could save lives.             ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Most people don't know once you pick up your cell phone while driving is putting your life in danger also anyone else life whos around you. The use of cell phones should be prohibited while driving a vehicle.

Once you are driving you should be focus on the road and be aware of your surroundings. Being on your cell phone while driving can cause you to hit somebody in front of you because you not paying attention. When not using your cell phone while driving can decrease the number of deaths that happen every year. Statics show that most deadly car accidents comes from your phone in your hand while operating your vehicle.

Others may believe that they can do two things at one time, which is using their phones while driving. Most cases driver's blame using their cell phones for emergency purposes only. Business people have to keep their devices in their hand at all times due to job. It is important to most people that using their social media accounts, such as snapchat , while driving makes them popular.

In conclusion, you should not use your cell phone while driving most cars are updated like a cell phone. In case of an emergency Onstar will contact help as soon as possible. Therefore cell phones are very useless while driving because it can lead to causing someone's life in a blink of an eye. So using your cell phone should be against the law to protect everyone's safety.    ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
2C44C3912AC9,"Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometime we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones like driving while being on it. As a society we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety and health as well as others because we can't put our cell phones down.

Most people are guilty of using cell phones while driving. Although have we ever thought about it's danger? Five states plus Washington D.C. have hand-held bans and many states have bans for specific drivers. 60 percent of teens admitted to risky driving. Nearly half of those drivers admitted to text messaging while driving.

In April, 2009 in Houston Texas five children lost their lives when the car they were in lost control and slid into a rain swollen ditch. The driver lost control of the vehicle when he went to answer his ringing cell phone. The car went into the ditch and swept 100 feet down the raging current. The rescue team were unable to reach the car with the trapped passenger. Two adults and one ten year old girl were able to escape, but five children under the age of seven all passed away. You start to think to yourself is a cell phone worth all the dangers?

Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban cell phones while driving, is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. If you can try being careful because the money you put towards careless accidents that can be prevented can be put to the light bill etc. The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. In recent studies companies are paying close attention to the link between cell phone use and car accident and many auto insurance websites warn of the distracted driving driving.

Insurance companies are just waiting for you to mess up so they can increase your insurance. Don't fall for it, your cell phone can wait till your out of the vehicle or when your parked. Especially with the new hands-free law in Georgia with some real expensive tickets so my best advice is to stay off your phone in the vehicle. The consequences are not worth it so just put the phone died.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Since the beginning of modern technology there has always been a debate on the subject of using electronic devices while conducting a vehicle. There are many opinions on this subject, some more elaborate than others. Should people be allowed to use their phones while driving and possibly putting people's lives in danger? Although we can argue that there are many beneficial ways that you can use your phone in the comfort of your vehicle, the debate on whether it should be used at all is the main problem.

The National Safety Council reports that the usage of electronic devices while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year (prg 4). 1 out of 4 accidents are caused by texting and driving (prg. 4). These statistics prove that a couple of seconds from a minor distraction can literally be the difference between life and death or major injury. Full attention is needed while driving and nothing should obscure that for the safety of yourself and others.

It is a given that your attention should solely be on the road ahead of you but sometimes you need directions to certain places and that dilemma can be solved quite easily with the use of modern technology. In today's society phones and GPS devices have built in voice command programs such as ""Siri"" or ""Google Now"" and even ""Waze"" that specifically helps you navigate your music while driving. These innovations were created to help decrease accidents and further simplify your phone use and make it more accessible at any time.

Even though these programs exist on people's cellular devices accidents still occur because of careless driving. So it is safe to say that phones can be used while driving but with immense precaution. If drivers are careful they can safely conduct a vehicle while using technology but must continue to keep most if not all their attention on the road. Safety of others is very important as wee as personal safety and that should not be more important than anything during your time on the road.

There are many accidents caused by people texting and driving according to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging, so in that being said it is really dangerous for people to be using their cellphone while driving because you cant see where you are going and you are being entertained on your phone than looking for what is actually happening in the road. For example if you are driving while texting and the light turns red and you don't see that because you are texting then there is a high chance that you are going to be involved in an accident. It is extremely dangerous to text while driving because it could mean jail time or you could possibly hurt someone.

In the world today most people own a cellphone. Some can even say that it is weird not to have a phone. Society loves to advertise the newest phones year after year to keep people buying new ones, but some people use their phones so much that it actually becomes a hazard to them. Most people can say that they have used a cellphone while driving at least once but doing so also comes with many risks and consequences. It is bad to use a cellphone while driving because it can endanger one's personal safety, the passengers and pedestrians safety around them, and a person can have legal action taken against them.

Using a cellphone while driving can harm a person's personal safety no matter how far they are going. People cannot 100% pay full attention to the road and full attention to their phone, statistics can prove that. In the article ""Cell Phone Use While Driving Statistics"" by Teen Drivers Source, it states that ""Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37%. This quote proves that people cannot evenly multi task while driving. Even if people think that they can do it, it is scientifically proven that it is not possible.

Not only does using a cellphone while driving endanger a persons own health, but they also put passengers and pedestrians health endanger as well. In the article ""Texting and Driving Accidents Statistics"" by Edgar Snyder and Associates, it says ""Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving."" This means that thousands of people are injured each year by irresponsible drivers. Also in the article ""Texting while Driving"" by Matt Robertson, he states that ""Many people have died as a result of other people texting while driving."" Being a responsible driver does not only affect one person, but it affects and endangers everyone around them.

In some states the use of a cellphone while driving has been outlawed or banned but some people still continue to ignore the rules of the road and be an irresponsible driver. In the article ""The Consequences of Texting While Driving"" by Joshua, it says ""If a driver is found breaking their state laws on texting and driving, their punishment could range from minimal to serious."" The consequences for texting while driving are really not worth the trouble of that one text back.

Using a cellphone and driving in today's society is becoming a serious issue.

Some people don't understand how bad things can get just from one text or call back. If people cannot change the way they do things now, then later on in the future, society could become a bad or more dangerous place than it already is.

They are life savers for many, but can it also cause tragedy? In many scenarios, these devices can put one in danger, especially while driving. Some may think otherwise but in capacity, cell phones should not be used while operating a vehicle.

See cell phones, in most cases, are distractions from reality. Many aren't focused nor are they aware of their surroundings. Being in that state of distraction can cause minor slip ups such as simple as tripping over a rock. Now imagine one being behind the wheel with this distraction. In this scenario, a person is in control of a fast-moving vehicle. Being distracted while operating a machinery that can put you and others at risk is nowhere near safe nor okay. People increase their chances in crashing even for just looking at a notification for a second. If someone is in a situation of being distracted because of their cell phone, there's a high risk of drifting off the road, hitting another car, or even an innocent pedestrian. It also puts their own life in danger as well as the fellow passengers.

Being distracted with a cellphone while operating a vehicle is comparable as being under the influence.

While being under the influence of any sort or alcohol or drug, people tend to not be aware that they are in a position where they can injure or even worse put innocent people in danger as well as themselves.

Distracted driving and drunk driving both have similarities but they also differ in one major thing, the decision. The person that has the choice of checking their phone also has the choice to not. They decide to either put their life in danger or make the smart, right decision to focus on the road. That small action of not checking your phone, whether or not you know it, saves you and as well as other pedestrians lives. The choice is up to them.

Many people think of it as futile information when being told that using a phone on the road can lead to fatal deaths or major accidents. These warnings should not be taken as a joke. Even if you confidently ponder that you can multi-task and that you'll be fine or it won't happen to you, the possibilities are endless. About 9 people die everyday due to having or being a distracted driver. Over 1,000 injuries are due to this.

Today, there are families grieving over loved ones that were lost due to these incidents. It just takes the person behind the wheel to realize that lives are put into their hands. So leave the phone alone and remember, better left unread than dead.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

No matter what were on our phones, but should we be on our phones while we are driving. Most people would say no to this because it distracts you from the road and it puts everyone it the car at risk of an accident. 80 percent of people who have crashed was on their phone calling someone or just texting or watching a video. They get to distracted with YouTube, snapchat, Instagram, twitter and reedit. Maybe they were on them for a second and was looking away from the road then someone pull out in front of them and they couldn't react quick enough. They just hit him now their child in the back is now seriously hurt or the people in the other car are hurt too. People still think it's a good idea to let people drive with their phones. Imagine your child in the car first time driving and someone not paying attention because they were looking at their phone come out and hits your son. You wouldn't be happy and u would not like to lose your son/daughter with a dummy that was staring into his phone. it's not safe for people and it can cause some serious harm. I'm not saying u can't check your phone but do it at stoplight or use it when u need your GPS. Do not look at it 24/7 while u are driving it deteriorates your reaction time and make you end up in a hospital.    ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

People can't continue to allow phones while driving. More laws should be enforced about having phones in your possession while operating a motor vehicle. It is very dangerous and can lead to fatal situations. However, others think it's not necessary to have laws that take away time on the phone while driving.

Throughout the last couple years, having phones while driving have been a big factor in car accidents. There have been laws that have been put out to try and keep people from using them while driving but people do not like to listen. This causes car crashes and human death.

Car crashes are the main causes of teen death alone. Most of them are from using phones while driving. Over 1.6 million crashes happen each year due to phone use. Nearly 390,000 injuries.

So from now on we have to limit or even take away because people's lives are at risk with these phones. Teens deaths are going to continue to rise. Death tolls will spike if we let this happen. Laws will have to enforce it more aggressively.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
9B21F354EAE6,"Should people be allowed to use their cell phone while driving a vehicle? The answer to that question is a very complex one. You would have to be very specific when it comes to this because you have texting while driving, calling someone/ answering a phone call while driving, and lastly using social media while driving. Using your phone while driving is definitely a risk, but it also depends on what you are doing on that cell phone.

Texting while driving is by far the most dangerous this to do while driving a vehicle. When you are texting you take your eyes off the road many times. In the time you look at your phone to text someone back, you leave an opening for potential car accidents. For instance, let's say you get a text from an old friend and you decide to text back. In the time you are texting back you run a red light and someone crashing into you. You most definitely prevented that if only you weren't texting. While you are driving you don't need any distractions, its just you and the road. I know that people are not stupid and wont take their eyes off the road for a very long time, but lets just say that you arent looking and the other person in the other car was distracting too, there is a more likely chance for a car accident in that scenario.

Calling someone or receiving a call from someone while driving is not as dangerous as texting while driving. The reason for this is because, when you are having a conversation on the phone you don't have to be looking at the phone in order to talk. You could place the phone on your lap and just talk. You still have your eyes on the road and talking on the phone. Yes, sometimes it can be dangerous. That's only if you let the conversation be more important than your road safety. Being on the phone while driving is still risky and yes, you could probably also get in an accident. The thing is, it's less likely than texting while driving. It is more safe to be on the line with someone else while driving than to text someone because texting you are constantly looking down. Anything could happen, but you don't need to be looking at your phone in order to speak to them on the phone.

Being on social media while driving is a definite no, it is as bad as texting while driving. You are only distracting yourself while being on social media while driving. That is something you could do when you get to your destination or when you get home. Being on social media is not important enough to risk your life over. Why would you ever put liking a picture on instagram over the safety of your life. Texting and being on social media are more dangerous than anything else. You might think it's stupid like ""omg why would anyone ever be on social media while driving"" but trust me, a lot of people do it. Apparently checking someone's snapchat story is more important than your life.

In conclusion, i say that being on your phone while driving for the most part is not okay. The only thing i know for sure is that taking a phone call while driving isn't as bad as texting and driving. Be safe while driving and don't do anything stupid, keep your eyes on the road at all times. If you must answer a text at least wait until a red light so that it is less risky for you and others.

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving.

According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone puts drivers at a four time greater risk of a crash. Despite the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to always be available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that a hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. However, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to a tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to losing control over the car. ""Even though we as humans recognize that talking or texting on a cell phone or using social media apps while driving is unsafe, they often engage in these behaviors anyway""(Foss and Teft). So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents also say that a hands-free set is safe because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Research shows that using a headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. ""In 2017, distracted driving was reported in crashes that killed 3,166 people (8.6 percent of all facilities), although many instances may go unreported"" (Foss and Teft). It's also proven that people talking over the phone image of the person who they are talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrians step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time which may cause an accident because of lack of manoeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particular time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is an illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in a car. ""Texting while driving is the most dangerous activity on the road, even more dangerous than drinking and driving"" (""Injured in a Car Accident by Someone Using a Cell Phone""). People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable.""You cannot drive safely unless the task of driving has your full attention. Any non-driving activity you engage in is a potential distraction and increases your risk of crashing""(Andrew Currin). Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations .

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and other people's lives.

Should drivers be able to use cell phone while operating a vehicle? No, no driver should be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. The usage of cell phone while driving has been a big issue over the years. Driving is a big responsibility.

Over the years, the number of death have increased because of all the unnecessary car accidents caused by those who are driving and being on the phone. There have been many accidents some injured and some killed. People should understand that driving is a big responsibility. While operating a vehicle you need to think about those around you. Let's say, you are operating a vehicle and you on your phone texting and you get into a car accident. Now they have to call your close ones and tell them the tragdey news. You will put your loved ones in a worried situation. Do you really want that? Honestly there should be no a reason for that to happen. Reason one you should not operate a vehicle and be on your phone.

Also, you can prevent from getting tickets or from getting your license suspended. Getting a ticket for operating a vehicle and usage of cell phone is a waste of money, a phone call, message and social media can wait. Therefore, you do not want your license to be taking away. Having a license is very import, it's the main thing you need to drive, so if they take it away you will not be able to operate a vehicle. You must know your opportunities that you have, take advantage while you can. Do not make the simple mistake to get it taken away just because you are being on your phone and being caught over and over. Those are your rights that you have, and van be taken away.

After all, operating a vehicle and usage of cell phone, have its consequences. Think about all the bad things that could happen when using a cell phone while driving. So, you can act and understand that driving is a big responsibility. Avoid getting into an accident or tickets. You have rights and they can be taken away in a matter of a second. After everything it is very dangerous to operate a vehicle while being on the phone, make the right decision, think about yourself and those around you.

3FCC179594CD,"Driving can be extremely dangerous for you or anyone else, especially if you're not careful and focused. While driving you must be sure that your taking every precaution you can to maintain safety for yourself and others as well. Many people believe that the use of cell phones can be very hazardous, and I strongly agree with that statement for many reasons. Cell phones have caused fatal wrecks that lead to either death or serious injury. For example, ""an article published by Tony Long states that he was almost killed on his motorcycle while trying to avoid being hit by a reckless driver who was on the phone."" The use of cell phones while operating a vehicle isn't the most ideal or realistic to ensure your safety as well as others safety.

Cell phones cause late reactions, especially for those that are being held in the driver's hand. Majority of people have a habit of allowing their cell phone to influence their reflexes and reactions to certain death-defying situations. One of my resources states, ""Not only are 27 percent of all automobile accidents believed to result from talking or texting while driving, but smartphone use has also been implicated in several recent rail disasters as well."" The use of cell phones while driving a vehicle is just as dangerous as drunk driving, maybe even worse because studies shown that, ""texting and driving slows the reaction time more than being drunk"". Meaning that using a phone while under the wheel can alter a driver's reaction time on the road because your focusing on two things at once, although all your attention should be towards driving and driving only.

Even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example- increases your risk of crashing. The National Safety Council reports that, ""answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field."" Anything can happen while you're driving, such as: a car could hit their brakes in front of you, a car could be merging into your lane, traffic might be coming up, or something might jump out into the road. Therefore, you need to keep your eyes on the road at all times with your hands free of anything other than the steering wheel.

It is statistically proven that the cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes with nearly 390,000 injuries each year. Even with those high numbers, people still choose to be on a cell phone while managing with a vehicle on the road. Some people believe that it is safe to use a phone while driving, or that ""nothing will happen to them"". In 2017, there were 34,247 distracted driving accidents and 15,341 that were aged between 15 and 29 were involved in fatal crashes while driving with a cell phone in hand. Therefore, some people may believe that using a cell phone while driving isn't dangerous, but the facts say otherwise.

In conclusion, don't operate a vehicle while using a phone at the same time because it can lead to some serious consequences. You are not only endangering yourself but your endangering others on the road, as well as passengers, or even any close-by pedestrians. Driving needs complete attention and focus so ensure the risk of any injuries or deaths because driving is very dangerous. Using a cell phone takes away your focus and attention from driving because now you're trying to multi-task which means you're playing with life or lives. Speaking from experience, cell phones should be banned while driving because they slow your reaction time to anything that may be happening around you. Managing a cell phone while driving is now putting you in a life or death situation that you wouldn't want to be put in.            ",6,Phones and driving,Independent,1.0

The use of cellphones during driving can be catastrophic not many people have the skills to watch the road and their phone at the same time. The fact of the matter is that it's too dangerous to let people use cell phones while they drive, the accidental crashes that happen each year would skyrocket. I advocate for a ban of drivers using cellphones while driving.

""Approximately 660,000 drivers try and use cellphones behind the wheel of an automobile"" according to edgarsnyder. com. This is extremely risky as not being focused while driving can lead to death by car crash, not just for the driver at fault but everyone in the crash. The drivers of America need to be attentive when operating a vehicle because of: pedestrians, stop signs, public and or private property, cars, trucks, etc. The mortality rate of people in car crashes are very high, and the property damages done are very extreme, not to mention that it can cause problems later in life as well. Overall it's not even worth the trouble to use your cellular device while driving.

To look at the perspective through another person's shoes is the key to understanding why this is true. The thought of leaving this world or being the cause of someone else leaving this world is enough for me not to even think about using a cellphone while driving. The hearts of the family members who had their loved ones taken away makes me tear up. A great man once told me, ""all life is precious and it is not up to man but our creator to take it away.

However, is it good to use your phone at all times, there should be a time for when to use it and not to use it. That is why people should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it is a huge distraction, it could cause serious accidents, and it's not necessary while driving.

Although phones have become a huge deal in our life they are also a huge distraction from the world around us. When is the last time you took time to look up at the sky and the world around you, can't remember? That is because everyone is always looking down at their phones and some people don't even leave their house because these phones. So if you are on your phone and driving almost none of your attention will be on the road; you will be more worried about what is going on in your phone rather than what is in front of you. Some people even live off just their phone and need to check it frequently, so that could become a big problem if you are on the road and need to make an important text or call.

While on the road with a lot of cars being on your phone could cause a lot of accidents. You may not know it but looking down at your phone while driving could swerve your car out of your lane. This could cause major accidents and could harm you or the people around you. There has been plenty of accident where people were on their phone not paying attention and crashed because of it. Driving and phones just do not go together, it is the same as driving drunk because you do not have your full attention on the road. It is never safe to use your phone while driving especially because you do not need it.

Driving could be complicated for some people but your phone is not necessary while driving. You should already be concentrated on the road and the things going on around you. Driving requires you to pay attention the road and the signs on the road so you can know what is coming up or if a road is closed off. How will you know if you are to focused on your phone to notice anything around you. That is why your phone is not necessary while driving because it just bring distractions to you. This is why phones have a driving mode so you cannot receive messages while driving so you can be safe.

Overall it is important to know that people shouldn't use their phones while driving because it is a huge distraction from the road. You should also focus more on the road or you could cause huge accidents to many people. The thing you need while driving is you because phones are not necessary while driving they are just too much of a distraction already.              ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

""He said, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was texting.' I said, ""Son, do you know what you just did? He said, 'I'm sorry I'm sorry,'"" Kuchler quoted the pickup driver as saying."" (Lozano). On the 30th of March 2013, A 20-year-old truck driver was texting and driving, hitting a mini church bus in Texas. This resulted in the loss of thirteen innocent lives. Today, majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. And news stories like this cause a lot of controversy behind the usage of cellphones while operating a vehicle. Despite laws and bans placed on the use of cell phones while driving, each driver is accountable for their decisions on whether they wish to use their cell phone while driving.

Operating a vehicle while using your cellphone has proven to be fatal to both parties; the operator and his company. Just by texting and driving, you are six times more likely to be in a fatal accident than those who drive intoxicated. On August 27,2013, eighteen-year old, Kyle Best, caused on accident while he was texting his friends. The case stated, "" Plaintiffs Linda and David Kubert were grievously injured by an eighteen-year-old driver who was texting while driving and crossed the center-line of the road."", and also later stated

""Best's cell phone record showed that he and Colonna texted each other sixty-two times on the day of the accident, about an equal number of texts originating from each."" Grieving parents, children, and spouses say goodbye to a loved one because of someone or their loved one's mistake.

Although there has been a decrease of deaths of people texting and driving, people still use some type of electronic, such as a global positioning system (GPS), to navigate and take others around. Taxi drivers are the main people having to change routes multiple times a day. This can be dangerous because they are risking their lives just to make a living and they don't even realize it. Inexperienced cab drivers who are hired from phone applications such as Uber or Lyft, statistically have a higher chance of being in a car accident than those who work full time and have years of experience.

Around 2007, states started placing laws against texting while operating a vehicle. So, to the thousands of people who do it; It is illegal. Texting and driving is just as risky as driving under the influence, which means you are just as likely to get caught. In Georgia, all distracted driving charges are misdemeanors, which means they could be charged with just a monetary fine unlike others which can carry jail time. Distracted driving also gets you points on your license, and not the good kind of points. According to an online source, by getting distracted driving ticket can lead to insurance companies raising your rates. Each state and insurance company have different restrictions so it is unsure of how much they may raise it.

Despite laws and bans placed on the use of cell phones while driving, each driver is accountable for their decisions on whether they wish to use their cell phone while driving. Texting and driving affect the lives of thousands and millions of people are affected due to these actions causing fatalities and economics conflict. People need to take in consideration that they are not the only ones risking their lives while driving and texting. With that being said, no one should not be able to use their phones at any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Cell phones have become an addiction to the human race. We as humans tend to use them for everything in our lives. People use their cell phone for communication, social media, alarms, schedules planning, etc. Often times people are so distracted by their cellular device that people use them at the wrong time. One of those wrong times are when people use their phone while operating a vehicle. It is dangerous for people to use their phone while driving.

There are a lot of issues that can come with using your phone while driving. Others lives are put into danger, fatal car crashes, accidents and using your phone shows that you are willing to risk your own personal safety. According to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging (teendriversource. org). ""Statistics show that the use of a cell phone behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent (teendriversource. org).""

Distractions from cell phones cause death rates to go up. Society has a bad addiction of being on their cell phones for long periods of time. This addiction is causing people to be distracted while driving. Many people have been in car accidents where people were brutally injured and some have had fatal accidents. Not only did the distracted driver hurt the opposing driver but the loved ones of the opposing drive goes through a lot. Their loved one might be hurt and need full time care or they may have to plan a funeral.

Situations like these should make us think about the actions we take. Society should pull away from their phones to save others lives and save heartbreak from others. Most adults think it is the teenagers that are causing the problems with distraction of cell phones. Adults are a big problem when it comes to being distracted with cell phones while driving. However, society should not accuse each other but we should work together on making a change in cell phone usage.

In conclusion, society should take time out and stop being selfish about using their phones while driving. People should stop trying to check their messages, read the latest tweet, or catch up on the latest post on instagram. Society should think about the safety of themselves and the safety of others. Waiting until your next destination to check your phone could help bring down the death rates of fatal car accidents. Our states have laws in place that demand that we don't text while driving. People have bought devices to hold their cell phone on their car dash but that doesn't help. The driver tends to look a the phone instead of the road. They especially look at the phone when making a video call. The purpose of driving is to arrive at our next destination safely. Face to face conversation should be practiced more and that could decrease the use of cellphones while driving. Everyone should stay safe and keep the world safer by focusing on the road and not our cellular device.

AB24D1F2D15D,"According to the NHTSA ""In a split second, you could ruin your future, injure or kill others, and tear a hole in the heart of everyone you love."" This can happen with cell phone usage while driving. To be more specific, you have to look at your phone in order to text and you have to look at the road in order to drive. Which makes cell phones a distraction while driving. Therefore drivers should not be able to use phones while operating a vehicle because it can cause distracted driving which can lead to accidents and danger to pedestrians.

Driving while distracted can be anything that takes your attention off the road and on to something else. Texting while driving has now replaced drinking and driving as the leading cause of death among teenage drivers. According to a survey conducted by AT&T, 49 percent of American adult drivers admitted they text while driving. In that same survey, more than 90 percent of drivers know texting while driving is dangerous. Recently there was an accident in Tennessee caused by a bus driver who killed three victims because he decided to text and drive. Texting and driving is dangerous and deadly.

Anne McCartt, is a senior Vice president for the highway safety says in the article, ""No Phones, Safer Roads"", that ""Whether hand held or hands free, talking on the phone while driving increases your risk of having a crash."" This is true because driving with your head down or eyes on something else can cause you to possibly lose control of the wheel and increase your chances of having an accident. For example you cannot expect to walk around with your eyes closed and not hurt yourself. It is the same as with driving you cannot drive with no eyes on the road and not expect to crash and cause hurt to you and your passengers.

Although some people may think that using hand free devices is okay. However, going hands free does not actually prevent the driver from being distracted. Because they still have to put hands on in order to answer the phone or text. It can actually be just as distracting as hands on for the driver. .

Driving a car requires lots of focus. It is not something to try and multitask with. Majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Cell phones can be a major distraction while driving. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Trying to use a phone while driving can be very dangerous or even life threatening. Anyone can easily look down for a second and instantly be in a car wreck. No one ever understands what life changing things can happen in such a short period of time. Not only can the person using their phone while driving be severely injured, they could also injure someone else or even kill someone. For example, if a person is driving and they are on their phone. And they hit someone, resulting in killing them. That person will get charged with vehicular manslaughter. Where they can end in jail for up to six years or maybe even worse because they were on their phone. Then their life is ruined.

Another reason why people should not use their phones while driving is fines. It is not only dangerous to do so but can also be pretty expensive, fines can be up to a hundred and fifty dollars and tack on a point to their driving record. For most teenagers when they get up to 4 points on their record; their license will get suspended.

Also no one can actually focus on two things at once it is actually physically impossible.

If their brain is focused on their phone. Whether they talking on the phone, texting, or checking social media; their brain is paying attention to that and not the road in front of them.

Using a phone while driving is not safe and definitely not worth the consequences. Make smart choices and don't use your phone while driving. Your life may depend on it.                                                                           ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

The use of cell phones and other handheld devices make daily life in the 21st century easier and more convenient than it has ever been. However, attachment to these devices can distract individuals from their surroundings causing a number of problems. Mainly, using a cell phone while operating a vehicle has a great potential to cause accidents. Alternative hands free devices such as bluetooth headsets can keep a driver's eyes on the road while also being able to communicate as necessary.

If a driver is using their cell phone, it means that their visual focus has become divided and the potential for an accident is greatly increased. According to The United States Department of Transportation, cellphones are the cause of 1.6 million car crashes per year in the U.S. Driving a car requires a certain amount of focus, coordination, and reflexes in order to drive safely. Humans can only focus on so much at once, so unnecessary operation of a cellular device is highly advised against when doing something as potentially dangerous as driving.

Hands free accessories are the perfect alternative for people who absolutely need to be communicating while driving. Headsets and bluetooth screens integrated in to some cars are relatively safe compared to blatant texting while driving. While a study done by the University of Utah displays evidence that using these hands free devices can incapacitate a driver even more than alcohol, having a set of eyes on the road is still better than none at all.

When driving, the best way to avoid an accident is to not communicate via a cellular device in any way. Laws against using cell phones when driving should remain in place and continue to be enforced. Not only do they put the driver in danger, they put everyone else on the road in danger as well.    ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. I'll explain why I think drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Today in the year of 2020 people use their phones on a daily basis because at this point that has become the most important thing in any person's life, I mean I can't say anything I use my phone almost every day, but the one thing I don't do is get on the phone while driving.

Well first I want to say that I don't think that it is ok to drive while on the phone it's just not safe, because you could be driving and going to answer the phone at the same time and pull out in to the middle of the four way stop thinking it's your turn to go and get T-boned because you were too busy trying to answer a phone call.

The second reason I don't think you shouldn't be on your phone while driving is because you could be answering a text or watching a video or reading something and that make you distracted from what's around you on the road and it could put you and other people around you in danger, and could get you really hurt some people get hurt so bad they don't recover or they could lose their life.

The third and final reason is because it's the law that you can't be on the phone while on the road you could get pulled over and get a ticket and you could even get your license take from you driving while driving isn't worth your life so what do you want to do answer that text or end up in a body bag.

Cell phone use while driving statistics show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. According to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help families manage this dangerous risk.

Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Coupled with inexperience and lack of driving skills, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.

Because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced, parents need to make sure teens understand the value of engaged driving where the driver is continuously attentive and focused. Make a family commitment not to use distracting devices while driving.

Parents should also avoid calling their teen when he or she is driving. Instead ask to be called before leaving one place and when arriving at the next destination. A teen may feel compelled to answer a parent's call if received while driving.                         ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Should people use their phones while driving? Well 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. People are so distracted by their phones they forget about their own safety at risk while driving. While you're driving you should be more focused on the road and your surrounds more than a Facebook notification. It's not only teens that do this adults as well use their phones while driving. It is one of the leading reasons of car accidents today. Not only are you putting yourself at risk but you're putting others in risk as well. So should you use your phones while driving I think not.

Texting and driving is one of the most dangerous forms of distracted driving. In fact, the average text sent or read in a car takes a driver's eyes off the road for 5 seconds. This is more than enough time to get in a life-altering accident. Now in the matter of 5 seconds of looking at your phone you can cause yourself to getting in a really bad accident. Now if you get caught texting or using your phone while driving you can get in some trouble. Violation of the law is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of $25 for a first offense, $50 for a second offense, and $75 for a third offense. The penalty for a first offense for violating the texting law is a fine of $20 to $400 and up to four points on the driving record of the offender. So are you sure you willing to pay the fine or do the time for texting while driving. It really isn't worth it you can wait until you get to your destination. There more things important than your phone while you're driving like the road than an Instagram notification.

Using your phone while driving doesn't only put the driver at risk, but also everyone else on the road. Take for example the many young students who have died while driving because they were texting. Looking around while driving, you can see people distracted by their cell phones. These people are not only teenagers but also adults. The shocking truth is that texting while driving increases the chances of crashing by over 23 times normal driving. People have a longer response time when they text. Then the passengers may not be looking at the road because they may be on their phones. On average, an accident happens within two to three seconds when the driver is texting. So if you do get into an accident you could do major damages to another person car or worse you could cause severe health damage to the other person that was in the other vehicle. Using a cell phone while driving caused an estimated 1.5 million car accidents in the U.S. in 2018 according to the National Safety Council. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year including the other that got was in the accident because of the bad driver.

There are many reason on why texting while driving is very useful. Here's seven reasons to stop using your phone and driving it puts innocent lives at risk, it puts your life at risk, it is comparable to, if not worse than, driving under the influence ,you are more likely to crash, it's very easy to simply pull over, you are setting a bad example for children and it is often illegal. The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example- increases your risk of crashing. As long as their use does not distract you from focusing on the road and you do not have to touch the phone. Using your phone when your car is stationary at traffic lights or in congested traffic. Illegal. When the engine is running and you are in control of the car, it is illegal to touch your phone. Now if you were a passenger in a car would you want the driver to be using their phone while driving? No so think when you're driving and you have the urge to look at your phone think of what could happen if you take your eyes of the road or how you would feel if someone on their phone while driving. Please don't text while drive or get on your phone.

So now should people should you use your phone while driving? Think of what could happen while doing such a thing like checking your phone. It isn't worth it at all to look at that notification at all. You can save yourself from getting into an accident. You can save yourself from potentially killing someone for just looking away for 2 seconds. So please don't use your phone while driving please and thank you.

Although phones have a lot of impact in our lives phones are getting better and easier for us to

Use. By that I mean technology is getting better with the generation changing and its a lot easier

Because back in the day like in the 1900's there was flip phones coming out and it was a little

Difficult to use not by answering a call but by texting or trying to find something on the internet.

So with the phones getting better with the years or technology in general it gets to people trying

To multitask or simply trying to answer a text back, a call, or simply just try to look something

Up on the internet. Which comes to being really dangerous when driving and trying to do some

Of those things. Which honestly in my opinion you shouldn't really do that and should wait to

Answer the phone or whatever you are trying to find. Or simply just give your phone to someone

If you have someone with you on the passenger side. Because not waiting to use your phone can

Get you in trouble and you can also lose your live. By what I mean by that is that if you're

Driving and you decide to pick up your phone to just see your social media or a text message and

Your eyes are not on the road like they are supposed to be you can run someone over or simply

Just move on to the other lane next to you and you crash into another oncoming car or simple

Just crash to a pole of a store and if that happens you can lose your life or the other person can.

Image if the other person you crashed into has little kids and something bad happens to their kids

Do you know how much guilt you would have? Cause I would have so much guilt because it was

My fault the other family is suffering just because I wouldn't wait to see my phone. It doesn't

Accidents can be the result of anything from being drunk to being a little tired. Yes, even being too tired behind the wheel can cause an accident. While there are an infinite numbers of ways accidents can be caused, but there is one way that is currently growing in popularity. That way is cell phone use while driving. Cell phones are already known as a possible distraction in most situations, but they have a great impact on the focus of anyone, and if not taken seriously it could have unwanted results. This is a very likely result no matter if they're an experienced driver or someone who is just beginning. The most common ways such accidents happen is by drivers trying to text, make phone calls, or use other applications on their phone while on the road. However, this problem could be solved very easily if drivers today used their smartphones blue tooth ability when possible, and otherwise refrain from using their phones. Cellphones should not be being used while anyone is on the road and driving no matter what

The issue of irresponsible driving by using a cell phone is more common than news stories today make it out to be. In the past it was more thoroughly addressed when cellphones first came out and the issue was new, but now people expect it and have lost any urgency to stop people from using their phones. Many people now think its ok. This is one of the worst things that could happen because the recurrence of these accidents is only grown from then. There are statistics that compare the accident cause rates from then and now. In 2013, a total of 1.2 million crashes occurred, and 341,000 involved text messages. Then in the first six months of 2018 alone a total of 18,770 deaths were recorded from texting and driving accidents. This makes it very clear of how serious this issue can become. No matter how much safer cars get, people must be as alert and focused as they would have to be if they were in the most dangerous car because anything could happen.

Most sources, when tackling this issue add the detail that this is just or mainly teenagers that use their phones while driving. This is assumed because of how often teenagers are on their phones a day, but adults use their phones just as often. Of course, extra caution is needed when teenagers drive, but the exclusion of anyone who is not a teenager leaves the possibility of accidents from this to occur just as often. This allows any reckless adult to assume that they are skilled enough when it comes to using their phone while driving. Further research shows that this can and does happen to people of all ages and driving experience.

This way of thinking brings about greater risk for severe accidents. As well as the wrong influence on teens that are learning and planning to drive. If people don't take the initiative to make sure them and their loved ones are being safe on the road, then anything that the government does will have no effect.

Although they're not as effective as hoped, many stats in the United States have established laws that will fine anyone who is seen using their cell phone and driving. Texting and driving is very much illegal today, but there is still a lot of accidents that occur. Most importantly, laws like this have little to no effect on whether the person fined will try and or do it again in the future. The government is taking more precaution for our safety. So why has it proven to be so difficult to take responsibility of our own safety.

The simple fact is that texting and driving is problem that should not exist. There are so many ways such accidents could have been prevented. Such as a using Bluetooth device, having the passenger text for you, and of course, just flat out not using a phone while driving at all. In addition to just those few ways there is a growing number of preventatives as technology progresses. With that being said, the first step is taking self-responsibility, and it starts with each specific individual.            ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

As a society we have to become more focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Every day in the United States one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers and a lot are injured in some way in crashed, by these irresponsible, distracted drivers. Most of the dangerous distracting activities that many people do is texting while driving. It's extremely dangerous because people who are doing this is putting more attention in texting, she/he is thinking about other things besides concentrating on driving. Driving requires a lot of focus and full attention. Distracted driving affects all drivers from time to time but can come with stiff consequences. Unfocused or distracted driving does not affect all drivers the same. Any task that takes your attention away from the road is a distraction. These include crying or fighting kids in the back seat, talking on the phone, eating lunch, and much more. Unfortunately, it is common for people to multitask while driving.

However, any distraction (eating with one hand and driving with another, looking away to grab a fallen object, spilling a beverage, etc.) which causes you to not devote full attention to driving can cause accidents. Banning cellphone usage is a law that has come about because of the high level of distraction from the devices and the number of people using them. Some states ban all usage while others ban only texting. Most people think that nothing will ever happen to them until, one day, it does. It only takes a split second of distraction to create a lifetime of pain and suffering. Remember, driving is a privilege and your decisions do not only affect you but other people on the road too. Last year a mother of 4 lost all her kids in a car crash 3 died at the scene of the wreck and the other one died at the hospital the mother wasn't paying attention because she tried to answer a call from her friend and her phone felled out here hand and she was searching for it while her eye was off the road and when she finally found she couldn't stop in time and she crash into another car it's very important to keep your eyes on the road because it can cause a lot of damage or even worse.

Smartphones have become a huge part in everyday life ranging from making a simple call to playing online games. With this era it's rare not to see someone constantly checking their notification even in the most parcul ior area. Even with smartphones having this high tech specs making everyday life simple, many people fear that smartphones are taking over lifes and endangering the health of the people. A prime example is whether or not drivers should be using smartphones while operating a vehicle?

There are those who believe its common sense to not turn on a phone while driving and there are those who say phone make commutes easier for them. Should drivers not look through their phones while operating a vehicle.

Smart Devices has made the daily life of people's simple from making calculation to having video chat with friends or family. This is where many people spend their time looking at post and trying to get likes for their pictures. We even seen videos of other not looking were their going and bumping into poles or even getting hit by drivers. But getting distracted by just a simple whistle from a phone has created a blur line between on looking at that notification or keeping a stable mind. Walking while texting is a problem, but texting while driving has became a national issue where many states are trying to combat this issue, even average citizens are raising awareness to this problem. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or NHTSA has stated that texting while driving has risen over the past decade as more incidents are revealed that the driver were on his/her phone before the accident. Even with a decrease in accident by 2 percent in late 2017 the NHTSA has confirmed that 73% of accidents are due to distracted drivers. This caught the attention of States realising that the number of accidents are rising leading them to take measures to prevent more fatal accident. A prime example is Georgia as they became one of 16 states to ban phones while operating a vehicle. This comes as many news outlet and even will known news station reported of a fatal accident in Georgia where three college student lost their life in a fatal car accident. The reason this became a national news was what happen before the accident which lead to lives being lost. What happen was the result of a poor decision made by the driver who ultimately ended the life of three friends. What this drive did was selfish and irresponsible as the driver before the accident was going top speed of over 100 mph and on their phone.

Why they did this was a result of wanting to have a good Snap for the most popular app Snapchat so friends can watch. What comes after was tragic, leading to Georgia to place House Bill 673 or The Hands-Free Georgia Act that became effect in July 1, 2018. But why has distracted drivers risen over the past decade even if they know the consequences that comes with it.

Studies from universities revealed that looking at your phone has become an addiction for so many, it has ever beaten people who use illegal substance and smokers.

California State University tested on why people are addicted to smartphones by creating a little experiment. This experiment was sending countless messages to a volunteer, but the catch was to place the phone out of reach of the volunteer. What they found was a spike in the heart and the breathing pattern changing. They keep on changing by each notification that was being sent. In this case, the anxiety was caused by withdrawal from an addiction. Why do people get addicted will it's this substance called dopamine. Dopamine is a chemical within the brain that gives use this happy feeling when we hear that notification ringing in our pocket. This is why people are addicted to their phones because they don't realize that the ring of a phone activates the Dopamine. No matter how hard a person tries to not look through their phone the brain gives of this anxiety of not knowing what will happen if they don't look. Why do people value their phones more than others is a good question.

This is where it come to play when discussing whether or not drivers should be using their phones while driving. Even with states placing laws to prevent accidents from occurring, this hasn't stopped those few from looking through his/her phone will on the road. Will all been part of this looking through your phone waiting for that special someone to text back. But is it possible to stop drivers from checking their phone completely, will this is based on the moral of those who feel like that text is more important than human lifes. No matter how hard official warn about the dangers of texting, they ultimately fall into deaf ears or those who believe this will never happen to them. The only way phone driving accident will decreases is by having people recognize what they are doing, because even with laws put in place it fall into people hands in whether they will obey or fall into their selfish needs.

Operating a cell phone or any type of device while driving comes with many risks. Many don't see the consequences that it may bring and use it anyway. Studies have proven that most car accidents are due to use of a device while driving. Many may believe it's not that serious but in reality it is. Therefore, should operating a device while driving be banned?

To continue, using a mobile device while driving increases the risks of a car accident.

Stephen Corby has an article, ""Why you really shouldn't use your mobile phone while driving"" here, he compares the usage of a mobile device while driving to driving with your eyes closed or reading a book while driving. ""Frankly, using mobile phone while driving, is such a stupid cause of death that, before the advent of the cell phone it would only have been comparable with reading a book while driving or closed eyes while driving."" Corby makes a pretty great comparison here. The amount of time you take to pick up your device and see who is calling you or texting you is enough time to get off the lane. While driving you should have full attention on the road. Although it is tempting to use your device try considering a longer life for yourself or someone else on the road.

Furthermore, driving requires one's full attention. Most of the time accidents aren't caused by one but instead someone else on the road. One could be perfectly driving and paying full attention but then another one can come maybe drunk or using a phone and come crash into the other. In scenes like these is where maybe if you weren't on your device you could've seen the other coming. In many occasions this has been the cause of accidents. Using a mobile device behind the wheel just takes your attention off the road even if it may be for seconds. One should always have their full attention on the road. It's more likely to prevent accidents from happening if your full attention is on the road and not on what is happening in your phone.

Therefore, the usage of a mobile device while driving is prohibited now.

""HANDS FREE LAW"" is the law passed by our recent governor Nathan Deal. The law has been taking place since July of 2018. HFL prohibits a driver from occupying a phone behind the wheel. The driver must not have a phone in their hand or any part of their body to support their phone. A driver can not send messages nor read them. A drive can not watch a video or record a video while driving. There are exceptions into using a phone but those are only when reporting a crash, or another emergency. The law does not apply when the driver is parked. Breaking the law can cause one to have consequences such as a fine of $50 for the first time, $100 for the second, and

$150 for the third, each time points get taken away from your license which could reach the point where your license will be suspended.

In conclusion, being distracted while driving can cause fatal crashes or other consequences. There are a series of reasons why one might pick up a device behind the wheel and to think to themselves it could be an emergency but even that split second of attention into the device can become a lethal end based on one decision and curiosity. It's better to avoid and prevent something bad from happening than to continue to test it until it does. Usage of a mobile device while driving should not be allowed. And as stated in the 4th paragraph it is prohibited, it is a law. Let's set full attention on the road and be the smart drivers.

I have heard so many stories and lectures about being on your electronic devices while driving. Using electronic devices while driving your vehicle is not great at all. Cell phones are just a distraction that tends to keep your mind off the road and focused on the phone. Distractions while driving can lead to injuries and/or death. I remember when my father first bought me a cell phone; I could not keep my eyes or hands off of it. It became a total distraction for me. Three Main Reasons why drivers should not use cell phones while driving is because, such behavior can cause casualties, inflict pain upon families, and leave the driver with guilt.

First, causing and/or having casualties in families are not great. Having death causes pain, sorrow, and many burdens that people have on their shoulders to deal with. Hearing about another family member in your family being passed away, is not a good feeling. Almost 1.3 million people die due to being on their electronic devices while driving their vehicle. An electronic device is really not necessary while driving. In addition, using cell phones while driving is unsafe; therefore let's try to prevent many casualties as we can.

Another reason why citizen's use should not use cell phones while driving is because; the person driving the vehicle may inflict pain on their families. With that being said, the family members of the deceased family will be hurt, because death leaves a void. Likewise, the family member of the driver who caused the accident will be hurt as well, because they would not want their loved one incarcerated. Although nothing replaces a life; however, violators should be disciplined for their actions.

Finally, a person using cell phones while driving can end up having to live with guilt upon them. What can they do? What can do they say? The words ""I am sorry"", does not change a bad occurrence. It can be really difficult living with guilt. For example, I have a friend who killed a dog and after the incident happen she felt astonished by what she had done. Her family was hurt by what she had done to another family's pet, and the dog's family was upset because it was their guard dog and home protector. After all of the commotion was over, she had said she really felt bad about the situation. When you do something wrong, you cannot always apologize for your wrong doings. When you try to talk to their families, they will not always listen. The result for you is dealing with guilt for the rest of your life.

In conclusion, using cellular devices while driving has become more of a negative influence. More and more people having started using their phones while driving. Although these kinds of actions can cause casualties, influential pain, and having to live with guilt, the citizen willing to not use their cellular device while driving, can prevent all of this from having.

It can be considered one or all three types of distraction: Visual- which is removing eyes from the road, Manual- removing hands from the wheel, and Cognitive-removing your attention or focus from driving. Any of these can lead to catastrophic consequences to you or any passengers in the vehicle. This is why those with stands or hands-free are not a solution but a lie to see as if it's better. Most people don't drive with both hands once they are comfortable driving. Teens who have little experience and high cell phone use create double the danger.

While people with high experience may think they are exempt but they are still human. The average reaction time to visual stimulus is 0.25 sec. Drivers spend so much more than that looking at their phones by the time they realize what's happening it will be too late. To prevent this there are several alternatives one could do if it is necessary to use their phone. You should finish call or text conversations before driving. So you're not constantly checking the map make sure you know you location and how to get their b efore getting in. Even if you haven't finished a conversation just set your phone to do not disturbed so your not slightly distracted.

Cell phones are a great advancement in technology and make our live a lot easier, just not while doing 60 on the highway. The creation of handsfree make it easier to use your phone not safer. The inclusion of these in the attack of phone use in vehicles is step to safer roads. They should't be use in cars and need to be more heavily pressed upon before its too late.

Texting while driving can be a distraction from the road just by looking away for two seconds .

Driving is in need of all the attention on the road.

Just one mistake can cause a fatal crash on both parties. Drivers should not text and drive.

You will be tempted to want to pick up your phone especially if you're a new driver such as teenagers. For Example , "" There are reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes a year."" says the The National Safety Council. Another Example , "" Texting While driving causes 400 percent time of your eyes off the road. "" (Edger Snyder and Associates ) . Each year more that 1 million people die over texting and driving but the support of those who ban the right to text and drive is in the 94 percentile.

Teenage driving can be critical even for the parents. As teens are excited to have freedom to drive wherever they want they tend to be distracted just by looking at directions to a map.

For example, ""Teen drivers are 4x more likely than adults to get into car crashes or near-crashes when talking or texting on a cell phone."" ( Edger Snyder and Associates)

meaning the inexperienced drivers tend to feel like they can multitask better than adults but turns out not to be true . In 2017 "" 15, 341 drivers aged 15 -19 were involved in fatal accidents due to distractions off the road""

says cellphone and driving statistics .

""Nearly 48% of drivers admit to using their phones while driving .""

says a National survey on distracted driving attitudes and behaviors report in 2012.

Meaning drivers know how at risk their life including others are against and still continue to do so. ""In 2018 48 states banned texting and driving,"" says Issac and Issac after the excessive rate of fatal deaths in the previous year .

In Conclusion ,

Texting and Driving can never be a good thing no matter what the emergency might look on screen.

Your life is not worth losing over and small text that could've waited.

Each year the numbers rise of accidental deaths caused by distraction of the driver.      ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

I strongly agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents they are causing, it is causing one's insurance to rise, and it is causing concern to people's health issues. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences more than they are with their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like STDs. In the long run, it is deadly as well Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation so, it is quite natural to see many. So we really should not be driving with phone

Driving with phone cause more accident studies proves that also drunk driving One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. because cell phones can cause inattention blindness while driving, you are putting yourself and others around you in danger, and placing a ban on cell phone use while driving is proven to be effective and it sad because people are dying because someone else action the innocence always gotta to suffer because of someone else's mistakes and the facts that they were on the phone sop someone might be dead or in icu because of the driver who was on the phone chit chatting. Cell phone use while driving should be prohibited at all times for the following reasons; first of all it is a very distracting action, taking your eyes off the road is dangerous, and it's not worth the risk Anyhow cell phone use while driving is a very distracting action. Besides all driving is something that requires our full attention many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens that's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours sometimes we are distracted when we are at a stop sign or red light. however, we get lost in our own little world while we are talking or texting the person who is on the other side of their cell phone and then we are brought back to reality by the sound of a blaring horn from the car behind us. In reality talking and texting has a much greater effect on our minds than we think we are concentrating on the person who we are communicating with, choosing the words we speak, or concentrating on the letters we are pressing to text, completely oblivious to most things around us. That why ur so many accidents and people don't notice that.

Driving require our attention and we don't give it that much because our phone get all of it mobile phone use is dangerous but common because it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash Drivers' use of cell phones while vehicles are in motion should be prohibited because it is a vision distractor, it is law enforced, and it is a hazard to other drivers and passengers. Most importantly people should not use cell phones while driving. Importanly that kind of being incoredinte by other because if you want to be on the phone and while you drivng and alsmost kill yourself that doesn't mean you have jeopardized other life because you ready to end your by being on the phone it really fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example- increases your risk of crashing. Besides using your phone while driving is really stupid because that how you can really died and that a stupid way to died cause of a phone or kill other and by other i mean motorcycle driver, a pedestrian walking across the street and or someone braking suddenly in front of you last minute because you wasn't paying attention to the road you can also get serious and bad injury from accident you should not use the phone while driving because it can cause you your life and other and it also an distraction to the road because of cell phones use you can cause inattention blindness while driving you are putting yourself and others around you in danger and placing a ban on cell phone use. while driving is proven to be effective. Did you know that distracted driving comes in three forms? When you are using your cell phone while driving, you're doing all three types which are manual, visual, and cognitive. Manual distraction is when you are taking your hands off the wheel for even just a split second.

Five seconds is the average time your eyes are off the road while texting when traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field blindfolded Many people don't realize how risky texting and driving or talking on their cell phone and driving can be cell phone use while driving should be prohibited at all times for the following reasons; first of all it is a very distracting action, taking your eyes off the road is dangerous, and it's not worth the risk. To begin with, cell phone use while driving is a very distracting action first of all driving is something that requires our full attention many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens that's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours. Sometimes we are distracted when we are at a stop sign or red light however, we get lost in our own little world while we are talking or texting the person who is on the other side of their cell phone, and then we are brought back to reality by the sound of a blaring horn from the car behind us. In addition, talking and texting has a much greater effect on our minds than we think we are concentrating on the person who we are communicating with, choosing the words we speak, or concentrating on the letters we are pressing to text, completely oblivious to most things around us a lot of people even innocent people as well have had accidents involving one of those. Out of the three there has been one that has become more common, and it's only increasing if people don't put a stop to it themselves a usage of a cell phone should not be displayed at any point while driving It can wait many have had accidents even deaths because of reading or writing a simple text messages No text is worth dying for as technology keeps on evolving quickly you'd wonder it really worth my life or a text or simply just picking up my phone.

Some accidents are common while driving they can either be minor or a major accident that can possibly result in people not making it or many car accidents have gone to notice is because of small piece of technology we always carry around, which is our cell phones. Studies have shown a major increase in simple or huge accidents because of lack of attention on the road while driving That is because of the following, people using their cell phones Banning this should take place because of the accident can lead to something worse than just a small injury while driving your phone should be kept in a place you won't hear or see it deaths have been noticed because of the simple fact that drivers tend to pay more attention to their phone instead of the road Banning on the use of phones should be enforced this has affected many innocent people with losing their life because of a driver not paying attention. But it also has some good into using cell phones or even having one while driving benefits of cell phone while driving along is that you can use your phone to call roadside emergencies, car trouble, obtain personal information, or even navigation; however, it may lead to running red lights, drifting across lanes, or worse, causing accidents phones can do so many things, but most importantly they allow you to connect to emergency service its mot needed during roadside emergencies such as ambulance, police and firefighters. Studies have shown that the use of cell phones in emergency situations, such as calling for an ambulance, has improved its mortality rates having access to a cell phone is very important when it comes down to getting important information to that certain individual and when information needs to be passed to that individual as soon as possible. The most important part of having a cell phone is navigation cell phones allow users to call for direction when they cannot find their destinations.

In conclusion it pros and cons when using cell phones you have to use it for the right reasons and not to chit chat while on the highway or even on the road where you can cause other people their life and even people who are or even pedestrian walker because they also sometimes get killed because the car curved on the sidewalk it more than just your life that you protecting it other also everybody life matter.

GPS, Instagram, Facebook, in other words distractions shouldn't be allowed while operating a 2 ton vehicle capable of killing someone and yourself within seconds. With a split second decision you could be dead or responsible for a death for a text message or a video or post something that would've been there later on.

Did you know texting and driving is one of the leading causes of vehicle deaths. With just a slight 2 second check of a message can cause you to be in prisoned for vehicular homicide causing you not to be able to text, talk, and touch to that person as much as you want. You could your freedom behind it. Your Family could lose they child, cousin, sister, brother, niece or nephew behind a simple ""ok"". You could be preparing your family for a funeral or a court date. A casket or a cell. A T shirt or a Suit. Worse than that you could possible deal with the conscious of killing someone. 3,287 deaths because of distracted driving in 2018.

What apps are included in these ""distractions""? Should GPS count? GPS should count for 2 reason. While GPS has been very beneficial in the 20 century however in GPS requires attention of the driver. For instance the driver the driver missed what the GPS says and pick up the phone to check to see where to turn now while a minority of drivers have a type of device to hold their phone up near the face to be able to see without looking down but a majority of driver use there cup holder and with that they have to bring they attention off the road for a certain amount of time. Although that's that one driver issue it only takes one domino to knock the whole thing down meaning It can cause the whole street to be endangered. Also with GPS drivers tend to pull risky and immature decision to make a correction after missing a turn cause the proper procedures to not be follow and having other drivers confused which can cause a crash and more.

While driving do you ever think you're responsible for the whole car? The operator of the vehicle is responsible for everybody inside the vehicle. For instance god forbid (2x knocks on wood) say your operating a vehicle a with a family member you care for inside and you went to check a message for 0.9 second within that time you are partially over the on the express way you are struck by a tractor trailer on the right side cause your car to roll multiple times. Your roof in pounded inside and your family member is hurt traumatically. Now you're put in a situation you can't control because you made a decision you could've controlled. Would you be ok with being the murder of a loved one?

What about in case of an emergency? In case of an emergency you should have your destination set before driving and If not you should pull up to see how you should address the situation and in case you need to make a phone you should have a passenger assist and if there isn't one then pull along the shoulder and call who is needed while operating the car speaker could be an important sources or reliable resource.

In conclusion, use technology while driving isn't safe. I don't think it should be a thing. With the new technology in the 20century it will be possible to make calls text people back without even touching your phone just based off the development of technology. When you drive , drive safe for your family and for all that care about you and for safety of the other drivers.            ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Texting while driving is one of the worrying trends in the society, both teenagers and adults have developed a habit of using cell phones while driving. Texting while driving causes distraction and increases their chances of getting involved in car accidents. The government has made cell phone use in cars illegal, however not many people follow these laws.

The dangers of texting while driving includes thousands of people dying annually as the number keep on increasing because texting became popular. Even though fifty states have enacted laws that prohibit texting while driving, many of these laws are not reinforced by lawmakers to limit the number of driving accidents that occur annually.

Cell phones have been a big common factor among people. Now and days people depend on cell phones more than anything else. Cell phones have also advanced over the years with companies coming out with new smartphones and new technology. With the new smartphones there has been more distractions to people such as driving while texting. That's why people shouldnt operate a phone while driving.

Texting while operating an automobile has shown to be dangerous and hazardous to the person driving and the people around them. This is causing a significant amount of accidents and deaths. According to the text ""Using a cell phone while driving creates enormous potential for deaths and injuries on U.S. roads.""(NHTSA ). This statement it proving that being distracted by a smartphone can be dangerous and cause large amounts of accidents and deaths. When operating a vehicle people are allowed to use devices as long as they are hands free meaning that the device you are using must be voice activated so that both hands can be on the wheel at all times , but it is still proven to be a distraction to drivers. According to a psychology lecturer at the University of Sussex in England Graham Hole ""Talking on your phone while driving even if you use hands free connection is still dangerous.""because any conversation on the phone can be a distraction to the person surroundings.

This new generation of people and all the new smartphones and gadgets are causing people to be more dependent on cell phones than anything else. Everyday people walk around with their heads in there phones not paying attention to where their going. Now that people use vehicles for everyday use its is easy for them to get side track and use their phones while driving. With the new features on the updated smartphones you can do video calls and voice automated things on your phone. With these new features on smartphones people are more prone to using their phones while driving causing a higher risk of death and accidents.

Everyday someone is involved in a car accident because they were on there phone, texting while driving is the leading cause of death. There was a 7 year old boy named Xzavier Davis - Bilbo who was crossing the street and he was hit by a car and not only was he hit but the car dragged him 20 feet . The driver was texting on the phone when she hit 7 year old Xzavier . He spent months in the ICU and he is now paralyzed because of this. When people text and drive they put everybody around them in danger not just the people in the car with them.

In conclusion phones are a very distracting factor when driving and dangerous. Anything such as a hands-free device still shouldn't be allowed because it is still a distraction. These problems are injuring and killing people. People should not text and drive.                                                              ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Because too many accidents are happening causing people people to lose their loved ones and important people in their life. Another reason is because it is a law now and you shouldn't be breaking the law. Then it causes a lack of driving skills.

Everyday people die in car accident because they use cell phones. Over the past couple of years, over 1.5 million people have lost their life or loved one's due to people being on their phones while driving. Being on your phone while driving is so dangerous because you can hit somebody and cause a bad wreck possibly killing somebody, putting them in the hospital, making them paralyzed , and not just that, but losing your car. People should not use cell phones while driving because a person could be having a conversation, they might get upset, and it could cause the driver to lose control of the car.

People should not use cell phones while driving because it's a law you shouldn't want to break. If you are caught breaking the law of no cell phones while driving, it could result in bad consequences. Consequences like getting your license suspended, and not being able to drive until further notice. Also, you might get a ticket or taken to jail and that's something you don't want. If it's something so important that you have to check your phone, you should pull over or wait until you get to where you are going. They have invented a phone dock were you sit your phone while driving and I still think it's unsafe because people are still attempting to still use their phones while driving.

People who are usually using phones while driving seem to have lack of driving skills which causes the car to go off the road, maybe get too close to another car, and can end up in the lane next to them. Lack of driving skills is the biggest thing that most people have today. Using phones can cause drives to take their eyes off the road, their hands off the road. This appears to have the biggest impact on a lot of drivers that use their phones while driving.

People shouldn't use phones while driving. It would stop a lot pf car accidents, tickets, death lack of driving skills etc. If drivers put their phones down while driving this would save a lot of lives been taking due to car accidents. If people don't give up cell phones while driving, the number of fatalities on the road will increase each year. With all this being said,

For a while now since the early 2000s cell phones/smartphones has been a technological rise in the use of its kind. People use them daily for things like social media, internet surfing, reading, planning, alarms and more. There are many ways that the handheld ""easy to use"" technology can help people, but they also can be dangerous to us in many ways if we don't take fully responsibility in them and use them when we need them and when we don't. This leads to the harm of people who think they can be using their phones while they are driving.

Driving can be at times boring but using something to distract you from the focus of your own safety on the road isn't a good choice. They are plenty of reason why using cell phones while driving is bad. The most brutal things can happen while you're looking away just for a second. In my opinion the most brutal things that can happen while you're distracting yourself from driving is you killing yourself or someone else. The worst part about it is that you'll always remember what you've done just by your careless actions.

Most people would say it's not as dangerous or that if you're good at it then you can use your phone while you drive. That's not true at all because driving takes in a lot of focus and concentration in order to be a successful driver. Also, when you ARE driving you really must drive for yourself and everyone else because even though you're paying attention it doesn't mean everyone else is. It takes more than just the push of a pedal and the turn of a wheel. In my opinion while you're driving you should be at your most caution due to the risk and the things that could happen to you and anyone else.

Daily people end up either dead or injured badly due to the simple fact of a device that they should have mot being paying attention to. Since the handheld device has been put out it has caused thousands of deaths each year. In 2014 cell phones caused over 26 percent of the car incidents in the U.S. last year there where 1.5 million car incidents due to cell phones being involvement while driving. And of those incidents 58% of the drivers were teens. The rate of incident is increasing annually making driving even more difficult and complex then it already is.

So, the best thing to do is to just not handle a phone in anyway when you're driving. There are enough incidents already worldwide due to cell phone being a distraction for drivers. If you have an urge to pick up a phone or get texts or calls often while you're driving it'll be safer to just turn your phone off until you're in a safe position where you can handle it without any risk. Driving is something that should be done with seriousness and not to be tempted with. The roads would be safer and people would be safer if they start turning their phones off for a better solution to deaths by car crashes.

Recently, and especially among teens, there has been people texting and driving, this can cause a distraction and possibly a fatal or non fatal accident can happen,

Teen driving accidents. . According to EDGAR SNYDER AND ASSOCIATES ¨5,864 teen drivers ages 15-20 were involved in fatal car accident; 56% of teens admit to talking on cell phones while driving; 13% of teens admit to texting while driving. and 34% of teens age 16 and 17 admit that they send and respond to text messages while driving.¨ This information is very hard to ignore and it only proves that cell phone use while driving is extremely dangerous.

While some may say this is only amongst teens this is simply not true. There are also statistics of accidents with non adolescents.

Adults and Cell Phones During Driving . According to Sawaya Law; ¨The results of a survey published in USA Today show that while 98 percent of adults said that they know that texting or emailing while driving is unsafe, 49 percent admit to doing exactly that. According to the same survey, this is in comparison to 43 percent of teens who say that they text while driving.¨

In conclusion, the argument over if cell phones should be allowed when driving is an obvious one, they should not be allowed.

Attention taken away from the road will cause chaos in the streets. As the people who drive they need to take in account if they don't pay attention it may cost another person their life.

In conclusion, thousands of drivers cost countless lives in car crashes. Unlawful acts like texting and driving is banned in several states. Multiple drivers have bad timing when it comes to using their cell phone while driving. It only takes one to take another life with texting and driving. Almost every state in America has banned messaging while driving. Drivers are too late to hit the brakes to send that last text.

People should not use their cellphone while driving. Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons. One such reason is that.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Scott came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph."" Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of the rusty red Camaro the minivan full of kids."" Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. Any one of us could have been that poor individual on that fateful day. I used to ride my bike everywhere, mostly using the roads in the way that bikes are supposed to. That just proves that point that everybody.

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving. Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident. Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.

In addition, this has led to an increase in car accidents and increase of deaths by car accidents. This shouldn't be allowed due to the danger that you put yourself in and the danger you put the people around you and inside the car that are riding with you. Lastly this shouldn't be done because of the punishments that come with texting and driving.

04B9364C46DF,"Thousands of people died because of texting and driving. Every day one out of ten people are killed by distracted drivers and around 1000 people are injured in some way in crashes by these irresponsible distracted drivers. One of the most dangerous activities that many people do is texting while driving. It is extremely dangerous because people who do this are putting more attention in texting and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving which increases the chance that the driver can lose control of the vehicle and could cause a crash, or even worse, could kill other people. When a person is texting she or he is thinking about other things besides concentrating on driving. This is very dangerous, because it could make the driver lose control of the car and slow her or his brain's reaction time in case of a potential accident.

One of the dangers of texting and driving at the same time is the attention it takes away from the road. A driver who is focused on looking at their phone is not paying enough attention to other cars or what is happening around them. Something as simple as an animal running out in front of their car can cause serious damage to the vehicle and cause the driver to swerve and potentially hit another car. Texting while driving is the act of composing, sending, or reading text messages, email, or making other similar use of the internet on a mobile device while operating. Just by looking on your phone you can easily get yourself killed or kill someone without paying attention.

For this reason, it is very important that we find some ideas to break off this bad habit of texting while driving. I think that one of the easiest and best ways to break this habit is simply to turn off your phone. In this case the driver wouldn't be distracted by the ringing of the phone and it wouldn't make the driver to text while driving. Another way to break this habit is to download some of the new applications that can disable cell phones while people are driving. Also, there are other applications that automatically send a text to whoever is texting the driver to tell that person that she or he is driving, and that the text will be answered later. There are a great variety of applications to choose I think that we can use these to help us with the problem of texting while we are driving so that you as the driver will not get hurt.

Something as important as your own life is more important than your own cell phone. People all over the world need to realize how much danger they are putting other people in when they pick up that phone. It is not just other people you are putting in danger, but also yourself. If for one second you paid more attention to the road then you probably wouldn't be in a situation where you're severely injured or possible killing someone. There should be a law for your phone being out while you are driving because this problem will possibly never stop and will continue harming innocents around the world.

Cell phone have become very popular over the past few years. According to the iPhone the world is going crazy over them. There are about 7.53 billion people in this world and 3.3 billion people have phone. Some people use their phones for good reasons, for example, they may need to use their GPS but 50 percent of the time this is bad because the people would be more force on the directions then the road and 9 times out of 10 this will cause a car wreck! This is not safe at all.

People should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle because it's a distraction. When using a cell phone in the car you must look down and not up, when operating a car, you must be looking straight ahead and watching for red lights and stop sign. Also, must be watching for other cars when those cars are not paying attention.

Another reason you shouldn't use you phone and drive because you're more likely to found at fault for the accident that you may cause. Insurance rate hike, consider your passengers, consider other motorists, protect the pedestrians. It only takes a few seconds to park your car and use the phone. Its better if people should just use hand-free mode to regrade the racks and insurance.

Have you ever called someone while they are driving? If you have then, do you care about that person's life? Because if so then you shouldn't do it or hang up the phone because that will put that person you are on the phone with is in danger. This makes the driver focus on the call or texting someone back instead of focusing on the road and other drivers that could run into them and hurt them. Do you know what texting and driving can do to your life? There are also ways to prevent texting and driving. And there are people this has effected a lot of people's lives.

Texting and driving is a major danger to your life. If someone is texting and driving and or talking on the phone that means they are not focused on the road or not focused on the other drivers that could possibly merge over and wreck the driver and possibly kill the person. This is a major problem because everyone has the urge to check their phone if they hear it go off with a text ding because everyone think that all calls are possibly an emergency but either that emergency or your life. There are many ways to prevent this.

You can prevent texting and driving many ways. One way to prevent texting and driving is to put your phone on silent or turn it off while driving in a vehicle. That will take the urge of texting someone back or answering a phone call until you get to your destination. If everyone done this when they got in the driver seat of a vehicle there would be less death my car because that is a hug percentage of the reason vehicular accidents happen behind drunk driving. And that effects people's life not just the person involved but the family.

This effect a lot of people's life when someone uses a cellphone when they drive because mostly every time they end up in a car wreck. This can affect the driver or passengers in the car because there are cases where people get paralyzed or brain damage or even worse die in car accidents. That can ruin the rest of their life plan. This can also ruin some families lives by having to care for you while you can't for yourself or sometimes the death case they must deal with you not being there the rest of their life. That's why people should not use cell phones while driving.

In my opinion Cell phones and driving is not ok. They can really ruin someone's life and people can also stop this by using some tips and not using it at all while driving. And this can hurt your life and anyone around you or that knows you. Please don't use a phone and drive I have people I care about on the roads and someone that uses a phone and drives can hurt them on the road and I love them and don't want something to happen to them because someone couldn't put down their phone.

""In a split second you could ruin your future, injure or kill others, and tear a hole in the heart of everyone who loves you"", said by the mother of a texting while driving victim. The majority of people today use a smart phone on a daily basis. While cellphones have their pros and cons, there is one controversial issue that seems to triumph over the rest, and that is using a cell phone while driving. Operating a cell phone while driving can be extremely hazardous. By following the law and removing phones from behind the wheel, we can eliminate a monumental amount of deaths worldwide.

While some people really can multitask with a phone while operating a vehicle, everyone is not capable of this. Texting and driving is against the law for a reason. This law was put in place to protect us humans from traumatic car accidents.

Some may argue that it's okay to text & drive if you have a self driving car (Requires minimal driver's assistance) but numbers don't lie. According to the NHTSA, there was a Tesla fatality every 86 million miles in 2017, which is 40,000 deaths. Now imagine the amount of accidents in cars that don't drive themselves. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.

Now all of these accidents can be eliminated if we as humans just put away their cell phones while behind the wheel. Whatever is being done on one's phone can't wait. A text message is not worth a life.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
DE835E3F1E2D,"Texting and Driving

Phones are common in everyday life and everyone has one. When you're driving though a phone can be a factor between life and death or fatal in some way. About 8% of total distracted driving crashes are due to cell phone use (Distracted Driving). Crashes even happen when people reach for their device. When you're out driving somewhere it's better to not pull your phone out at all because you take your eyes off the road, you put yourself and others at risk, and it's banned in a lot of states to even be using (Facts + Statistics).

Taking your eyes off the road for just a couple of seconds anything can happen. If you're driving 55mph and you take your eyes off the road for five seconds, which is about the average time someone takes to do something on their device, you could cross an entire football field (4 Reasons). Anything can happen within five seconds the car in front of you could stop, you could run a red light or miss a turn. When you take your eyes off the road you also take your mind of the road.

So obviously if you're not paying attention to the road you put yourself and others in danger, weather they're in the car with you of outside walking someone can get seriously hurt or even die. It's terrible to see something happen to someone just because they were texting and driving or reaching for their phone don't be that person, it makes you look like you don't care about anyone or anything. If you're driving fast and swerve you could crash into a building and that would be bad for you and for everyone else, you won't know what's going to happen after the moment you hit the building debris can hit someone, the building could fall, it would be a terrible accident.

Although texting and driving is technically not illegal it is banned and you can be fined or in some states spend some time in jail (Texting and Driving). Most states ban texting and driving but not hand held devices. Most states ban novice drivers from using cell phones in general or having them on them at all (Texting and Driving). Around 1.6 million crashes are caused by texting and driving every year and that's 1 of every 4 crashes (Distracted Driving). It's worse than drinking and driving.

So in general it's not worth pulling out or even reaching for your device if it increases the chance of a car accident happening (Motor Vehicle Safety). There are many things that can go wrong it doesn't just have be car collision you could hit something, swerve, miss a turn, drive straight into traffic, etc. There are so many little things you do when driving that are important to your safety that you probably don't even realize. So if you're driving stay away from the phone.

01C01DD07859,"I do not think individuals should have the right to use a cellular device for any reason none whatsoever while driving vehicles. Driving while engaged in any activity that could divert a persons attention from the primary task of driving. Distracted driving can fall under 3 different categories which are (visual: taking your eyes off the road), (manual: taking your hands off the wheel.), and (cognitive: taking your mind off what you are doing). The Harvard center of risk analysis shows a study of that estimates cell phone use while driving contributes to 6% of crashes, which equates to 636,000 crashes, 330,000 injuries and 2,600 deaths each year including a tab that is $43 billion .

Activities that can be distractive are cellphone usage, eating, drinking, reading, changing the radio station, doing makeup, doing hair, talking to passengers in the car. The reason why I chose this is because during the year there are 1.6 million crashes each year. Although, nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. The other reason why I chose this decision is because when you send or read a text message, you take your eyes off the road for about 5 seconds, long enough to cover the length of a football field while driving at 55 mph. However, 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States I caused by cell phone usage. Approximately, each day in the United States 9 people are killed more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to be involved by a driver distracted by their cellular device.

During the past years there have been 1.6 million car crashes each year. The people that text while driving are 23 time more than likely to have a car wreck and pass away. However, texting while driving take your eyes off the road for 5 seconds at a time which means your eyes are of the road for a distance of 300 feet. Although, many people in the world expects a reply from a total of 2-5 minutes which puts tremendous pressure on them that makes them want to respond faster. However, 60% of drivers admit to using their cellphones while driving. 3,328 people were killed and 421,000 people were injured in accidents involving distracted drivers in 2012. Even though you don't think about it but texting increases your crash risk to 23% more than when not distracted.

In the United States automobiles are a way of life and car accidents are an inevitability. Although, teens think it is so important to text while driving 143 million that communicate daily, there's no doubt that car accidents are bound to happen to be no end in sight. Yearly roughly 1.3 million people die from worldwide car accidents. There is an average of 3,287 deaths per day. From the age of 15-44 they are responsible for all road traffic deaths. Most fatal crashes led to 37,461 total fatalities, including 25,096 vehicle occupants, 5,286 motorcyclists, and 7,079 nonoccupants. The ages 16-19 year old has the higher risk of motor vehicle crashes. However, 15% of drivers ages 15-20 involved in fatal crashes had a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or higher. Nearly 1.25 million people die in road crashes each year. While on the other hand on average 3,287 deaths a day. However, 20-50 million people are injured during car crashes.

E7A9A03DCF42,"The Risk of Texting and Driving

Over the last few years, texting or talking on the phone has been a rising problem for drivers. According to the National Safety Council, 1.6 million crashes a year are caused by cell phone use, and because of this, I believe cell phone usage should be banned for those operating a vehicle.

In 2106 alone, 263 teenagers were killed because of cell phone usage while driving. Some of these deaths were not even the teenagers fault, but instead because of a distracted driver crashing into them. Even though texting and driving causes so many deaths, the NHTSA has reported that approximately 660,000 drivers use electronic devices while driving every single day. Why would people continue to use cell phones while driving every day when they know how much of a risk there is? I believe it is for one of two main reasons. Either they are impatient or they aren't worried because they don't think it will happen to them.

As for being impatient, I understand that some people are curious of what a text is or they want an answer to a question, but because of the risk to yourself and those around you, it's worth waiting to answer. Now for those who don't think it will happen to them. Nobody believes that anything they hear about online or on TV will happen to them, but I am almost positive that every person who has died in a car accident, woke up that morning believing the same thing. If you really need to respond to someone immediately for some reason, wait until you are at a red light or a stop sign, or if it's really an emergency just pull off the road for a minute and respond.

There are so many ways to prevent accidents for reasons like these that I don't see why we should need a law. I wish that people would stop texting and driving simply because of the horrible consequences that can come from it. Imagine being a parent at work one day, and all of a sudden you get a call saying that your child had been killed in a car accident. Just by responding to one text, there can be consequences that permanently affect the people and families of the people around you. It's not worth that risk, not to me anyway.

0943248DA301,"Devices are a distraction for drivers on the road because it always takes aways the drivers attention of the safety of passengers in the vehicle. Another way devices are distractions, it limits your safe driving capacity. Drivers shouldn't be allowed to be on their device while driving because it causes accidents, driver's insurance rate rises and because hand free technology is available.

One reason why drives shouldn't be on their device while driving is because they cause accidents. According to edgarsnyder. org, ""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United Statesis caused by texting and driving."" From this evidence it states that devices are a threat to the safety of the driver and other drivers on the road.

Another reason why drivers shouldn't be allowed to use their device on the road is because the driver's insurance rate goes up. According to carinsurance. com,""In Georgia insurance rates with a clean record is $1,776 but after a texting while driving ticket the insurance rate increases into $2,195."" Insurance Policies does not take texting and driving as a joke; it causes accidents and insurance companies know that too.

One more reason on why drivers shouldn't be allowed to text and drive is because of the availability of hands-free technology in cars. According to strike. au, ""Hands-free technology is arguably one of modern day's most convenient inventions. Our phones are such an integral part of our busy lives and going without them for any amount of time can be detrimental to our day-to-day business dealings. Hands-free technology enables us to talk to people without having to touch a button. Modern day Bluetooth hands-free devices often operate on voice control alone which means that we don't even have to touch a button. Voice control limits distraction and subsequently limits the dangers associated with touching phones when driving."" From this evidence you can understand that Hands-free technology is the resolution to the problem of texting and driving. With its voice recognition tech you can easily send a text without any distraction keeping your eyes away from the road.

Texting and Driving is a serious topic to talk about because people who text and drive risk many lives on the road, threatening other drivers who are perfectly driving and threatening the driver passengers lives. Driver shouldn't be allowed to use their device while driving because it causes accidents, raises insurance rate for the driver and the availability of hands-free technology.

Over 400,000 casualties occur annually due to distractions while driving (Vegega, pg 3). Many of these distractions are due to phones, an ever-growing distraction for drivers. Due to this risk drivers should not be able to use phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because of the growing threat towards drivers and pedestrians and potential cost of damages.

Since recent years phones have been a more common distraction for drivers. Growing distractions such as the usage of cellular devices poses a threat to drivers. From 2012 to 2015 crashes involving cell phones have increased by 15% from roughly 60,000 to 69,000 (NHTSA, pg 3). Therefore the usage of cellular devices while driving has led to a growing threat for drivers. Furthermore, distractions while driving also poses a risk to pedestrians. Of the 3450 fatalities in the US during 2016 caused by car crashes due to distractions 462 (13%) are pedestrians (NHTSA, pg 3). This means distractions such as cell phone usage put pedestrians at serious risk when a car crash occurs. Overall, cell phone usage while driving poses a growing danger toward drivers and pedestrians.

Phone usage while driving can cost vast amounts for both governments and drivers. Damaged caused by crashes due to distractions is expensive to replace or repair. In 2010 the cost of damage due to distracted drivers was $22 billion, which is about $26 billion in 2019 (Vegega, pg 3). This data reveals that car crashes due to distractions cost countries billions to remedy, an expense which far outweigh any positives. In addition, drivers also risk paying fines for cell phone usage. In states such as Delaware fines can cost upwards of $50 and come with court fees upwards of $100 (Chaudhary, pg 3). This means that drivers can face severe financial penalties due to cell phone usage while driving. In brief, the financial cost of crashes due to distractions far outweigh the benefits of cell phone use.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use phones in capacity while operating a vehicle due to the risk towards drivers and pedestrians and enormous financial cost. While driving, drivers are exposed to many types of distraction however, distractions such as phones are in complete control of the driver.

In the world today, many people used technology such as cell phones, computers, or laptops. A lot of people are addicted to things, but the cell phone might be the worst addiction of them all. Cell phones are so addicting that people are risking their lives for them. Driving while using your cell phone is a very dangerous thing to do. Humans should not be able to use their cellular device while driving because it is too dangerous and they are putting other people lives in danger and also their own.

Using any cellular devices while driving is in fact dangerous, people are putting other human beings lives at risk because when you are on your device while driving, you are not paying attention to the road. Paying attention to the road is extremely important because that is what you are supposed to do while driving. So many human beings are putting other people lives in danger by being selfish with their lives. Driving while using your cellular devices should be prohibited.

Some people may think that driving while using your cellular device is totally okay. Those people think that if their using their phones while driving, they have an advantage of being a ""pro"" at driving. Other reasonings may be using their devices for navigation or crime reporting, and those are good reasons. Though you can not be too sure of using the cellular devices while driving.

In conclusion, using your electronic device while driving should not be allowed because people are putting others lives in danger. Those people are also putting their own lives in serious danger.

Nowadays, most people have a cell phone and use them in everyday life. People own cars as well. Imagine mixing the two, phones and cars, using the mobile devices while driving. That doesn't seem so smart but most people do it anyways and it's very dangerous. ""Why is it dangerous?"" you may be thinking. Maybe you're just changing the song playing because it's an annoying one that just started and you don't liked it, maybe someone texted you, maybe your mom is calling you. As simple as changing the song, texting back, or talking to someone on the phone sounds, it's very dangerous. Doing so is known for causing most car accidents today, if the impact is bad then it could lead to death.

Using a mobile device while operating a vehicle is illegal and you'll get pulled over for it if you get caught by a cop. As bad as it already is, yes, hundreds and thousands of people still do it every single day. Maybe the person doing so didn't get pulled over or didn't get in a car accident, but one never knows when that is going to happen. That day can happen sometime today, or tomorrow, or sometime next week. Whether one is bored in traffic, it's still not a good idea to be using the phone.

As for having a hands-free Bluetooth device, that's the only possible outcome for one using a cellular device while operating a vehicle. A Bluetooth is a source of operating a connection between anything, in a vehicle, most people use the connection for their phones so they can drive without touching their phone so they don't have to let go of the steering wheel. Having a Bluetooth is a very helpful and beneficial device to have inside a vehicle.

People tend to think you should be able to use your phone while driving, not for texting or phone calls, but for directions or a GPS. If one is using their phone for directions to a place then that should be okay. They don't have to be holding their phone as well which is even better. The person with their GPS on, can purchase a phone stand or phone holder that they can install inside of their vehicle. The benefit of having this is that it's both safe, and affordable. With the stand/holder being safe, no phone has to be held with one hand and the other on the steering wheel. One will just have to glance at it for a second or two so they're aware of where they're going. As well as being affordable, it won't hurt purchasing one from your nearest store, it's found inside many stores and pharmacies. Some cars nowadays come with a Bluetooth installed already in the car, so if one's car has it or not, there should be a consideration in purchasing one.

In conclusion, using your phone while driving is very dangerous, but that's why there are Bluetooth and hands-free calls now which makes everything better and safer. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle, unless they have a Bluetooth device, which either way, they have to be safe and careful for their safety.

I believe that people being allowed to operate a motor vehicle must never also be allowed to have their phone in their hand while doing so. Cell phones make driving much more dangerous by distracting the driver from the road. In 2019 The state of Georgia made it illegal for driver's to have their phones in their hand while driving. This law is called the ""Hands-Free"" law. Since this law has been put into place a lot more Georgia driver's have been able to reach their destinations.

I'm on the side of banning any amount of cellphone usage while driving, texting and driving is extremely dangerous and has been proven time and time again of being one of the most common causes of death in the United states. Fun fact actually, more people die from texting and driving than from sharks... So why do we keep letting people do something that we know is more dangerous than swimming with sharks? Because people nowadays are almost addicted to being on their phones. People have become too consumed in the fake reality of phones and social media that they value texting while driving more than their own life it seems. And because of that I strongly believe that driver's should NOT be able to use their phone in any capacity while driving. Sure they may be helpful with navigation and helping you find out where to go, but there are also a million other different distractions that come with the cell phone like the notifications, emails, ringtones, snapchats, and tweets that also come with it and are completely unnecessary while driving.

I hope that society comes to their senses and realizes how dangerous and unnecessary phones are when it comes time to drive a motor vehicle. A text can always wait, but someone's life cannot, a text or phone call is never worth the life of a person.

10BA402D35D6,"In my opinion i truly believe that people should not be able to use or operate cell phones while driving. There a several reason that i think support this theory. For instance the danger factor, driving while on the phone can pull your concentration from anything and everything that you do. These distractions can easily cause a accident which is putting your life and future at risk. I personally think that the cons of driving and using your phone far outweigh the pros and here why.

One of the reasons that i think that driving and using the phone is unacceptable is because it causes a major distraction. Diverting your attention from driving a vehicle at any time is a enamours mistake because it only takes seconds to crash. Making a small text or call can easily cause you thousands in damages to your car and even another civilians car. Not to mention it can also create a complications with the insurances companies and cause a spike in your current insurance rate.

Another big risk and something that is common among drivers nowadays is being sued. This does not occur very often but can be one of the most troubling and biggest hits to a person's pocket. One second your looking at your phone to check and text and the next you're dealing with a lawsuit that can cause you to pay thousands upon thousands of dollars. When in a scenario like this the opposing person can claim any kind of allgulations weather they be true are not, and you must be liable to either pay up or fight the case in court.

What really are some pros of driving and texting and calling anyway? For me there's not much that i can really think of. It's clear that the cons outweigh the pros, so why even take the risk. Not only is it a risk to your life buts it's also a risk to your pocket and can be hazardous to other people. In con conclusion to my research i truly believe that texting and driving or doing anything on your phone is definitely unacceptable in modern life.

8DF0E47ED8DF,"Driving with a phone isn't always a bad thing, sometimes people have a valid reason to be driving with their phone and aren't always trying to just goof around. Like, for example, when I drive, I have to use my phone whenever my mom or dad call me or I have to call my mom to tell her if I have practice or not after school.

Most people don't have newer cars that have built-in GPS, or even a touch screen which means they have to use their phone if their driving out of town and need a GPS or need to use their phone to contact a friend or family member to make sure there in the correct places to get where they're going.

Last year during soccer season, I had to call my mom in order to let her know if our practice was ever cancelled or ask her to bring me food before the game, which meant she was using her phone while driving home after work, but was for a good reason. My mom has an older car that has a touch screen put into, it but she still has to take her eyes off the road to answer the phone on the touch screen which is just like using her phone, so what's the point of her not being able to use her phone?

The average cost of a 2018-19 car is about twenty to thirty thousand dollars and even though they come with a built in touch screen, the average American can't afford a newer model car. This means they get a touch screen built in, if possible, but even using a touch screen can be as distracting as a phone. This shouldn't make people who have to use their phone a bigger target than someone who is using a touch screen who could be doing ever knows what. So using a phone while driving shouldn't be something worthy of being pulled over for.

True texting and driving seems bad and is the cause of about every car wreck. Most people still text and drive, but they focus their attention mainly on the road when driving or they use it while at a stop sign or on an open road. Texting while driving shouldn't be seen as such a big deal as long as you're at a complete stop while driving due to the fact that you can't always pull over to somewhere safe to use your phone if you're heading somewhere new for the first time.

Over all, texting while driving isn't something you should always do, but shouldn't be something you be fined $50 dollars for. If anything, it should just be at most for the first offence $15, and after that $25. Everyone has used their phone at least once while driving since the hands-free law was passed. Most people who didn't follow the law were probably using their phone for something important, others maybe not. But, when texting and driving, you should always be aware of your surroundings and try to use it when you're at a complete stop or able to pull over.

Many lives has been taken because of texting and driving or driving and being on the phone. Today people should not be able to use their phones because of the crashes and the lives taken. CellPhones has not been around for so long but they have become a part of our lives.

People are picking and choosing the wrong time to answer their phone and to text somebody back . Today people are so focused on what they can do at one time instead of focusing on the street and trying not to hurt themselves or somebody else .

Today people do not think about other people when using their cell phone they be so focused on keeping in touch with everyone and making themselves.

If you get caught while using a cellphone you will get a warning and if they catch you again then you get a ticket .

CA35ACF73786,"We have been using cell phones on a daily basis that we've gotten used to it, but people think they will be able to drive normally even if they are using their phone. Well, they are wrong, using phones while driving lead too many people in car accidents, killing other people, and you'll be fined much money, even if you don't crash or anything like that. People shouldn't be allowed to drive and use their phone for theirs and others safety.

While many people think using their phone while driving isn't hard, but there have been tons of accidents because of people using their phones while driving. ""In 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 391,000 injured in crashes involving distracted drivers."" This shows that car accidents are now a more commonly known way people die. Usually, a car accident only involves 3 or 4 people are involved so if the number of killed and injured are so high then that shows that the number of car accidents is also high. That shows that people can't be on their phones and driving.

Driving and usage of phones do cause accidents; it could also cause the driver to run over people. ""A staggering 37,461 people were killed on US roads in 2016, an increase of 5.6 percent from the previous year, according to just-released statistics from the US National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration."" All of these accidents have occurred ever since phones came out and that's because we all think we are able to multitask. When it comes to driving we need all of our attention on it and not anywhere else because then we don't see people crossing the road. All these deaths are being cause by the fact that we can't leave our phones until we get to our destination.

After many years of distracted driving the US is finally doing something about it, they instated a law that if you are caught using your phone or it's just in your lap you'll be fined. ""Motorists operating commercial vehicles who violated the distracted driving law are subject to a civil penalty of up to $2,750."" That may seem too much money for a small thing, but it could save many lives including your own. Using your phone won't only get you fined, it'll also get your license suspended, which you won't be getting back for a long time. With just one time using your phone while driving will take your money, which you worked hard to get.

In conclusion, people should learn that using their phone while driving will only lead to bad things. Even if it's the first time you've used your phone while driving, you'll get the same consequences as if it was done in the past.

F32DC9C20C98,"The Risks of Phones While Driving

Technology has been a part of our lives for many years. Within these years, technology has progressed. As it progresses, it causes people to stop paying attention to what needs to be done. This loss of attention can cause different situations to occur such as bumping into other people or hitting a wall while walking. Just as phones are a distraction while doing everyday activities, they are also a distraction while driving. They cause people to not pay attention to the cars around them; they don't know how or when to break, they may roll through a stop sign or just might hit another car all together because they were not focused on what they needed to be focused on. Consequences come with the actions that people take. If a person is not paying attention to the road, then he could cause an accident just as if someone is not paying attention to the person in front of him, he might run into them. There are minor and major risks that come with people being on the phone while driving. Using phones while driving should not be allowed because it is a risky idea and can cause accidents as well as legally affecting a person's driving history.

To begin with, driving is not an activity to do just for fun. It should be taken seriously and all of a person's attention should be on the road. As a result of the loss of attention to the road whether it be visual, manual or cognitive; phones cause accidents. When someone is not paying attention, his reaction time is slower. This could include not paying attention and thinking about everything but what is on the road, a person not having his hands on the wheel or not having his eyes on the road. Because of these things, there are some accidents that are minor where the other vehicle is hit and only leaves a dent in the vehicle where they were hit. But also, some accidents are serious enough to have one or both vehicles totaled, has someone seriously injured or someone could even lose a life from the careless actions of the other driver. So many people have died or have been seriously injured from the careless actions of drivers being on the phone and there is nothing that anyone can do to take it back. Someone's life cannot be taken back. It is not possible to take back hitting someone and paralyzing them or giving them brain damage because of the amount of impact they got from the car that hit them. There are ways to prevent anyone from being in any kind of situation like these. If riding alone, the phone should be in a position where it is hard to reach and should only be touched when at a complete stop or if the car is turned off. No type of notification is worth losing a life over. Also, have the phone where it will not move or slide in places that are hard to reach. If the phone falls underneath the break, it is very dangerous, and it is just as dangerous trying to reach it while driving. Another way to keep everyone on the road safe is to make sure that when passengers are in the car, that everyone understands and respects the rules of the car. Having passengers in the car could be a huge distraction just like phones. Also, having someone to respond to messages and alerts will help eliminate any possible problems. Keeping the car distraction free, especially phone free, will cause for a better rate for not just teenage drivers but all drivers.

Legal actions are also something to consider when someone is driving with a phone in his possession. Seeing police officers on the road instantly puts a fear in people and will cause for a change in actions by the driver. People know what is right and wrong but still do as they please. Hands free driving is a law and it is broken on a daily. People try to alter the law and make it to where it best fits their needs. If an accident is caused because of the carelessness of a driver being on the phone while driving, police marks that on a person's license and too many marks could later lead to the suspension of a person's license. Being on the phone can take time and money away from a person.

Phones are not the only distractions that can go on while someone is driving. They could be talking too much, looking at the stores, signs or other cars or eating. Although these things can be done in a matter of seconds, those few seconds can quickly change. There is so much to life and always being on the phone will never get anyone there especially when driving. A lot of people already do not pay attention without phones and having a phone makes it worse. Whatever it is that comes to your phone can wait. Multitasking while driving is never worth the risk of being hurt or losing a life. It is not worth a life.    ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8
6398767E04C4,"In my opinion I think cell phones shouldn't be used while driving because it has a big impact on the people. It has bad causes such as people getting into life threatening wrecks and people can't just focus on the road. People use them to text while driving and they thousands die because of it every year. It has a terrible impact on today's society because we can't put phones down.

Phones are not good to the public because people can't focus on the road and the environment surrounding them. Even though you can call the authorities with a swipe of a finger, they are the reason they get into the wrecks. I feel like if you have an emergency you should pull over instead of stopping and causing a wreck. People just don't think about the outcome of using phones while driving. People only don't have to look out for themselves but other drivers.

Phones not only distract us from the road but from our day to day life. They distract us from spending time with our families and friends. It also distracts us from watching movies. It distracts us from just the good moments we have and share. Phones are a very distracting thing to our lives and they need to be put down for a bit so we can have some actual time to ourselves. Everyone sticks to social media now and it just isn't good.

In Conclusion phones are no good to us and our day to day life. I think people shouldn't text and drive or just be on their phones in general because it could be fatal to your health if you get a wreck or just looking at your surroundings.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

When it goes off while they are driving whether it is a message, social media or a phone call, curiosity seems to get the best of them and they feel as if they have to look now. Using cell phones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It does not matter how good you are at multitasking, it should be forbidden and against the law entirely. Here are just a few reasons for that.

Social media and any other written phone alert. To stop and read this message or update you would have to take your eyes off of the road for longer than the recommended time of the one second, it takes to check the rearview mirror. It is extremely dangerous to type or read while driving. It is a hazard to everyone on the road, so it is not just your own life you are risking.

As for making phone calls, this too should be banned. I understand that sometimes your family members or important calls may call needing you to stop somewhere on the way home, or you think it may be an emergency. If that is the case, then pull over to the side of the road, take the call, and then return to driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason to pick up your phone while driving your car due to the hazard of the road you are putting your safety and other's safety at risk.

Even hands-free devices that allow us to talk on the phone while driving with both hands on the wheel are still a hazard. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a; lot of its energy into the conversation. This means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction.

Whatever it is can almost always wait until you get where you are going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Pull over to the side and tell the person you are trying to text that your driving and it's dangerous. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be as convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many teenage lives to Tweets or texts if they know their license could be taken if they do look.   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving statistics shows that multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life threatening norm. talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media post takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent.

It is also illegal in some states to use a phone while driving. Even though they passed these laws many people do ignore it and put many people in danger.

One of the dangers of using a phone and driving is it distracts from users from the road. Someone who is distracted from the road has the potential to injure or even kill someone. There have been many instances where people have been hit by a distracted driver. Statistics show that as many as 3,287 people get killed a day by distracted drivers in 2018. This can be devastating to the deceased person's family and traumatizing to the driver. You could go to jail for manslaughter and ruin your background, so you will not get a good job when or if you get out.

If you get caught on your phone while driving by police, you could be taken into custody or get a ticket. In the state of Massachusetts, any novice driver found to be texting while driving is subject to a $100 fine, a sixty day license suspension, and a required attendance of a ""driver attitudinal retraining course."" The penalties only increase for minors.

According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

People whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car.

Regardless of the dangers, individuals still use cell phones since they need to be constantly accessible and stay in contact with other individuals.

Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone.

Phones have been around for several of years. They have become a crucial part of everyday society. They actually make life easier. These devices help with communication, entertainment, & education. Though they help with all these things phones also hinder us. Human have become dependent on their phones. We don't know what to do without them. We use them at wrong times. For example when we are driving. Drivers use their phones all the time. Some times for the right reason. Some times for the wrong. There has been an age old debate asking if drivers should be able to use their phones while driving. I believe that drivers should be able to use their phone while driving

I say drivers should be able to use their phones while driving, but to an extent. Drivers should be able to use their phones to perform certain task. For example they should be able to use their phones for directions. I feel that is a reasonable reason for drivers to be on their phone. It can prevent drivers from getting lost on the road. It can help people get to their destination if they get lost. Also I feel talking on the phone can be an acceptable while driving. Even though people will take advantage of that privilege it's important to have that ability.

Even though I feel people should be able to use their phones I see where people's concern comes from. Humans have a tendency to get distracted very easy. This has been proven several times. Driving is something that requires a lot of concentration and adding phones to the mix can make it harder. Though this is true people can multitask. Also there are ways for the government to make using your phone and driving is safe. Put regulations in play that limit the use of phones. I feel that would solve a lot of the problems around this topic.

I believe the people should be able to use their phone while driving. There's really nothing you can do to stop people from doing it. Instead of trying to make it illegal just put some regulations in play. That will give the people what they want while making it safe to drive. These are reasons why I feel people should be allowed to use their phone while driving.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Phones and driving is where you text, call, or use your phone in any way. It's very dangerous and I think people should not be able to do it to keep them safe and the other people around them safe as well. Many things can happen when being distracted from driving such as a little crash as a bump to a car or can be as serious as hitting someone or injuring yourself it can also lead to your or even someone else death.

In most cases people from the age 18-33 admitted to using the phone while driving about 59% of them. They say the reason they do this is because they feel as if they are safe and wont crash, but some of them have admitted that they have been involved in an accident.

Some people feel as if sending a simple text won't do any harm so it's fine to respond or if someone is calling they should pick it up rather than let it ring.

Using your phone while driving is a very dangerous thing to do because it can cause a lot of damage and can make some people pay lots of money. Some people don't realize how bad it is to do these things because the people who do it are the ones who have been involved in an accident.

There are many different consequences some can be $20-$500 but if you kill or harm others than if can be jail or prison time all the way up to life in prison one thing that can happen is you can kill yourself doing this or kill a kid who could grow up to be the president or the person to find the cure for cancer or just a very important person. Using you phone might not get you killed but it can get others killed.

In conclusion using your phone for any reason isn't worth it because not only are you in danger but others as well. If I were you I wouldn't use your phone because even if you don't get caught that means you'll do it again and the next time you do than that could be the time you get hurt or killed. What I think new could do to keep this from happening is putting cameras around the roads to see who uses their phone and write them a ticket and or fine them.

FF62E6972211,"In today's society, a majority of people use cellular devices in their every day. Amazingly, over 62.9 percent of the population has mobile devices. Of course, it is incredible that such a large amount of people can have these devices; however, with all these people can come to many accidents. In this case, texting and driving can become a significant problem when many people have cellular devices. Texting and driving cause many issues on the road and drivers should not be able to use these cell phones while operating a vehicle.

The main reason for using a cell phone while operating a vehicle should not be allowed because it is proven to increase the chance of fatal accidents on the road. May researchers can attest to the fact that when cellular devices are in use while the driver is also operating behind the wheel accidents are more likely. Cell Phones reduce the mental capacity of the person performing the automobile; which can lead to slower reaction times, perception, and slower breaking times/speeds. All of these traits can attribute to more automobile crashes, some that could even be fatal.

The second reason why drivers should not be able to be behind the while using s phone is that insurance rates will rise. As more accidents continue to happen due to a cellphone-distracted driver insurance companies will decide to raise the prices of insurance. This will, of course, hurt many of us who may not have the money for a high insurance bill every month. However, if drivers were not to use their cellular device while driver we would not have to worry about this situation. Thus, drivers not being able to use their cellphone is a win-win situation for everyone.

On the hand, some people may disagree and say that drivers should be able to use their cell phone while drivers. These people may believe that if you drive while texting that your sense of alertness may become better and make you better at multitasking since you have to do both at the same time. However, there is no reliable scientific proof using your phone while being behind the wheel Makes you better at multitasking. There is scientific evidence that doing so does the exact opposite, which is why my claim that drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving.

In conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cellular devices while operating an automobile. The main reasons are because of the risk it can put on not only the drivers but others, and the risk of increased insurance rates. Some may argue that using your phone and driving makes you better at multitasking, however, that is just false. I hope my essay has allowed you to see the reasons why we should not use our phones and drive.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business runniTherefor others of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency.

You hear this everywhere, from Television commercials to regalatory road signs on the highway, ""Don't text and drive.'' This phrase has so much meaning to it, saving the lives of many if actually doing what it's telling you to do. Texting and driving is illegal and it should stay as that. Sometimes being able to connect with the world with only a few taps of your fingertips to a screen can have it's cons especially when it comes in the way of you and your driving. Which can affect your attention span in driving, putting innocent lives plus your life at risk and being more likely to crash while doing it.

Driving should be something you put all your attention to when doing it. Keeping your eyes on the road, having both hands on the steering wheel and a foot to the brakes & gas are the only things you should be doing when driving. Phones are a distraction to this and cause you not to put all your focus into handling your motor vehicle. Imagine your driving 55 mph, you take your eyes off the road for a few seconds just to check if someone texted you back that's like if you were driving the length of a football field with your eyes closed. Anything can happen within those few seconds, things can go sideways just with a snap of a finger.

According to Carsurance. net, In 2018 there were 4,637 deaths alone related to the use of a mobile device while conducting. Today, there is an average of 9 deaths and 1,000 injuries per day. Is it really worth putting that happy family crossing the street to get to their favorite ice cream shop on a sunny day at risk? Not only are you putting innocent lives at risk but your also jeopardizing your own life as well and whoever else's life is in your hands. That would come out very bad for you even if you get hurt as well.

Texting and driving can be the equivalent to driving under the influence, in many cases they both end up leading with bad turnouts. Some might think that driving under the influence of drugs/alcohol is worse but in reality texting and driving is. Even though you're under the influence you still have an idea of your surroundings and have caution. When it comes to texting and driving you're not aware at all of whats going on around you or can see what can happen.

Every person should have the same mindset about texting and driving or think more on it. During these years is when the safety should be increased because this generation is not so much worried on things like that. As i said, it is a priority to be cautious about driving and the dangers of using any device.

CD23BE505EF1,"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Which shouldn't be allowed while driving because you could cause serious matters for you and everyone surrounding you. The reasons why cell phones should not be used while driving are fairly obvious, because even a two-second distraction taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example increases your risk of crashing. The feeling is that young drivers find it enough of a challenge to operate a car, and that any distractions are dangerous. The punishment you get for using a hand-held phone while driving is commensurate with how dangerous that behaviour. A part of the problem is people may answer an email or text they consider to be urgent while driving and because they don't have an accident, they think it's safe to do again. Ways to prevent this from happening; Put your phone away while driving. Putting your phone on mute or turning your phone off entirely is a sure-fire way you to avoid being distracted by it while you're driving. Have a conversation with people in your car or on the phone (even hands-free).To break these habits, people can either turn off their phone or put it on silent before driving. This will force them to concentrate on the road only. But if this method doesn't work on some people, you can use Siri to command your phone to read your messages or to reply back. Texting is a major factor when it comes to crashes and creating a hazardous situation, so preventing the usage of cell phones while driving would be a large step in limiting the number of crashes that happen in the United States.

As a young teen in America, I understand that using your phone while driving is very common nowadays. Although it is common, it's probably not the best decision to make. As technology improves, cell phone usage will continue to increase, especially in millennials. This does not mean that all cell phone usage is bad, but it does mean that everyone should reconsider using cell phones while driving. On a daily basis, I hear about people my age dying due to car accidents, because they chose to be on their cell phones while driving. Using your phone while driving can cause distractions, accidents, or put passengers and other drivers in danger.

While studying for my driver's test, I was overwhelmed by the seriousness of the laws about phone usage and driving. Phone usage while driving is against the law for several reasons. One reason why cell phone usage is against the law is because of the distractions that it can cause. We commonly see people using cellphones while driving every day, but it is illegal, Found on GHSA.org . Using cell phones while driving can cause distractions such as texting, or using social media. I strongly feel individuals should solely focus on driving when their car is in motion. When I started driving, I understood the importance of waiting to respond to any notifications that I receive, and putting my phone on do not disturb. I think that everyone should consider using this feature on their cell phones because it can potentially save their life or someone else's.

Furthermore, I think that driving while using your phone is not only dangerous, but it's also could be the reason for half of America's fatalities. It only takes seconds for someone to look down at their phone and cause a wreck. Cell phone usage itself is expanding, but I think that if people aren't considerate of their lives they should be considerate of others. For example, phone usage while driving could include snap chatting, taking selfies, searching for a song, or as simple as using your phone for directions. Phenomenally, phone usage has turned into a habit.

I've seen people use their phones while driving and it makes me question if they even care about their own lives. I think that risking someone else's life to check social media, respond to a message, or simply changing a song is ignorant. In today's society, phone usage has become a serious problem and I want to stress to millennials and my fellow peers, it can wait. Seeing people using their phones while driving not only bothers me, but it concerns me about the well being of my family. Phone usage while driving can cause car accidents, which can lead to a lifelong lesson. Whether the car accident results in a bad injury or death, it can change your life, forever.

Subsequently, as a teenager, I commonly see my friends posting videos while driving down the road with my other friends. Cell phone usage and driving are very illegal but most get away with it because they do it discreetly. I think that in today's time, everyone struggles with the concept of not ""texting and driving"". As mentioned before , my peers texting or making snapchat videos while driving, could cost them their lives. Mentioned on Healinglaw. com, there are stories teeneagers getting into wrecks because of the distractions of phone usage and their passengers distracting them. This careless act resulted in a bad wreck, which caused serious injuries. I often think to myself, ""why would one want to put someone else's life at risk, over a text?"" Something that I realized was that I cannot control my friend's actions, but I can control my own. I love my life enough to not risk it over a text message.

In conclusion, I think that even though phone usage while driving can be very tempting, it is not necessary. I think that phone usage while driving should continue to be illegal, I do not agree with putting someone's life at risk over a simple text or video. Putting your own life in danger or someone else's life in danger is a careless act that must be shunned upon. I also don't agree with the simple distractions that come along with phone usage and driving. Once one is behind the wheel, their phone should be on the do not disturb mode, and they should put their phones face down until they reach their destination. If a person has to use their GPS system while driving, it should be properly mounted in their car in concordance with all of the existing cell phone usage while driving laws. With that being said, I understand the concept of using a GPS while driving. However, I disagree with the concept of cell phone usage to text others and the use of social media platforms while driving. It can wait.

Many people follow the rules when driving and many people don't. There can be a lot of safety hazards when you are texting and operating a vehicle. Drivers need to be very careful when operating a vehicle because, they can put people's lives at risk. But, many people do not realize the safety concerns or that you should never use technology while driving.

Research shows that texting and driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk. It is extremely dangerous because people who do this are putting more attention in texting, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose the control of the vehicle, and could cause a crash or even in a worst case could kill other people.

While many people are pretty good a multi-tasking, on the road is not the place to put this skill in use. Texting and driving not only requires keeping your eyes on the road but also a combination of motor skills, not to mention that there is already enough going on with traffic so why add the additional distraction. Trying to do too many things at once confuses the brain and makes it difficult to focus on driving and reaction time. For example, imagine driving on a busy road. You are going 65 mph staring down on your lap, as soon as you look up you crash into a car and you kill the person you hit. It would be your fault and you would have to suffer the consequences all because you wanted to text and drive.

Researchers have come to prove that, Cell Phone Use While Driving Increases the Risk of an Accident. One out of 20 drivers use a cell phone when they're in the car, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA). However, doing so makes you four times more likely to get into an accident. Texting while driving is even worse.

In conclusion, texting and driving not only puts your life in danger but it also puts others life in danger. That's why when you drive your phone should be muted. Put aside all the distractions such as phones, loud music and headphones. Putting those things aside could prevent death while driving.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

One major impact on our society today is the usage of cell phones. So many people in the world today uses their cellular device on daily basis. Rather its usage is for an alarm clock, social media, or texting. People don't even like to have phone conversations anymore they just text that particular person they want to speak to their entire thoughts. Another major impact in today's society with these phones is driving and using them.

Typically teens from the age of 16 to the adult age of approximately 25 are affected by texting and driving. These people affected by texting and driving are mainly because people feel like once they phone rings they must immediately See who their being texted by, called by, or any notified from on social media.

The main focus on phones was to make contact with people over large distances. However, people are now using phones While their driving and that can create complications.

Calling or texting while on driving has become more of an issue since more are acquiring phones. The more phones come out the cheaper old ones are. That means more people are able to afford them which means a higher chance of a car crash (assuming they own a car).Some people own a car that has a bluetooth speaker that they can use to talk without having to put their hands on the phone. Of course this doesn't mean that a car crash is cant happen.

Cars with a built-in speaker should make driving easier but talking can still take focus away from the road. The road is one of the most important things for a driver (I'm not able to drive but I received help).Taking your eyes off it could very well end in the injury or death of several people.

Did you know that nearly 1.25 million people die from car crashes in a year? That means we lose more than 3287 people per day.

There aren't any laws that say that driving with a phone is illegal but getting into a crash can get many killed and it is also treated as a murder.

The level of danger related to the use of cell phones while driving is downright startling! The amount of distractions has drastically increased since the invention of cell phones. Not only do today's cell phones allow us to call, text, or chat at will, but they also give us access to hours of music and to interactive tools like GPS. Due to these capabilities, I believe that drivers should not be able to use their cell phones in any capacity.

Smartphones have always made it easy for us to stay connected, but that can pose serious safety risks if someone decides to check his/her text messages, emails, phone calls, or social media platforms while driving. A driver can travel the distance of a football field in the time that it takes for them to answer one text message!

Car radios have always been a distraction to drivers, but the new advancements in smartphones gives us hours of music at our fingertips. We now can not only use music apps like Pandora or Spotify but we also can download endless amounts of music onto our smartphones. We can even use YouTube to listen to music videos! All of this music browsing not only distracts us from driving, but the volume level can also impair us from hearing approaching emergency vehicles traveling at high speeds.

Gone are the days of looking at paper maps. Today's cell phones all offer GPS to help drivers navigate in unknown areas. While this feature is very convenient and helpful, it can also lead to distractions while driving. Constant checking of the map on the screen to check where you are going keeps your eyes off of the actual road in front of you.

Now with drivers using their phone while driving, it will leave detrimental pain to families that are struck with the news that their son or family member is now dead. So, phones should never be used while driving, because drivers die from being distracted from their phone on the passenger seat or middle console.

The World Wide Web is a social area where everyone can connect and communicate. But it will distract the mind just as a man to a very attractive female, and be only fixated on the one subject for as long as they could.

As you're driving; you're focused on one thing, that's on the road and your destination. But if you have your phone in the passenger seat or in the middle console, and you hear the notification ringtone, then your off task on what you need to focus on. You will lose all concentration, even if you keep looking back and forth on the road and the phone.

Cell phone use became widely available in the 1980's. The drastic improvements in functionality and design caused the use of cell phones to increase tremendously over the last two decades, for billions of people worldwide. The primary reasons why cell phone usage increased so dramatically over the past two decades are essentially because they make communicating much easier, they enable you to contact people within seconds or minutes, regardless of whether they are thousands of miles away, in another country or just a few feet away, you can locate and access places quickly and more conveniently, and they can provide security. As a result of the improved functionality and design allows cell phones to operate like computers. Its vast improvements have created a pandemonium because unlike before, people are able to easily connect with loved ones, friends, and even meet new people through social media. Downloading apps to cell phones offers endless opportunities for communicating whether by email, face-time, text messaging, also conversations, scheduling planning/diet planner, internet surfing, and alarms, etc, are just a few features that are available. While these mini devices have become a key part of our daily lives offering huge advantages, equally they can have their disadvantages especially, when being used while driving a vehicle. The compulsive use of them is a distraction, resulting in many road accidents that have ended with very serious casualties.

The prevalent use of cell phones has made the task become like second nature. While this may be true, being capable of using a cell phone so adeptly while driving a vehicle has not prevented drivers from losing their focus. Habitual use of the cell phone has diminished the responsibilities of a driver's who are supposed to constantly keep their eyes on the road, and their hands continuously on the steering wheel. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) approximately 660,000 drivers were using their phones while driving behind the wheel during the daytime all told, a full 14% of fatal distracted driving crashes involved a cell phone that was in use at the time of the wreck (""Deadly Distracted Driving Stats."" DMV.ORG, 28 Apr. 2017). The National Safety Council reports that an estimated 1.6 million crashes a year are because of utilization of cell phones while driving. Although, most drivers support the ban of hand-held cell phone use and texting, majority admit to still doing it anyway. According to a AAA poll, 94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving."" Edgar Snyder & Associates, n. d. Web. 12 Dec).

Georgia's new cell phone law, Hands-Free Driving, enacted Sunday, July 1st , 2018, was an imperative deterrent to reduce the number of fatal accidents, and loss of life for many innocent victims. Currently, forty-seven states have banned texting and driving, additionally, the 15 other states that have enacted the hands-free law, which requires drivers to use hands free technology, have seen fewer deaths and a 16 percent decrease in traffic fatalities in the two years after the law was enacted (""House Bill 673- Hands-Free Law""). Despite of the disadvantages or dangers of texting and driving, it does have a few advantages such as; navigation, provides help by making emergency contacts if in a dangerous situation and provides information about weather, traffic, or roadside accidents.

In conclusion, thousands of people are killed every day because of the distractions of these mini devices. This epidemic has become as serious as drinking under the influence. If drivers considered the risks and their responsibilities while being behind the wheel, they would adhere to the law by purchasing devices enabling them to be hands free when using a cell phone. Whatever text or phone call that pops up on the screen of their phones can wait. It's for the safety of you and most importantly others.

Today's world is such a dangerous place, especially on the roads. People have to be one hundred percent focused on the road to avoid accidents, sadly people have ignored the clear warning signs.

More than 1,500 people have died in car accidents in Georgia in 2016 alone. Texting while driving and other bad behaviors have increased in motor vehicle deaths in Georgia and across the nation over the past few years.

These deaths jumped by a third from 2014 to 2016 in Georgia.

As more people do it they become comfortable and trusting in the car, but sadly it's more than that. People are also addicted to phones, social media, and the constant search of ""making it"". They are yet to comprehend the seriousness of the situation. Operating a mobile device should not be allowed.

Phones are the main thing today that are causing problems in our society. They distract and hook people in. It has a great purpose but used improperly by most of us. As many studies show, we ARE distracted by them and should be prohibited to use while operating a vehicle. AT&T mademany advertisements that said ""It can wait"" referring to the use of phones.

Teens and young adults today love texting and being on technology. Technology is a great way to communicate with fellow friends and family. However, there are times where people should put phones down and focus to protect the safety of others. People should not use the phone while driving and on the job while working.

People should always have the phone put up while driving.

It is very dangerous and unsafe to text and drive. When it comes to texting and driving, teens are more likely to be found doing this. Every teen should have the phone away from them and should only use it when they are at a complete stop and parked.

People should not be driving distracted when other passengers lives are in their hands. When others are in the car, it is crucially important for the driver to focus and maintain their driving on the road. Passengers should also make sure they use their seat belt and make sure the driver is focused to ensure their own safety.

Teens are not the only ones texting and driving, young adults are just as worst. Young adults have jobs that call them while they are on the road, which causes a big distraction. Young adults and teens combined are a series of added wrecks and deaths. Deaths due to texting and driving continues to rise. The death toll could easily be lowered if people would just not text and drive.

There would be less deaths and car wrecks from distracted driving.

When it comes to texting and driving, it is a major issue for truck drives. Truck drivers are far worse than teens and adults in their cars. Most drivers wear headsets to communicate while on the road. Headsets are more safe for truck drivers to use instead of having their phone in hand and lose control of the wheel.

When drivers wreck, there are huge consequences. Passengers that are in the vehicle and others involved in the accident have the opportunity to sue or charge the driver. Drivers should always think of the consequences of what will happen if they pick up their phone, lose control, and wreck with people in the car. Drivers should also be off their technology even when they are alone riding safety is number one priority which is why phones should not be used driving.

Cell Phones are one of the essential items in many of peoples lives. We use them everywhere from looking up your favorite song, everyday news etc. but people are so used to them that they do not realize the dangers that come with it. In this article you will read about the dangers of phones and driving with them. We'll talk about overall what is distracted driving, the dangers that come with it and lastly why you should just put it down.

Did you know over a 1000 people a day are injuried from driving distracted by their phones, yeah not a lot of people either. Many people do not realize the real danger they face when they take their eyes of the road for just a second to change that song. It is a problem many drivers face even when they know its a problem. Many people have grown this into such a habit that it feels almost as second nature to them and don't realize in the moment what they're doing.

1 out of 4 people injuried in a car wreck are said to have been texting and driving. We don't realize how something can affect us before it is too late, whether you just swerve of the road a little bit or hit a tree you realize what you did in the end. When you get behind that wheel you are already putting yourself at risk many people do not realize that roads are one of the dangerous places to be, but when you decide it is time to change that song you put yourself at a significantly higher risk than before.

94% of drivers support banning texting and driving. Texting and driving is a problem everywhere and where they're are many people against it they're are still many people whom do not see a problem with it. When you pick up that phone you are not only putting yourself but others at risk too. I want you to ask yourself this is that sing important enough or that funny text from someone to risk your life over. Many people will say no but many people are hypocritical. You never believe something will happen to you until it does and when it does there is only one person you can blame.

You read about the affects and what using your phone while driving can do. Just take the advice from the many people who went through the affects of what this act can do because they know it better than anybody. Next time you get behind that wheel ask yourself, how risky to I want to be today?

Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. I personally think people should not use their phone and drink. Mobile phone use while driving is common, but it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and accidents. Distracted driving has become a dangerous practice on our streets and highways. Aside from the statistics of numbers of crashes, deaths and injuries, here are some graphics that can show you just what it is you're doing when you choose to text and drive, why it is so dangerous, and what can be done to prevent it.

When using your phone and driving at the same time it can be very dangerous to you, the passengers in the car and other drivers around you. Five seconds is the minimal amount of time your attention is taken away from the road when you're texting and driving.

If you're traveling at fifty-five mph, then that means you will drive the length of a football field without looking at the road.

A person is twenty-three times more likely to have a motor vehicle crash while sending a text message, than if they were only driving. That number towers over the other activities associated with distracted driving.

Most drivers think they can multitask by sending a quick message or reading a quick message. Seventy-one percent of teens and young people say they have composed or sent SMS messages while driving according to NHTSA.gov. Seventy-eight percent of teens and young adults say they have read an SMS message while driving according to NHTSA.gov. Text messages makes a car crash up to twenty-three times more likely to happen.

A big part of the problem is that people don't think it's a problem. Seventy-seven of young adults are very or somewhat confident that they can safety text while driving.

Fifty-five of young adult's drivers claim it's easy to text while driving. But it is a problem, teens and adults who text while driving spend approximately ten percent of their driving time outside of their lane.

Texting and driving or even using your phone while driving is very dangerous.

Despite the laws forbidding texting and driving, many people still feel as if they have the right to text and drive. However, I feel everyone has the responsibility to put the phone down and keep your eyes on the road and drive safely. I strongly agree that texting and driving is the most dangerous thing drivers can do on the road and people are injuring innocent people that could have been a very per cautious and they lose lives every day because of careless drivers. Texting and driving is one of the most dangerous things on the road today due to all of this technology, and they will not stop making this technology just because people are getting in accidents stop the text stop the wrecks. Take the pledge to stop texting and driving.                                                   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

I say we should not be allowed to use cell-phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Because according to today's research most accidents are caused by the use of cell-phones while driving. I honestly believe if more people stop using cell-phones while driving, it wouldn't be as many accidents as there is in today's society. After doing research it says "" drivers are at a four times greater risk of a crash"" and that is because of cell-phones. Also, when you are driving and using your phone it distracts from what's going on around you.

In the United States they have a law that if you are on your phone while driving you can get a ticket or furthermore get arrested.

Now that they have passed that law i rarely see people use their phones while driving. Over the past couple of decades the use of phones while driving was the main cause of accidents. ""Driver distraction, a sub-category of inattention, has been estimated to be a contributing factor in 8% to 13% of all crashes"". When people get into accidents its alot that can happen like injuries, the insurance companies, and other people may be in the car with them. Before we try to stop letting people use their phones while driving they say it's a lot of other things that distract drivers as well like eating, arguing, listening to music, and yelling at other drivers.

However, i believe most drivers use cell-phones may be having important calls from family, or co-workers saying they need you to fill in for them. I can personally say i've had personal experiences with someone using a cell-phone with me in the car. My grandma she was pulling in to my uncle's church and she was trying to call someone and she hit a block that was holding a stop sign and it messed up the front of her car. Another one is my mom she was driving and she was swerving in and out of lanes and she almost ran into a pickup truck. I have many more but im just praying that everyone leaves driving with phones in 2018 because i don't want any harm coming to me or anybody else i know.

In conclusion, we all as a community and globally we should restrict from using cell-phones while operating a vehicle. This year i don't plan on experiencing any vehicle accidents because of someone on their phone while driving. So i iree' miller say NO to phones while driving.

1D62536F6FD1,"Cell phones have become very popular over the past few years. New phones are coming out so more and more people are buying phones. Almost all people that operate a vehicle have a cell phone. Drivers should not operate a cell phone while driving.

Drivers should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. Because texting and driving can lead to bad accidents. According to research last year over one million accidents happened in the united states in 2018. Texting and driving is very distracting to drivers on the road. Many states have made this illegal but all states need to crack down on this so the accidents will go down in the future.

Texting and driving can also lead to death. The rate of death is very high for texting and driving every year it causes up to half a million deaths. The death rate is so high because people are careless about being on their phone while driving. They risk the chance of hurting others because of their bad habits.

Texting and driving is very dangerous because it leads to bad accidents and deaths. Drivers should stop doing it and police need to crack down on drivers that do it. If this happens accidents while driving would dramatically decrease and deaths would decrease. Texting and driving should stop, and we can make that change.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
AAFB0DA2ECA0,"In my very honest opinion, phones should not be allowed to use while driving. There are so many reasons why they shouldn't. There could be children in the car. Also, getting stopped by the police is everybody's worst dream. Lastly, it's not safe.

To begin with, texting and driving could be extremely dangerous when kids are in the car. First, while somebody is using their phone while driving, it could cause a big accident if they aren't paying attention to what's going on in front of them. There are more texting and driving accidents then drunk driving accidents. People mostly focus on their phone then focusing and staying behind the wheel not crashed into a tree.

Moreover, everyone knows getting stopped by the police isn't the best thing. The tickets cost a lot on money and sometimes is very hard to pay. Even some police may be harsh and might even take you in to court. Nobody wants to get stopped and pay for the price.

In addition, texting and driving is obviously not safe. Every year, at least 200,000 people experience accidents caused by texting while behind the wheel. The way the number keep increasing is honestly awful and so sad. I'm hoping that more in the future the number will decrease rather then increasing.

In conclusion, I have made my point that texting and driving is no where near acceptable. There is accident after accident each month & dealing with a loss is very sad. Not only can it affect whoever is in the car, but it can also affect those around.       ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Technology has taken the world to new heights in numerous ways. The invention of cars being able to take us places quicker than a horse proved that anything could happen. Mobile phones grew just as popular and took over the world with their unfathomable functions, designs, and capabilities. The way that people are so heavily into their phones and the problem with not having good drivers on the road or when those are combined make driving a combo that no one wants to see.

The usage of phones should not be allowed while driving by any means necessary. Phones divert people's focus and show that we are easily engrossed in them, being sidetracked is one of the things that are not needed on the road. The distractions of phones cause people to bump into things from household to public and it shows that staring at a phone is too much for most humans to multitask.

If a phone is needed for directions, then it should be set before driving or placed upon a stand of some sort on the dashboard of the car so that looking down for a long period of time does not lead to danger. In addition, texting can be held off and can be answered by simply pulling over to check rather than be a hazard on the road by taking either one or two hands off of the steering wheel.

Using a phone while driving has caused many to be severely injured or has led to the death of the driver, passengers, the people in the other vehicle, and/or unsuspecting pedestrians. There is no justifiable reason for someone to use their phone, the lives of few or many can be affected by someone's foolish actions. Others should not have to pay the price of someone else's actions by suffering from serious injuries, losing someone they love, or even worse their life.

In summary, the temptation to use a phone while driving should be taken away by turning the phone upside down or turning the phone off until the destination is reached, a music playlist should already be made in advance so that skipping an unwanted song does not happen. Commercials and ads should be increased and tell the consequences in a slightly harsher way and to get people to truly understand how much people value their life just as much as they do theirs. Phones should be needed to connect to cars to turn the phone off or through that way people tell of the message that is received. All in all, people should just stop using their phones while driving and should just think about others around them.

Phones and Driving

Modern society and cell phones, its an unbreakable bond, like a child to its mother's hip. There's a big problem with people using smartphones while behind the wheel of an automobile, and its causing wrecks, finder binders, people on the sides of the road to get hit from oncoming traffic, and people walking into the middle of the road while texting. Society has become more and more stuck to their screens. On a daily basis i see people swerve in and out of my lane on the road. Even when riding with my own friends, i constantly tell them to get off their phones, never do they listen.

The people of the world have lost the respect for vehicles that they used to have. We have become accustomed to using technology at all points of our lives. Wrecks happen everyday because someone couldn't wait to see who texted them back. Texting and driving has become a serious issue, with phones getting more and more involved in our lives it is apparent that action needs to be taken. When driving a motor vehicle of any type, a cellphone, tablet, apple watch, or ipod should in no way be able to be used. It puts the public peoples and themselves at risk of death or serious injury.

A law just came out in georgia that is a no hands law, you can not even have your phone in your lap, in your shoulder, definitely not in your hand, and nowhere near your face when driving a vehicle. I believe this should go in effect everywhere, and have some serious reinforcement from the police of society. Without someone to make people think before they act. That song you just couldn't wait to change, or that text that you just had to send, or that snapchat that you had to watch could be the very last thing you do. For the safety of you, and everyone around you please take action.

Driving is already dangerous enough as it is, but when you add people texting while there driving it adds a whole new level of danger. People should have their eyes on the road and not on their phone. By texting and driving they are putting themselves and everyone else on the road at risk. When people are driving they tend to focus on their phones instead of the road which can be a real threat to others.

Advancements in technology have helped drivers develop a less need for using their phones. Most cars made today are developed with technology to let drivers make phone calls or text without even looking away from the road or picking up their phone.

In this society phones have become a big part of our everyday lives. Many people use them when there eating, watching tv, while at work, and mainly when their driving. It's okay to use your phone in public and all but, when it comes to using your phone while driving it can cause major problems. It can cause accidents or ruin some one's life forever. This could haunt a person for a long time so, in my opinion people shouldn't drive and use their phones and this is my reason on why not to.

My reason is it's a major distraction for adults and mainly teens. An example would be texting and driving, this has caused many deaths for a lot of teens and ruined others' lives because of It. A reason why teens text and drive are they don't see the consequences for it. Another would be They are always in a hurry to give information and the last reason is Teen's nowadays are hook to their phones and don't have patience to wait. These are some reasons why teens text and drive and there should be a way to stop them from using it and I believe there's a way to prevent it.

One way to prevent this is by putting your phone out of reach this way you don't get distracted by the text messages and notifications that pop up. Another way is putting your phone on do not disturb this causes your messages to make a noise and don't show anything but only emergency calls. If your using your phone for GPS than its best to mount it on the dashboard. Last would be committed to not using your phone while driving and learn the consequences to it. If people knew the risk of using their phones while driving and how many people have lost their life to it, they would think twice in one article it talked about why not too and therefore and here's is why.

In this article written by Lauren Bennet named 10 fact of texting and driving she states the ""People who text while driving are 6 times more likely to get into an accident than those who drive while intoxicated"". This goes to show how its more dangerous than being intoxicated while driving. There's a lot more to this article like how 520 pedestrians are hit each year by a person using their phone or how 64% of accidents are from being distracted by a phone. A lot can be said about this article and there's a lot of problems that can be prevented and there actually is in some states there actually making it illegal to use your phones while driving. An example of one in Georgia.

In Georgia we are not allowed to text and there are no restrictions on handheld cell use for anyone else. In other places like Alabama teens that are 16 or 17 that have had their license less than a year are the only ones not allowed to use their phones. Another would be in Connecticut All handheld cell use and texting is banned. Each state is different, but this has caused a difference and has caused less crashes and should be in forced in many other places. This can make a changed and help teens grow to their fullest and enjoy their youth from one small mistake with a big consequence.

Majority of people use and own cellular devices which are used on a everyday basis. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating any vehicles. Using a phone is not safe for the driver or if applicable any passengers that are in the vehicle.

While driving a cell phone is a distraction. When operating a motor vehicle your full attention needs to be in the vehicles , the surrounding of the vehicle, and the road ahead. A cell phone is an immediate distraction to a driver because their focus shifts. If a driver receives a text and is able to read it their attention and eyes are now at their phone an not on the road which can cause a accident involving another vehicle with passengers in it or simply an accident with them and the passengers they have with them.

If people are able to use phones while driving it would increase the accident rates , slow down traffic , and cause more deaths and injury's. Driving requires your full attention and awareness. You need to always be aware when your driving and if your focus is on your phone your now not focused on the road.

Using your phone while driving not only is putting everybody on the roads life at risk but yours to. The accident would put you At-Fault whether you get injuries or not and therefore it would be a lot of damages you would have to pay for , especially if you were in a wreck with another vehicle or possibly multiple vehicles.

Having phones while driving isn't safe for the driver , passengers or any other moving vehicles on the roads. Using phones while driving is dangerous and should be illegal and people that take action in this crime should be strictly punished.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
8669449C3779,"Do you believe that drivers should be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. I think that drivers should not be allowed to operate a cellular device while driving a vehicle. Using a cellphone while driving can cause a series of accidents and drivers wouldn't have their full attention on the road. The roads would be more safe, if drivers don't use cellphones while driving.

Most tragic car accidents are nearly caused by drivers using their cellphones. Studies show that fatal car accidents by teen drivers comes from them being distracted by their ""phones"". This is a very high percentage , considering that there are also adults that rarely text and drive then get into an accident. If we are to be more descriptive, ""In 2017, 15,341 drivers aged 15-29 were involved in fatal crashes due to distraction or cell phone use."" The more that young adults aren't exposed to the rights and wrongs of texting and driving, that percentage will rise. This is a serious risk factor, that could be elevated to the percentage that will cause the limits on cars to rise.

Another con when it comes to cellphone use while driving is the excessive use of ""iphone holders"". It may seem harmless, but in all reality, it can cause young adults, even adults and elders, to be at risk of an accident. What happens is that although the phone holder is put in place for people to see and interact with their phones without taking their eyes off the road, it is still seen as a temptation. For example, if an 18 year old is about to drive at a party, and is receiving multiple messages., while her phone holder is in place constantly seeing the message pop up, could lead to anticipation, and a risk, that could've been avoided. There are many ways that driving can be safe, without heading your phone!

Since I stand for less cellphone usage while driving, here are some of my personal tips that may help prevent not only young adults, but everyone from risking their lives. There is now built-in technology that can pick up your voice, activate GPS, and even reply to messages; It's called siri ! Siri is an apple product that is built within the Iphone.

In conclusion, this is why I believe texting and driving is not safe for anyone. We could save more lives if we put everything down. With this type of technology, it would make it easier to access things while you are on the road, and will, in the long run, will decrease the risk of accidents.

In conclusion, this is why I stand for young adults, even adults alone, should not use their cellular devices while driving. We shouldn't have to put our lives at risk for one simple text.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

I believe that people shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any kind of capacity while driving because not only is it bad but, it's also dangerous for you and whoever else is in the car with you.

Transporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, on that many young drivers take lightly. Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers' lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle. Could you live with the knowledge that your decision to pick up your phone while operating a vehicle caused someone to suffer a life-altering injury or be killed.

Many brands of new cars are equipped with technology that connects your cell phone to your vehicle's stereo system. If you drive an older model vehicle, invest in a cell phone with Bluetooth technology and voice recognition technology that will allow you to send and receive messages hands-free. The reason why I am saying this is because if you could speak to your phone to do things it would be easier for you to drive on the road.

Everyone already knows how bad it is to text and drive and that it can cause accidents, but I never told you how many there has been. In 2011, 1.3 million automobile accidents were caused by texting and driving. Texting and driving make you twenty-three percent more likely to be involved in an accident.

After all the bad things that can happen, I believe that nobody should be allowed to use cell phones while doing any operating in a vehicle. Also, in 2015, 3,477 people were killed, and 391,000 were injured in crashes involving distracted drivers using cell phones on U.S. roads. The bottom line is that texting and driving is seriously dangerous so put the down the phone. Keep your eyes on the road and stay safe.             ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Drivers should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. Because it is dangerous for other drivers and it put their life in jeopardy. It's a proven known fact that most wrecks happen because the driver not looking at the rode. And if you're looking down at your phone texting it's no way you're looking at the rode, an that's serious because you could put your life in danger. So just put your phone up and be safe.

But if you have a bluetooth device it's all good because your still paying attention to the rode. But if you're not a skilled driver or been driving for a long time its your best bet not to even use a bluetooth device, because you could be in a conversation on the phone an lose focus.

Reports have that 1.6 million crashes are caused because drivers text while driving and they don't wear a seat belt. So put those phone s down an put your seat belt on and drive safe.                    ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

With the popularity of mobile devices rising year after year many cellphone users attempt to use their devices while driving. As a result of this there are 1.6 million cell phone use related car accidents each year. Making a call, sending a text, or skipping a song is never worth putting someones life in danger. It is simply too dangerous for a multitude of reasons and never should be done. If drivers were able to do this the roads would never be safe.

Cell Phones are extremely distracting whether your doing your homework, watching tv, and especially while operating a motor vehicle. Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field. Hundreds of thousands of injuries occur each year as a result of distracted driving. To stop this problem we have to do more than just bring awareness to the issue, we have to steps legally to protect teen drivers as well as adults.

Teens are most at risk for distracted driving related accidents. 21 percent of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were distracted by their cell phones. Also with only one other person in the car teen drivers are twice as likely to get into a fatal car crash. This is due to the fact that teens use cell phones more than adults and are also more easily distracted. Most drivers are aware of the fact that texting and driving is very dangerous but continue to do so anyway. The desire to want to stay connected at all times is too great for us citizens to restrict ourselves. So we have to put laws in place to restrict cell phone usage while driving. Some states already have laws prohibiting holding your cell phone in your hand while you drive. We need these laws every where or we will continue to lose loved ones to car accidents that could have been avoided if the drivers weren't using their cell phones.

Phones and driving have been around or influenced in our society for a very long time. Fatal injuries of friends, families, or even fellow class mates have been a victim to this incident. We have the option to say no more! Why wouldn't the state governments all throughout the U.S. want to induce a law such as this in each state? For certain we could create a major decrease in the percentages of car crashes for our citizens. Think of when you are walking, you don't stare into your phone because you will bump into other people walking, so why would you do that while driving? Therefore, phones and driving should be banned due to poor results and statistics.

There are roughly about more than one hundred thousand people who are involved with phones while driving. For example, Mississippi has banned texting and driving, but has yet to ban holding the phone in their hand while driving. Now think to yourself, what are the chances of someone responding to a hilarious text from their friend? Deep down I believe anyone's answer would be a high chance. The moment you take focus off the road even if it's for half of a second, you increase your chance of being able to miss something causing you to make a horrible judgment call on the road. A quarter percent of car crashes is due to the usage of a cellphone. We should have the encouragement to change that quarter into a penny or no chance at all!

How much do you value your life? Even if your answer to that is ""Not much at all."", what about someone you cherish and that cherishes you? People tend to do more for others over themselves. Also, passengers of your vehicle aren't the only ones that you are accountable for. That's right; think of the pedestrians who tend to use their feet as transportation. You have a high chance of endangering them if you take your focus from the road and onto your phone. Even if no one matters to you and all that's in value to you is money, you're still in for a rude awakening. If you think insurance is a burden to you and your financial life right now just think about how a citation for texting and driving will affect you. Think about your life and how multiple areas of it can potentially be affected by a poor action to use your phone while driving.

What most people don't know is that the mind is trained to do one thing at a time in the result of having controlled and efficient focus. Imagine how the usage of a phone can take your mind from what is in front of you on the road. You mentally must be in a good state to perform safe driving. Teen drivers can be affected by this heavily. Due to a little amount of experience of driving. One more thing that can affect their driving is social media and how it is excessively used in today's generation. Last thing parent's want is a phone call stating that their kid has been in a car accident. We could simply all agree on this.

In conclusion, phones and driving should be banned due to poor results and statistics as we stated above. We have a huge percentage of human beings that are affected by this distraction. We need to take away the cause, so the effect ceases. High values are at a major risk if you make the mistake to use your phone while driving. So, the next time you drive, take your values into consideration. You need to take full control of your focus and create a great, determined, and powerful state while driving. Don't get caught up in this distraction, it isn't urgent while you are driving, get to your destination safely first!   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

For example, what if someone crashes and kills one of your family member just because they were on their phones or you crash into someone because you were on your phone you would feel bad for the person you crash and the reason was for being on your phone you might end just getting arrested. This shows, that no matter whenever you are driving you should keep your eyes on the road something can easy cause a accident so fast. This is important because, now they have made a new aw about if a police sees you with a phone on your hand while driving you will get ticket or get arrested just to prevent an accident.

I believe that drivers should not use their phones while operating a vehicle. Everyday people are dying in car accidents because they're using their phones while driving. Many people today believe that cell phones are one of the most leading factors in car accidents. Despite the fact that they're putting themselves in danger, people still use their phone while driving because they don't want to miss anything and to contact others. Are people's texting conversations that important, that they risk crashing their car, or putting not only your life but the life of other people at risk.

Not only is texting or talking behind the wheel bad enough, but many people compare this to drinking and driving as well. Drunk driving is another leading factor in car accidents everyday. These two things are closely related to each other because of how many injuries or deaths they both have caused. Some say that texting while driving is even more dangerous than drunk driving, but people still don't realize the danger of it.

Many people argue that having a bluetooth will make it easier for them to stay on the phone while staying focused on the road while driving. they also say that it's more useful to them. But that can also distract them from the road as well, they could be in a very important conversation that can cause them to lose focus of what they're doing and they could end up in a bad car wreck. If the phone call or text is that important, than they should take time to pull over into a parking lot so they can answer it instead of trying to answer it in the car. Most people believe that staying connected to the outside world is more important than focusing on the road but it really isn't.

And even though there are laws that ban the use of cell phones while driving it hasn't stopped the amount of car crashes every day. The government can put a law to ban the use of phones while in the car, but they can't stop People from using it because it's not as easy for police to see when people are on their phones as it is for them to determine how fast you are going or headlights are off. People just don't see the use in banning phones and don't follow them.

I personally feel like people should stop using their phones as well and stay focused. If people truly want to stay safe then there are plenty of ways of doing this like putting their phones on silent and not on vibrate. They can also turn their phones completely off. And if they can do that it will at least lessen all the crashes. When you're behind the wheel, you should never have your attention on your cell phone. It's important to be alert at all times. You should always keep your eyes on the road.

In some ways, the reason people get drunk and drive are similar to the people who text and drive.

Distracted Driving The Center for Disease Control (CDC) points out that there are three types of distraction we are susceptible to while driving. They are visual, manual, and cognitive. Visual distractions consist of anything that pulls your eyes away from focusing on the road. Manual distractions happen when you remove a hand or both hands from the steering wheel Cognitive distractions involve things that draw your mind away from the road and makes you lose focus.

All this can be stopped but many people don't really care enough for that, even if there has been a law passed they still will keep texting and driving.

The people that text and drive are mostly teens, they never seem to put their phones down. Many teens have died from texting while driving, but that will never put an effect to the teens. You can tell a teen to stop texting and driving but they will never listen, they will keep doing it till they end up in an accident. About 1,300,000 are killed by car accidents, most of them are caused by distracted drivers. Many people do get killed by the accident but many are left disabled, meaning they won't be able to walk for years, but they are also left with the memory of them getting ran over. So many people nowadays stay on their phone, a text can wait. If you're are a traffic light, that text can wait till you're at your destination. Yes, there are many impatient people,but they should understand there are many people dying by one simple text, or a simple call.

Many people can deny that they wasn't texting and driving but little they know that there is a camera at every traffic light now. Georgia passed a law about using their phone while driving, it caused more police to be out on the roads, protecting and watching who is using their phones.

Teens are the main ones that use their phones while driving to show off they have a car or to show off they can drive.

Drivers shouldnt be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle because of a list of reasons, they could easily be distracted and cause a wreck which could lead to serious injuries or even in worst cases cause death. Drivers now have the technology to have bluetooth devices which should be put to use.

Drivers shouldnt be able to use cellphones while driving a vehicle because it could cause them to be distracted and they could cause serious injuries to other people who they are sharing the road with , whether there is a bicyclist , pedestrians walking, or most of the time other drivers . This is just one of many reasons why drivers shouldnt be able to use their cellphones while operating vehicles. Safety is a huge factor in this discussion because the road should be a person's primary focus while operating a vehicle in order to keep everyone in the vehicle safe.

Secondly, drivers shouldnt be able to use cellphones because they would risk getting pulled over by the police which could lead to tickets and having to pay money, for some depending on their background could be locked up. All of these possible outcomes could be avoided if drivers were not allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle .

Ways to prevent drivers from having to use their cellphones would be to make vehicle bluetooth devices affordable for everyone who owns a vehicle. That way they wouldn't have to physically touch or be on their phone while operating a vehicle. Instead they could just get everything set up before they start driving and talk into their phone, instead of picking it up to answer a call or text, which could cause them to be distracted while driving.

In conclusion drivers should not be able to use cellphones because they would be putting not only themselves in danger but others who they share the road with. They should also not be able to use cellphones to avoid getting pulled over to avoid the consequences that may come with that.

Driving is very convenient in this time and age. Not only is driving convenient but also a prominent way of transportation everywhere. Driving has many good effects on society today but can be dangerous and in many ways even fatal. Something that has a big effect on driving is the smartphone people keep with them every day all day. Texting and driving has been consistently taking the lives of drivers behind the wheel. Texting and driving should not be allowed in this time in age nor in the future.

Texting and driving comes with the ultimate risk being a life. Many people, teens especially, are losing their lives in car accidents. The cause of these car accidents could be avoided if these people were not texting while driving. The text states ""...the number of auto fatalities has remained stable, at about 40,000 deaths a year. The US Department of Transportation estimates that 6,000 of those are the result of distracted driving."" The textual evidence shows that phones and driving can be a large factor in deaths while driving. The most important part is how the phones are killing off these people.

When texting and driving is occurring at the same time it forces the driver to multitask. Some evidence states ""Driving and cell phone conversations both require a great deal of thought. When doing them at the same time, your brain is unable to do either well."" Multitasking is already hard on people and then their attention span makes texting and driving an even worse idea. In the text it states ""According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information, at the U.S. National Library of Medicine, the average attention span of a human being has dropped from 12 seconds in 2000 to 8 seconds in 2013"". This evidence shows that humans already have a short attention span, so imagine a younger person with a weaker mind texting and driving.

The texting while driving epidemic has its biggest effect on the younger people. The youths are more likely to have and be using a smartphone while driving than elders. This is supported by the claim ""Younger age groups are also much more likely to use social media sites like Facebook than older ones."" This shows that youths are more likely to be affected by the epidemic of texting and driving. In the text it also states ""In every country surveyed, those under 35 are more likely to own smartphones, to use the internet and to use social media than those ages 50 and older."" Smart phones have more of an influence on younger people as seen in the text.

Texting and driving is something that would not benefit anyone if it were allowed. Not only should texting and driving not be allowed but it should be outlawed. This epidemic has already claimed the lives of so many people. People all over the world are losing their lives and sustaining permanent injuries from texting and driving. This needs to be stopped permanently by being outlawed and kept out of mind.

Reason two is it costs you money in the long run. Everybody knows it's against the law to use a cell phone while operating a motored vehicle. You can easily get a ticket and have to go to court.

Phones should be used for that purpose and that purpose only there's no need to be updated with social media 24/7 when you could simple wait when your home. Would you rather check a tweet and run someone over on accident towards your destination or drive safely towards your destination without hitting a thing. All it takes is for everyone to ignore the rings and buzzes of their phone.   ",2,Phones and driving,Independent,0.2

Cell phone use while driving is one of those hot button issues at the moment. Everyone has a cellphone. When it goes off while they are driving weather it is a message , social media or a phone call, curiosity seems to get the best of them as they feel as if they have to look now. Using cellphones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It does not matter how good you are at multitasking, it should be forbidden and against the law entirely. Here are just a few reasons for that.

One reason why cellphones while driving should be banned is let's start with texts social media and any other written phone alert. To stop and read this message or update you would have to take your eyes off of the road for longer than the recommended time of the one second, it takes to check the rear view mirror. It is extremely dangerous to type or read while driving. It is a hazard to everyone on the road, so it is not just your own life you are risking.

As for making phone calls, this too should be banned. I do understand that sometimes your spouse may call needing you to stop somewhere on the way home or you think it may be an emergency. If that is the case, pull over to the side of the road, take the call and then retire driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason to pick up your phone while driving your car.

Even hands-free devices that allow us to talk on the phone while driving with both hands on the wheel are still a hazard. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a; lot of its energy into the conversation. This means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction.

Whatever it is can almost always wait until you get where you are going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be as convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many teenage lives to Tweets or texts if they know their license could be taken if they do look.

Crashes, getting pulled over, and not paying attention to the road- nobody likes those things, well, most of it comes from cellphones. Operating cellphones on the road is not good for you.

Crashes are one of the main causes of death today. The Zebra states that ""Nearly nine people die and 1,000 are injured from car accidents daily where one is distracted by a phone."" This implies that most accidents are caused by someone operating cellphones on the road, which shows you how much people stay on their phone in the car and why it is not good for you. In summary of this paragraph driving while on the phone is not good for you.

Getting pulled over by the cops because of being on your phone while driving happens a lot. While people are in real situations you are getting pulled over by a cop because of a cellphone. The Seattle Times said that ""Individuals are getting fined $136 for a first ticket and

$234 for additional tickets."" This shows that if you get pulled over for being on your phone you will be fined for it. In other words it is another example why not to be on your phone while driving.

Not paying attention to the road is mainly caused by a cellphone. Most people when on phones in a car are not paying attention to the road which means they could hit someone or something, hit another car, or run off the road. On Wikipedia they say that ""Drivers are distracted, decreasing the drivers awareness on the road."" This confirms that driving and using a phone causes people to not pay attention to the road. Therefore, operating cellphones on the road is not good for you.

In conclusion to this essay, I explain how driving and operating a phone is not good for you. You could also help by turning off or silencing your phone when you enter the car and drive safely. It could lead to less crashes, less tickets, and a safer drive.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

There are and still today many accidents created on the road, highways, or even in big cities. People who have been texting while driving has a high risks of getting in a huge accident and can have you pay a fine of 20 upto 400 dollars. In georgia is $150 if a cop catches you with your phone while driving. There are some states that texting and driving is illegal.

You already seen that the cells phones today are more advanced smart, fancy, and quick with better technology than before. From black to metallic white with glass back wireless charging where anybody can afford them and they're going to be more use around here even driving because everyone wants to try the new phone which is a big distraction. Many people loses focus on the road and that's when accidents happen even though many people who gets their license, they still dont respect the rules of driving and especially texting and driving.

Many opponents would say cellphones are needed for just in case of emergencies but what if your in a accident and you are stuck and the phone is kinda far you cant grab it why because you stuck and cellphones aren't reliable though. So if people don't give up cell phones then the number of fatalities will increase. Its people's responsibilities to not include their lives and others.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

In 2018 the reported number of deaths due to cell phone and electronic device use was 4,637 people. Distracted driving is anything that takes your attention away from driving is anything that takes your attention away from driving. Sending a text message,using your GPS or talking on a cell phone is considered as distracted driving .For this very reason sum states have looked into coming up with a way to prevent drivers from being distracted.

According to the new law that was passed on May 2,2018 anyone driving in the state of Georgia is to abide by the ""No Hands Law"". With this law being in effect,this means any and every person behind the wheel shall not have a phone in their hand or have it touching any part of their body while behind the wheel. If you are caught with the phone in your hand the penalties wi be for your First offense will be a $50.00 fine , Second offense will be a $100.00 fine, and the Third offense is at

$150.00 fine. Points will also be added to your drivers record. Once you accumulate too many points within a certain period of time your license will be suspended or revoked. In addition your insurance premium will increase.

In essence my belief is that drivers should not be able to have a electronic device in their possession,while behind the wheel. The reason I believe this is because there are entirely too many deaths because of distracted drivers. Taking your attention from the role may harm or kill a person. Distracted driving may also cause devastation for family. It may also put a financial burden on families which can affect them mentally as well as physically.

Could you imagine what would happen if people just put down their phones? Can you imagine how many people's lives will be saved? All it takes is for you to put our phone down while driving .You are not only jeopardizing your life but the lives of others citizens as well. The very few seconds that are taken for reading a text message can be the very seconds that can take or harm a life.

There is no other feeling worse than taking the life of someone else's family member. Having to watch that family grieve and bury their loved ones can hunt you for the rest of your life. As responsible drivers remember we are not only driving for ourselves but others as well. Let's all step up and pledge today to participate in the no hands law. This will automatically lead to less accidents and safer driving.                 ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Drivers should not drive and use a cellular device because their holding up traffic and putting people's lives in danger from not paying attention to the road. It's safer to get a phone mount for your car so that you won't have to hold the device and keep your hands on the wheel. If your driving on a road, I advice if you only use your phone for navigation and music and stay off social media until you are parked or at your destination. Scrolling through the internet or social media is not worth losing your life or anyone else's life, or damaging you or someone else's vehicle. Therefore, 660,000 drivers are attempting to use their device behind the wheel of an automobile. I think it's best drivers keep their phone out of their hands while driving because its so many people on the road today and your risking you and all their lives because you wanted to be on your phone and not keep your eyes on the road. Just 5 seconds your eyes can be off the road and you'll hit someone. It doesn't take long for your car to take control of what way it goes when you aren't paying attention.

Its important to watch what your doing and pay attention to your surroundings, to your children or upcoming drivers thatll be on the road and teach them the right things to do on the road and what to do when something goes wrong.

Texting while driving has become very common in today's society. With all the many Apple and Android products out right now and all the new technology it makes us more engaged into our phones, such as quick reply. Although features like that makes it easier for people to communicate in a time consuming way, it is very obvious that it takes the attention of the driver which could lead them to vehicle involved accidents.

It is never a good idea to be on your phone and drive. It causes major distractions for drivers. According to ""The National Safety Council"" cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. (Edgar Snyder, 2019). Given this information and other cited sources, it is safe to say that a single text could lead to a tragic accident in a matter of seconds. Drivers should be alert and always pay attention to the road.

Not only is being on your phone while driving dangerous, it is also illegal.

Nowadays some people do not like to talk on the cell phone but instead send text messages or self-gratification such as pictures and videos while driving. Texting and driving have been a leading cause of car crashes, bodily injury, and even deaths. The reasons why people should not use cell phones while driving is because you are not in control or fully focused and you are more likely to get in a car crash and most likely be at fault for it.

Statistics show ""Texting while driving is more of a problem now than ever, as 69 percent of

It is a habit that must be stopped, across age groups and geographic locations alike. It only takes three seconds for a crash to occur after a driver becomes distracted by their cell phone or any other device. ""While 26 percent of all motor vehicle crashes are related to the use of cell phones. Each day the average of 11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving.""

The solutions to preventing the mishaps from texting and driving. For example, do not use the phone for talking, texting, and social media while driving. You can turn your phone on silent or just turn it off so you can avoid getting any notifications or distractions. If you are with a passenger or more, if it is needed let them send the message for you or check the notifications instead of putting everybody and yourself at risk for something that can wait. If it is urgent you can even pull over and check it if there is no risk of dangers. If you are a licensed driver you are expected to obey the laws on cell phone usage and operating a vehicle.

These are the reasons why cell phone usage should be prohibited while driving. It is simply not worth it, you can also be arrested and fined. Also, you can cause hurt and heart ache between family and friends and it can weigh heavily on your conscience financially and mentally. This is one area my parents constantly talk about when teaching me how to drive. I can agree it is a distraction to many teenagers but one story my mom shared with me about a young girl getting killed while texting will always be in my subconscious. I have decided life is more important than a moment of inference while driving.

What would happen if you were allowed to use a phone while driving? In 2012, 3,328 people were killed in distraction related accidents, while 421,000 people were injured in the same accidents in America. Texting or talking to someone while driving is illegal for a reason. A text or call is not worth others wellbeing. Phones and other devices should not be used while operating any type of vehicle on the road because it will increase your chances of hurting someone or yourself.

To start, operating a vehicle while using a cellular device can increase your risk of crashing. While people focus on their phones, it's impossible to focus 100% of attention on the road. Due to that, more accidents happen. Insurance will increase if they find out someone has been driving while distracted on their phone. A result of a car crash usually results in someone being hurt. Sometimes people even die from these same car accidents!

Of course, killing someone on accident isn't ideal. Is someone's life or family really worth risking over a text or call? It doesn't take much for a car crash to happen, so if someone is distracted by a phone, it is much more likely to happen. In 2014, cell phone usage caused 24% of car accidents. It may not sound like much, but that is a large percentage of people that were involved in a car accident in 2014. There were 6,064,000 accidents in 2014, and 24% of that is 1,455,360. Using the same source, around 35,000 of those 1,455,360 were deaths. That is not the only thing you are risking, however.

In addition to putting others lives in danger, you are putting yourself at a great risk as well. Those same statistics are not exclusive to the others you affect. It affects you as well. A simple text or phone call could throw you off and quickly end your life. It's just as simple as glancing at a text message. Anything around you at that moment, can harm and potentially kill you.

To conclude, using a cell phone while operating a vehicle is illegal for a reason. When someone chooses to text and drive (or call and drive), they are putting a families life at risk, as well as themselves. Even if no one is hurt or dies, there is still the car accident they have to deal with. Cost and insurance will be a nightmare for them.

For example in the state of Georgia cell phones are prohibited. The consequences of using your phone while driving would be a fine of 50 dollars as well a 1 point assessed against the drivers license.

Other reasons why being on the phone while driving is bad is because it is distracting and there is a high risk of car crashes.

There is also a high chance to be at fault for an accident if there was ever one to occur.

These are all reasons why I believe drivers shouldn't be allowed to use their cell phones while using or operating a vehicle.         ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

In recent years most younger and some older drivers use their own mobile phone a lot of the time, and some of that time includes when they are in the middle of driving. Should drivers not be able to or should they be able to use their phones while operating a car or any other vehicle? Well, going by the number of deaths caused by this every year, it is most certainly should NOT be allowed or even legal (which, in this case it already IS NOT legal).

Using a telephone whereas driving creates monumental potential for deaths and injuries on U.S. roads. In 2017 alone, 3,166 folks were killed in motorcar crashes involving distracted drivers. A report, ""Teen Distracted Driver Data"" by the NHTSA. Showed the following results:

? According to a AAA poll, 94 percent of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway.

? 21 percent of teen drivers involved in fatal accidents were distracted by their cell phones.

? Teen drivers are 4x more likely than adults to get into car crashes or near-crashes when talking or texting on a cell phone.

? A teen driver with only one additional passenger doubles the risk of getting into a fatal car accident. With two or more passengers, they are 5x as likely.

The numbers of teens dying per year shows and further supports the laws placed on using a mobile cell phone device, while operating a vehicle.

A poll done by ""The Zebra"" in 2019 on the general statistics of people using a mobile cell phone device while behind the wheel of a car:

? The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year.

? Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving.

? 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.

? Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk.

? Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field.

? Texting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road.

? Of all cell phone related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity.

? 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving.

? 74 percent of drivers support a ban on hand-held cell phone use.

Based on the results of the poll, and linking the results of this, with the results of the list on teens using mobile devices behind a wheel results. It shows that the problem does not just occur in teens, but in more grown people too, which, shows the real seriousness of the situation and how much we really DO need the laws already in place against using phones while behind the wheel of a car.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the laws placed against using a phone behind the wheel of a car, are to protect those in the car with the driver, and the driver themselves from a possible fatal collision with other cars on the road. And in actuality we really need STRICTER laws on the matter as a whole, for it really is a serious, fatal matter that needs more attention.

For example, using your phone while operating a vehicle. Drivers should not be able to use Cell Phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Majority involve drivers distracted while talking on handheld or hands free Cell Phones. Majority involve drivers distracted while talking on handheld or hands free cellphones. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 27% of car crashes in 2013 were caused by cell phone use. Cell Phones use and hands free illegal in schools or highway work zones, However, California, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Jersey, and Georgia etc. Prohibit all drivers from using hand held cell phones while driving. Cell phones have become a grave concern and a major cause of road accidents. That's why I say no Cell Phones should be used while operating a motor vehicle at any time. It would prevent less car accidents from cell phone use.

In 2015, 42% of high school students reported frequent texting while driving were less likely to wear a seat belt, more likely to ride with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, and more likely to drink and drive. Parents should avoid calling their teens when he or she is driving. A teen may feel compelled to answer a parent's call if received while driving. A federal transportation funding law passed in July 2012, known as the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act. This is the kind of concrete information that can arm the people trying to combat distracted driving and it's a heated battle. The hand held law is necessary and important, but if it is not combined with warnings about the dangers of hand free calls, then it may inadvertently promote an almost equally distracting and dangerous behavior. So if you think tempted to make or take a hands free call, think again. It could kill.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

No drivers should be able to have a phone while driving, there are many reasons to why drivers shouldn't have cell phones while driving. Drivers tend to be distracted while on there cell phones and it can lead car crashes, death, serious injuries to you or the others person you injured while you were on your cellphone. Causing an accident while driving with distractions you will be charged with manslaughter and will serve jail time for eight years under federal law.

Phones shouldn't be allowed not only because of car accidents but it can also cause insurances to rise and making many people spend more money for insurance because people are distracted with there cellphones and not paying attention to the road. Car crashes can cause many accidents not just one but multiple all at one time, someone can loose there life in a second without blinking all because you got distracted and wanted to get one last text message, that one last text message could be you ending someone's life even your own.

F5D85379A614,"Over the last two decades, cell phones have become very popular. Today, almost everyone has a cell phone, especially if they are old enough to drive. Cell phone use while driving has become a big controversy over the last few years and many people have faced the consequences of texting, calling, or searching their cell phones while operating a vehicle. With that being said, there are several reasons why people should not use their phones while driving. These reasons can be classified into a couple of different categories, including safety and legal reasons.

The first reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in injury or death for the driver or someone else. This could pose a safety hazard and would therefore fall under the safety category. Statistically, there are 1.6 million car crashes that are caused by texting and driving each year. Almost 390,000 injuries each year from accidents involve a cell phone or other device. Also, 1 out of every 4 car accidents are caused by texting and driving in the U.S. Therefore, there is always a risk that an accident will happen as a result of cell phone use and could harm anyone involved in the accident.

The second reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it can result in property damage for the driver or someone else, which could pose a safety hazard but could also result in someone pressing charges. Therefore, this could be classified under the safety category and the legal category. As mentioned above, crashes due to cell phone use while driving are very common in the United States. It can cause damage to other vehicles, houses, and or company buildings. Whatever your insurance doesn't cover you have to pay out of pocket and these damages can get really expensive. Any insurance claim could also cause your monthly payments to go up.

The last reason to not use a cell phone while driving is that it is against the law in many states such as Georgia, which would fall under the legal category. On July 1, 2018, Georgia passed a Hands-Free law that basically says that anyone driving a motor vehicle on a highway in Georgia is not allowed to hold a phone with any part of their bodies. A first-time offense for using a cell phone and driving is $50, the second is $100, and the third is $150. Each offense after the third one is also $150 each. Every offense is a misdemeanor that would go on your permanent record.

There are multiple reasons why you should not use your phone while driving. This distracted driving can lead to car wrecks that could cause harm to you, to someone in your car, or to anyone else involved in the accident. An accident could also cause damage to your car, to someone else's car, or to homes, buildings, and other property damage. It is also illegal in many other states so if you are caught you could be fined up to $150 and it would go on your permanent record. Because of these potential safety hazards and legal issues, it is best to not use a cell phone while driving a vehicle.   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8
C7DE89890089,"Should people be able to drive a vehicle and use a cell phone yes or no ?

Today in Atlanta a lot of car accidents happen due to people being on their phones instead of driving. So therefore I say no people should not be able to use their phones while operating an vehicle. One little text is not worth your life or someone else's life !

I think that an law should be passed so that people won't use they phone and if caught using their phones they get a ticket. Of course people don't want to have to pay a fine so they would obey the law. Making this law would keep a lot of car accidents from happening here in atlanta. When on the expressway down here all you see is people on their phone making videos and then boom they hit another car all because they wasn't paying attention to the road.

Another reason I say that you should've be able to use cell phones and drive is because you need both hands to keep control over the wheel. Turning with one hand is hard to do. I actually witness someone have a phone in one and driving with the other one swerve off the road because she couldn't properly control the wheel with one hand. Which had me thinking is being on a phone while driving really worth your life or someone else or even just having to pay extra money to get your car or someone's else fixed all because of a mistake that could've been prevented !

With that being stated please help us get a law to keep people off their phones ! I wouldn't want anything to happen to no one family or mines all because of someone wanting to send a text or make a nice video driving ! It is not worth going to jail for killing or hurting someone or being sued ! Please keep in mind when driving your not just driving for your self your driving for everyone .When you make a wrong it effects everyone. If you swerve other cars would start to swerve because there trying not to get hit. So just wait to send the text or simply call them through the car Bluetooth!

Everyday people die because of using their cellphones while driving. According to many articles and actual news articles phones are the top reason that cause car crashes. Study shows that a cell phone puts drivers in a very high risk of a car accident. People tend to use phones while driving to prevent them from being bored and because they want to keep in contact with someone at all times. People need to avoid these habits and stop texting while driving or even putting their phones on a free hand phone stand. It can cause people to be distracted, and in a blink of an eye, anything can happen.

Unfortunately, people use their phone at the wrong time, while they are driving. It is very dangerous and can mess up your life in a blink of an eye. You may think ""oh i'll be fine i'm aware of my surroundings"" but you never know who is around you and what type of crazy drivers there are on the road. Using a phone makes it harder to focus on the road, according to articles pedestrians pass away because someone made the wrong decision now they will unfortunately have to live with it. A car is not a toy, we have to understand that there is a time a place to use our phones. Most accidents are caused by teens under the age of 21, last year there were about 5,000 accidents mostly caused by teens.

When people are using their phones it's mostly at a traffic stop, they don't end up paying attention so it holds everyone up then others get angry. Phones are a huge distraction it's a habit we all need to break. In this generation they are now making cars that have a screen in the front that looks like a big Ipad, and hand free cars. Just imagine the distraction that will cause and the amount of car accidents as well. Electronics are getting very serious and they tend to be distracted very easily.

Now that we get a clear understanding on what phones can do when we drive and what the effects are. We should start a no phones campaign to reduce the cellphone usage so it can reduce the amount of car accidents. We could give out information that shows people what could happen so they can think twice about texting and driving. And stricter laws should be in place for it. These types of things should be taken very seriously no matter the situation.

In conclusion, texting while driving is a big issue, we are doing it everyday and not realizing how much we are putting our lives in a danger and even the others on the road. Leave the phone alone while you are driving because a text is not worth a life, that text will be there when you get to your destination.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Each year phones are getting more advanced, which makes them more addicting for society. This addiction has gotten so bad people use them while in the driver's seat. According to the NLM and NIH they say, ""After declining from 1999 to 2005, fatalities from distracted driving increased 28% after 2005, rising from 4572 fatalities to 5870 in 2008"". This proves the idea that distracted driving is growing because of the popularity of phones. Phones should not be allowed during driving because it puts lives at risk, it sets a bad example for future drivers, and it increases the chance for a car crash which means more cost for car damages. All drivers should pay attention to the road to ensure they are ready to respond to any situation.

All drivers should leave their phones while driving because it puts lives at risk. As stated by the Miller and Zois law firm more and more people are dying from distracted driving accidents a year. In the article it says, ""The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year."" The evidence given supports the idea that due to the use of phones being so popular the number of people in an accident increases and that many of these accidents could have been avoided if drivers had paid attention to the road. In an article made by TeenSafe, it provides an incident about a woman that killed and injured young children due to texting and driving. In the article it says, ""In May of 2017, Ohio woman Natasha Boggs, 25, killed two 14-year-old girls and severely injured a 15-year-old boy when she was texting and driving."" This was a sad accident that was caused because of the use of phones while driving. The evidence shows that the use of phones while driving causes innocent drivers to turn into killers. Phones should not be used while driving since it causes lives to be lost.

The use of phones while driving should not be allowed because it spreads to the next generation. If the older drivers text while driving it shows newer drivers that it's ok to do it. According to a survey done by Jama Pediatrics, many parents say that using phones while driving is bad but about half of them still do it. In the article, it states, ""Indeed, 52 percent of millennial parents (22 to 37 years old) and 58 percent of older parents said they thought it was 'never' safe to text and drive..... But almost two-thirds of parents have read texts while driving, and more than half of them have also written texts, the survey of 435 parents in 45 U.S. states found."" The evidence provided helps prove that parents are not providing exemplary performances for their kids who will one day grow up repeating the process. With this study done by Jama Pediatrics it stamps the idea that texting and driving should stop with the older drivers to make sure the future of driving is bright for the newer. The NHTSA has ways on lowering the rate of distracted driving crashes. As stated by the NHTSA they say, ""Parents first have to lead by example-by never driving distracted-as well as have a talk with their young driver about distraction and all of the responsibilities that come with driving. Have everyone in the family sign the pledge to commit to distraction-free driving."" This is an important comment because the next generation of drivers wouldn't now the exemplary way of driving if someone didn't show them. If parents or other qualified drivers don't teach kids the exemplary way to drive then lots of car accidents are going to happen and one of them might lose a life

Texting and driving is a dangerous activity and should not be allowed because of the increased chance of a car crash and the cost of that crash. In any car accident it can cost a lot to repair the damages and if the driver is in continuous car accidents due to texting and driving the cost can double. According to Peachtree Financial Solutions they say, ""In the event that an individual is involved in an accident with substantial damage, the typical cost can run approximately $5000 to start and then quickly increase from there, depending on the specifics of the accident."" This was included to show how much money a person could have to pay for in a car accident which could have been done by texting and driving. A study done by The Zebra on young drivers presents critical information. For example, the article says, ""Including the cost to people's lives, these crashes were responsible for $129 billion - or 15 percent - of the overall societal damage caused by motor vehicle crashes. This number only goes up after your primary offense."" The evidence shown explains that the cost of car crashes is very high. This can be best interpreted that getting into a car crash would not be beneficial to a person in a person in a car crash a situation which could be caused by texting and driving. If the cost of car crashes is constantly increasing each year then people shouldn't be texting and driving because it causes car crashes.

The evidence shown above helps prove that phones are dangerous to use while driving because it puts lives at risk, sets bad examples for future drivers, and it increases the chance of a car crash which means a lot of money to pay for damage. It's important to realize that if we don't take more offensive action to stop texting while driving then it will ruin the lives of families. If we don't stop this, the bad actions will carry on to the next generation and the next until we stop.

If we don't stop this then car crashes will continue to occur and the price for the damage will skyrocket. Texting while driving needs to be taken more seriously or the world will be chaotic.

Thousands of people die every year from people driving and texting. Texting and driving should be banned because it puts other people's lives in danger.

If a person crashes his or her car while driving, insurance on their vehicle could go up. A car crash can also kill loved ones, people riding with the intention of getting to point A to point B can be dismissed because of a car accident and a careless driver.

The main reason why why people text while driving is because they are really addicted to their cellular devices. Careless drivers should not be allowed on the streets because it is very risky to other drivers out there. In a car crash, the person getting hit can be seriously injured or even worse, that person could lose their legs or die. The driver that was distracted by texting can also put his or her passengers lives at risk. Somebody inside the car could fly out the windshield as soon as the car hits, worse scenario is that there is a probability that the vehicle can catch on fire while the passengers and the driver are inside the vehicle.

In a vehicle, insurance can be expensive or cheap, but it depends on what kind of insurance the vehicle has. Full coverage is the best one, it can back up anybody that gets in a car accident. The liability insurance is good too, but it does not cover that much if a person gets involved in a car accident. So, going with full coverage should be the best choice. Insurance insures your vehicle, driving without insurance is illegal. If a person gets into a car accident, insurance is there to help but if a person was too busy distracted on their phone, the insurance payment will go up. A driver that gets him or herself into an accident and they were very distracted on their phone, there could be some bad consequences.

Getting into an accident can cause serious problems to the vehicle getting hit. The vehicle can be totaled which means that the vehicle can no longer be driven. If the driver goes too fast and he or she has their family aboard, they could be seriously injured if they crash. Losing someone you love in a car accident can be devastating. Most people don't get to sleep right knowing that they killed someone they loved in a car accident due to a distraction on their phone. Some people don't even drive anymore knowing what they did to a loved one. Losing a family member in a car accident is very sad, and very disappointing to the driver.

Texting while driving is very dangerous. It could put the driver's life at risk but when there is an emergency, the driver should be able to attend that emergency but a safe and lawful way. Let's say, that a family member is very sick and he or she doesn't have a vehicle to drive itself to a hospital and the only way to take that person to a hospital is by calling someone for help. If that person doesn't pick up the phone, the other person that's sick could die. Many would say that this is a reasonable excuse but risking the life of an innocent drier is not acceptable.

Therefore, texting and riving should be illegal because insurance rates raise in price, it is against moral conduct, and it is the reason many people die. Distracted driving could be the cause of many fatalities but placing the phone down while driving could save millions. You would not want to live with the death of someone on your shoulders.

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crash. Despite the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to keep in touch with people. They also think that hands free is safe because they're driving with two hands.

Dangers of phones and driving

Fatal accidents related to cell phones and driving have risen dramatically over the years. It usually happens with people around 25 years or younger. 1 out of every 4 accidents in the U.S is caused by texting while driving. Answering a text while driving takes your attention away from the road for five seconds. If you're traveling 55 mph that's enough time to travel the length of a football field.

Nearly 390,000 injuries accrue each year caused by texting while driving. You are six times more likely to cause an accident by texting while driving drunk. Texting is by far the most dangerous cell phone related task. 94% of drivers support a ban on texting while driving. 74% support a ban of handheld cell phone use.

Consequences of phones/driving

Georgia's driving law prevents text messaging and hand held cell phone use for all drivers. For drivers it is illegal to write, send, or read a text while driving.

The texting law applies to cell phones, tablets, messaging devices and laptops. First offense a motorist is looking at a fine for 50 dollars and a demerit. Second offense 100 dollar fine and two demerits. Thirds offense is 150 dollars and three demerits.

I believe people should not have their phone in their hands or looking at it while they drive because it distracts them from the road. The correlation between phone usage and accidents is 1.6 million crashes every year. Many people don't see it as such a bad thing or a something that is so important but in reality it is. When you stare at your phone for just second while driving that can cause you to not pay attention to anything that can happen around you.

It's okay for people to use them when they are parked in a safe place away from where people can get hurt such as a parking lot or a driveway but if you are at a red light and you start to use it that is just as dangerous as actually driving and looking down at it. No circumstance should allow for anyone to use their phones while driving unless they are an emergency response vehicle such as police firefighters or emt. I hope people see and realize the dangers of driving while texting and see that the lives of others around them are just as important because anything can change in a split second.

If some people don't see the big problem of texting and driving, then they shouldn't have a phone or be allowed to drive.

E810BA3D54AC,"Drivers should not be using their phones while driving a vehicle. Over years, many people have been in a car accident due to using their phones while driving. Many times people are victims because they were not using their phones, but the other driver was. Some drivers do not think about the consequences, they do not think of other people's life. Using phones while driving can also be a reason a police officer can pull any driver over and give them a ticket. It is not just adults who do this, every year there are new teens driving and many of them may be using their phone while driving right now.

In a texting and driving statistics shows that nearly 390,000 accidents occur due to people texting and driving. In those thousands of accidents there are also some teens who were also in a car accident. Many deaths have happened during those accidents and it all happened just because we as humans seem to be too attached to phones and can not wait any longer to text back or to return a call. When drivers use their phones while driving, they have made a decision to make a distraction to themselves and take their eyes of the road.

In car accidents caused by using the phone while driving,there are also victims who do not use their phones, but end up in a accident. The driver who is using their phone will take their eyes off the road and may be likely to hit another car. Anyone can be a victim, they could just be walking and not notice or think anything bad will happen. Anyone who is driving should never use their phone while driving, they need to think about the consequences. They need to think as if they were the victim, and need to learn that being on their phone is not important.

Police officers will pull any driver over if they see them holding their phone, they will not care if the driver was using it or not. The officers are pulling them over before anything worse happens. If an adult gets pulled over they will receive a ticket from the officer or they may be under arrest if they do not have a license. If a teen gets pull over they will get points taken away from their driving permit and will also get a ticket. If people think about it, sending a text is not worth paying a ticket with the money that you could have bought something for themselves.

Drivers using their phones while driving should think twice if it is worth it or not. They can lose their life and make someone else lose their life. They will also get pulled over and receive a ticket and lose money just for trying to reply to a text. Due to using the phones while driving many people have been in a car accident and many have lost their lives. Drivers should also think about others and how they can affect someone's life. People should know that the text can wait and that they can reply to a text when they have reached their destination.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6
F6FD47E8BDA2,"Smartphones ,like every other piece of technology,have been a two edged sword. They have fused to us. They are the ultimate tool. They have saved lives. They have also caused many deaths. One study done by teensafe. com in 2019 found 26% of car crashes are related to cell phones. Most of these crashes were strictly because of texting. In order to limit deaths and make roads safer,handheld devices that distract the driver from the road should be prohibited while driving.

The first problem is that phones take up a lot of focus. Humans by design can only do one thing at once and this can be proven by a very simple experiment. Try to pat your stomach and rub your head around in a clockwise manner. This is difficult because every time you attempt to multitask,your brain is really switching back and forth repeatedly between the two tasks. This is very taxing on the brain. This presents the problem with texting and driving. when attempting to text and drive,you take attention off of driving putting the driver and everyone else around them in great danger.

Another problem is that holding a phone in your hand physically impedes on the mobility of the driver. In every driver's manual it distinctly states that every driver should place both hands on the steering wheel. If you don't have both hands on the steering wheel,you are much more likely to be unprepared for the fast decisions you will have to make as there is much less traction on the steering wheel. This also forces you to make a greater effort in order to move the steering wheel.

Some argue that the use of phones has become essential to the average driver and that both activities require so much time that they must overlap on each other's time. I would agree with those people. I would say that the solution to the problem in that case are to only take away the use of handheld devices and allow the use of artificial intelligence,such as siri and alexa,and wireless headsets.

The problem of accidents due to handheld devices has been going on way too long. Awearness was not raised enough and people became complacent. I said before that 26% of car crashes happen because of phones,but the truth is that even 1% is too much. We can raise laws in order to stop this trend,but the truth is that this can only truly be diminished on an individual level through positive peer pressure and peer accountability.

When people look at their phone no matter what they are doing it is messing with their vision. It's dangerous because when adults are driving and cannot see they are likely to hit someone or something. Not only could they possibly kill themselves but if there is a young child walking they could have their life taken over just a simple text message.

When you add the many factors into adults driving and the dangers its imaginary. The light outside and how dark it is will be put into play, if the road is wet it'll make it slippery or even just other drivers. The life of an innocent child is much more important than any text message anyone could ever send. There are many different ways to make life easier and safer, such as Bluetooth and voice activated features. The world would most definitely be safer and much easier to live in if everyone did their part not to be distracted while they are driving.

No one wants to have to worry about having their child die by some distracted driver while they are walking but everyday kids get killed either on accident or on purpose. It happens and no one wants to admit it but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Just looking at your cell phone it takes your eyes away from the road just long enough for you to swerve and take out a little kid. No one really thinks of kids when they are driving around on the highway or a normal road but the children should always be on everyone's mind.

It is a terrible shame that the world and our ever growing economy does not care enough about our children and young adults to stay off their phone. While young adults themselves are a big part to blame for the recklessness and irresponsibly whilst driving we cannot put the blame on one group of children. Just like no one can put all the blame on adults we are all responsible for driving when we are and if anyone makes the tragic mistake of using their cellphone while it may not cause the death of them it may just very well be the cause of an unfortunate death      ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

In today's time, we all want to stay connected to our family, friends, and loved ones, now even more than ever. With the boom in technology and smart phones, it is no surprise that just about everyone has one. With those advances, we are able to keep in touch and stay connected with everyone by calling, sending emails, using social media, and by texting. Even though it may be easy and convenient to stay connected, and even though there are many other positive effects of technology, there also comes many negative effects are there comes great dangers to include texting and driving. There are both positive and negative effects when driving as well, when adding texting and other distractions in while driving, the negative effects, and dangers are increased a lot more. Calling and texting while behind the wheel has become increasingly common for many drivers in today's society, and just as it can become common, it has led to many distractions, more accidents, and more fatalities.

One cardinal rule of driving has always been to keep both hands on the wheel. While driving, even with the car on cruise control, sometimes we forget how much of a risk we are taking as we are not only responsible for our car, we must stay protected and cautious of those around us as well. Even though we only think of the temporary satisfaction or benefit that we have from driving, we often don't think of how we put ourselves, other drivers, and pedestrians at risk. Driving requires a lot of focus and it requires our full and undivided attention. Texting and driving places you at risk because you are taking your eyes off the road, you are taking your hands off of the wheel, and evening more you are taking your mind off of driving. Distractions such as texting or even calling can cause some of the smallest or some of the most life threatening, life altering issues. It is no surprise that texting while driving takes your concentration off the road and with the distractions, even for a second, it could have consequences some minor, while others can bring on serious consequences. With just a second of texting, we can miss important signs or messages on the road, it can lead to speeding which can lead to very expensive tickets. In addition to speeding fines and tickets, distracted driving also leads to higher insurance premiums which add up to be a lot over time. To some, that risk may be minor, but another serious consequence for distracted driving is that it can lead to jail time. It does not matter how good of a driver you may think you are or how good your driving skills may be, unless you are capable of equally concentrating on multiple things at one time (which is not possible), you will be distracted when doing anything other than focusing on the road, and that places you and others at a serious risk.

Accidents on the road can happen and anytime and for a number of reasons, but it is no surprise that if texting and driving leads to more distractions, those distractions also leads to more accidents and more fatalities. Over the years, as technology has advanced and with more ways to stay connected, combined with people that refuse to make the right decision, the rates and statistics of texting related deaths have drastically increased. While checking messages and emails, making phone calls, or even sending the shortest message, so many things can go wrong. Just the slightest distraction can cause someone to run off the road causing them to run off the road, hit another car, or even hit a pedestrian, Those distractions combined with high speeds, a tiny click of the finger can cause many to be critically injured or it can cause someone to lose their life. According to Luke Ameen, 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United Stated are caused by texting and driving, 421,000 are injured in car crashed that have involved a driver who is distracted in some way, and 37,000 people die in auto accidents every year due to being distracted or texting while driving and those numbers are expected to increase over the years. Texting or reading a message takes your eyes off the road for a minimum of three seconds and within those short seconds someone can lose their lives or sustain life threatening injuries that they would have to live with for the rest of their lives. Even if all of those drivers are not at fault, they could have probably avoided the accident if they were not distracted by texting.

In an effort to reduce the number of accidents and fatalities caused by distracted drivers, people can take simple steps to help save lives. Although auto accidents take place every day and for a variety of reasons, distractions seem to cause more of a problem so if we limit or stop the distractions we can prevent accidents and help to save more people. While driving it is important for people to save the distractions for later. People have been encouraged to put their phones on silent or to turn them off, they can put their phones out of their reach such as in the glove compartment, back seat, or their trunks, or they can take other measures such as downloading apps that would prevent them from using the phone when it has been detected that their vehicles are in motion. While these are just a few things that can be done, people should do what is best for them. While these actions may seem extreme to some, saving their life or the lives of others is more important. Most states and insurance companies have also put policies and other actions in place that will assist with reducing the number of fatalities causes by texting or distracted driving. Most states have provided discounts for safe drivers while other states are issuing fines and some go to the extreme of jail time if drivers are caught texting or using their phones while driving. When driving, we are faced with enough dangers. Even though we want to stay connected to our friends, family, and loved ones, all it takes is a few seconds to never be able to get that opportunity again. While behind the wheels, taking simple actions can help save our life or the life of others. There are several options that we can take to cause an accident and just the same, there are several options that can be taken to prevent them from happening as well.

Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crash. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous, and people should avoid talking while driving.

Police, businessmen, and other office workers state that they have to be able to answer important calls. But the same for people that aren't police, or businessmen, or office workers aren't allowed to answer their phones or be on there phones while driving should be the same as officers, businessmen, and office workers. The conversation with business workers can lead to crashing or tragedy. So, if people don't make decisions to stay off their phones while driving can harm innocent people.

Hands free went into effect in 2018 stating that if you are pulled over for being on our phone its 1000$ fine. But handsfree devices don't eliminate the fact of causing an accident. Research says that having a headset or Bluetooth is as dangerous as having a phone in your hand because the conversation you are having distracts them and can lead to an accident. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So, the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the time.

However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always preparing to help you in an accident.

One of the most dangerous situations to use a cellphone is when operating a vehicle. The risks that come with this include but are not limited to getting a citation, causing a collision, and even provoking death to the driver or those in his or her surroundings.

Most U.S. states and territories have laws against using a cellphone and driving (fcc. gov). Getting pulled over for doing so can be punishable with expensive citations, being arrested, and can even lead to the suspension of the offender's driver's license. These consequences also directly impact the daily lives of drivers. For example, a suspended license means having to find rides or paying for taxi fares which ends up being very expensive and inefficient. Also, jail time leads to absenteeism at work or school which can lead to falling behind and even losing a job or a scholarship due to a traffic violation arrest record.

Not only is it illegal to text and drive, but it is also extremely dangerous and can lead to automobile accidents. Distracted drivers are more likely to not follow

In 2016 over 330,000 accidents were caused by distracted drivers that were using a cellphone at the time of the event (distracteddriveraccidents. com). According to Forbes, the average car insurance premium is around $815 which means that if an accident were to be reported it could cost the policy holder and extra $335 per year in premiums. Causing accidents can also lead to points being added to a driver's license which raises insurance costs even more and leads to certain restrictions being placed on the offender's legal driving abilities.

In The United States alone approximately 9 people die every day because of distracted drivers (cdc. gov). That's over 3,250 preventable deaths every year because someone decided not to put their phone down when getting behind the wheel. In 2016 alone, 1,500 people in Georgia died in car accidents due to phone related incidents and this number is expected to rise due to innovations in technology (ajc. com). Not only does this information prove how serious of a situation texting and driving is, but it also gives an idea of how much of an impact it is making on society.

states,""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". This statement made by the author is showing us how serious texting and driving is. Everytime someone picks up their phone they will possibly become another accident caused by texting and driving. Also in the article it states,""Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk"". We all know how serious and dangerous drunk driving is so if texting and driving is more dangerous than that then we have a real problem on our hands.

The question of ¨ Should Cellphones be allowed to use while driving?¨, Is on the minds of many and it is believed that Cell phones should be used responsibly while driving to be able to stay safe and contact those you need to. Since Cellphones are storage for information to use and a fast way to contact anyone you want or need to at any time. However, Cellphones are also methods of distractions for those driving, leading to car crashes which causes injury and death.

Keeping both these in mind Cellphones should be used while driving but only to a certain degree.

Without a restriction on Cellphone usage, the results may be disastrous. A record in 2017 from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 people were killed in 2,935 distraction-affected crashes, accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States(¨

Cell Phones ¨). Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent(¨ Cell Phones ¨). There is also the fact of high school students who reported frequent texting while driving were less likely to wear a seat belt, more likely to ride with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, and more likely to drink and drive, and typing text messages reduces a driver's ability to adequately direct attention to the roadway, respond to important traffic events, and to control a vehicle within a lane and with respect to other vehicles(¨ Cell Phones ¨).

With all these dangers present when you use your phone and drive it's hard to see why people should be allowed in any way at all. Sadly the world is not and will never be that black and white. For those using their phones, there could be a plethora of reasons including Contacting bosses and appointments to state a late arrival, contacting family and friends for important news or updates, and more. Granted, reasons may also include just wanting to converse with others and update their social media but in this day and age, more teens will be doing just that. Luckily there is a way to do all of these and still maintain a safe driving ability and that is by using Bluetooth and vocal activation/response. These features in cars and phones allow you to text back and read messages through your phone or your car just by speaking back. There is also the ability to call via Bluetooth and speak verbally while still focusing on the road and still checking in with your boss, coworkers, family, and friends.

It's no longer a matter or should or should not but a matter of how. The dangers of cellphone usage while driving is apparent in everyday life and in the shocking statistics of the matter and yet it still happens. With the technology available and proper rationale it is possible to get the best of both worlds, you can contact others for any reason and also be able to drive safely on the road. Therefore, cell phones should be allowed while driving but only to a certain degree; which is the hands' free talk and text available to you via car Bluetooth or voice recognition on your cellular devices.

The share of American adults that own smartphones is now 81%, up from just 35% in pew research center. Most of the 81% is responsible adults around the United States, so that means they are responsible enough to know how to use a phone in a car. I think that should be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Drivers should be able to use phones while driving the car because, now a days there is a Bluetooth in cars that most drivers can connect their phone in once they have gotten in. Once that happen people can answer the phone without picking up their cell phone and having to hold it up to their ear, instead it will just sound off through the car.

Another reason I think that drivers should be able use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because, many people do follow the rules and not answer the phone and not text while driving but, what if it what an emergency that has occurred but, people don't want to answer the phone because they don't want to get caught. People should be able to pick up a phone during an emergency because, if it were a family emergency, I would want to pick up the phone up as soon as possible.

Overall my understanding would be that People should be able to use cell phones while driving, not many people would say it's safe but when it comes down to being responsible, I think people like that, that know how to manage their time on the phone and as cautious as could be , with a Bluetooth speaker in their car would be good source to use instead of having to pick up the phone and having to put it up to your ear in making it notice , but if you are as responsible as people who know how not to pick up a phone you should try using Bluetooth in your car for you can start using it.

Cars are a very expensive item in life and are used for everyday transportation. Phones are somewhat an important necessity and play an important role in many of our lives. Combined together has always been a horrible idea but many believe that they should be allowed to be on the phone while operating their vehicle. Cars and Phones should never be allowed together because of the many risks it could cause to the safety of many people.

Cars were created as another way of transportation and take you basically anywhere you need to go, throughout the year's many car companies have improved the technology that goes into the cars to make them more safe and reliable for the customers. New features have made cars super safe but many people tend to use their personal electronics while driving and it can lead to many incidents. Cars do a lot in everyday life and when people decide to use their phones while driving it causes many bad and sometimes deadly accidents. Many casualties are sometimes blamed on the car companies for the accidents but more investigation shows that many car accidents are caused by distracted drivers that use their phones whilst operating their vehicles. Car companies have been made to pay millions in lawsuits because of people not taking responsibilities and putting their phone down rather being distracted and still finding a way to beat the system to sue the car companies.

Phones are an important essential that many that have the privileges to have and provide so much for everyday life. The technological advantages that many phone companies like Samsung and Apple have put new technology that offers the driver to turn on driving mode which basically turns off every notification. This is very helpful and very useful because it helps the driver is more focused on the road and less distracted with his or her phone. Phones used to only be household items that were usually kept on the walls of the homes and usually could only be used in the homes. Phones were very essential to those who were fortunate enough to have them because they were able to communicate with family and friends across the country. However, those who could not afford phones were not fortunate enough to buy them whereas those who could have the opportunity to do anything.

Phones and Cars have never been a good idea combined together because of the many risks it carries. On average, deaths caused by cell phone usage whilst operating a vehicle is roughly above 1.6 million deaths per year. People do not realize how dangerous it is to operate their vehicle while being distracted and they take it for granted because in a split second that can all be taken from you in the snap of a finger. Many argue that they can multitask and use their phone whilst operating their vehicle. Although, car companies have made attempts to improve the technology for drivers to become less distracted but they still distract themselves.

In conclusion, I believe that Cars and phones should never be allowed together but there is no way to prohibit cellular phones and it's tragic but if we made an effort to cut down on this distraction there will be a change in that number of deaths.   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

When we are driving sometimes this distraction causes tragedies that could have been easily avoided if we were to simply avoid use of our phones while driving. The use of cellphones while driving in any capacity is something that should not be allowed under any circumstances because it is a dangerous distraction while driving.

Driving on public roads in the United States of america is already a privilege that most of the population takes for granted. With 68% people in the united states having the ability to drive, it is crucial that the safety of every person and vehicle on the road is kept up to standard and that the driver of the vehicle is responsible for the safety of themselves as well as others on the road. When a driver picks up the phone they immediately break focus of the road leading to increased chances of a crash or accident.

One of the main reasons for the citation of use of a cellphone while driving is because it is a danger to oneself but also a danger to other drivers on the road. Sence cell phone use impairs the attention of the road, accidents where people are injured are more likely to occur. Even though you may be aware of what you're doing while driving, another big factor is paying attention to what other drivers are doing. When you are using a cellphone in any way, you are less likely to see these potential dangers.

One of the leading causes of early death is due to car accidents, and many times a cellphone plays a role in why an error was made which caused a crash. The price of ones life is worth much more than a notification from a cell phone. and endanger their own life as well as the others around them solely for their benefit is wrong. That is something that should be outlawed and forbidden under any circumstances. Safety is the number one priority when driving and using a cellphone while driving is one of the most unsafe practices to do while driving. Endangering others is never worth more than looking at a notification from your cell phone.

The use of cellphones while driving should not be allowed anywhere and strict restrictions should be set in place all over the world to stop the use of cellphones while driving. Using a cellphone in any way while driving increases your chances of an accident and not only endangers the life of you, but also the other drivers on the road. Using a cellphone while driving is not worth the potential risk.   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8
F3C6201B3A15,"Cell Phones are a very controversial problem with today's society. Cell phones cause damage with our eyes and put our bodies at risk. Driving is already dangerous and many people die almost every day from car crashes, or car malfunctions. So adding a mobile device that already has so many disadvantages and makes your health worse, is just bad. Cell phones on an average can bring soreness of eyes, and blurred vision, and headaches. If that's not enough you can even get a type of an eye cancer.

Using Cell Phones are very dangerous and can cause serious issues while putting it with Driving. Drivers should be off their phone while operating a vehicle as such, no matter if it's a car, a truck, or a motorcycle, no driver should.

There are three reasons as to why I think drivers should not use a cell phone while driving but the first one is for the drivers' safety themselves. The drivers' safety is the most important. ""Distracted Drivers"", which means they are doing something else while not paying attention to the road, is one of the main causes of the accidents. 27% percent of adults admit to texting while driving, according to esurance. com, 24% percent Of fatal car crashes are adults are aged 30 to 39 were also involved with cell phone use. What I'm referring to this information for is because adults are supposed to be, or at least traditionally the responsible ones. You would think that they would put the phone down but no they text and drive or even talk on the phone while driving.

Which is putting their life at risk. If you are driving you are handling an over 40 ton machine which has a lot of speed on it, even for a truck. So when you add additional stuff like a text, which can wait until u get home or at a stop you'd rather, get yourself killed and most likely others. You're basically, if it's a fatal car crash then, killing yourself which is suicide.

You're taking yourself away from your family which is not right.

My next point is that you're not only taking yourself, but additionally your taking someone else away from their family. Which is murder, and murder is really bad especially if you live the car crash and you are the one who was on their phone, YOU will be sentenced to life in prison or maybe even worse just because YOU couldn't put the phone down. According to edgarsnyder. com, 390,000 injuries occur each year, just from using cellular devices while driving.

But this is the more disturbing fact, 11 teens are killed EVERY single day in the United States. That's a scary number and considering those are not just from people texting and driving but the innocent are killed. This is basically proof that cell phones are killing machines and should be inaccessible while operating a motor vehicle. Just imagine irresponsibly texting on your phone and not thinking of the safety of others. Then BOOM, you have just killed young boy or girl in their late teens driving home from a job or restaurant and whom may have had more people in their car.

Then the person parents have to hear that their child was killed due to your irresponsibility. It's just really sickening and depressing.

The third and final reason as to why cell phone use should not be allowed while driving is because it's just costly. Georgia passed the law on June 1st 2018. The fine will be 50$ and it will be doubled your second offense, according to USA Today's Article on the new founded law. Distracted driving is a main problem in today world. It has come to a certain point in today's America to where WE as a people need a law on not using our cellular devices. It should already be put in your mind after so many lives of young teens and adults' lives have been lost. But that's not good that you have to pay a fine and on top of that if you get caught in an accident, you will have to either be sued by the victim of the car crash or you will have to pay for expense on your car insurance. As an adult especially paying your bills and having to deal with a fine of $50. That is just unnecessary. According to CreditDonkey. com The average an adult spends money on groceries is $400. $400 is an absurd number for groceries, so just imagine getting sued and paying a fine and even on top of that paying car insurance. You my friend have just dug yourself in a huge hole that is going to take a while on.

To conclude, Using your cell phone is and should be banned and illegal. It is a hazard to others and should be taken with seriousness. You are not only putting yourself at risk but many others. Everyone knows that your phone is an addiction and it is just something we do off impulse but that is no excuse. Train your brain to say no and put the phone down. The text or phone call is not nearly as important as driving on the road is and I hope people will start to realize the importance of this topic and will consider it in their own lives, Will You?

78668D3769A3,"Over the past 4 decades cell phones have evolved extremely.

Nowadays people use their phones for just about any and everything. Things such as texting, calling, playing games, booking appointments, even checking latest posts on social media and much more. Cell phones started to become a problem when people were just looking down at their phones while crossing the street. Something that could be fixed. Now, people are choosing to use their phones while driving which has become an issue and is very dangerous. Which puts not only the driver in danger put others as well.

Each day people are dying or being injured from using their cellular devices while being behind the wheel. Each year 421,000 people in the United States are injured due to a driver being distracted by their device. It's more common for teens and young adults to text and drive (ages 18-24). 14% of fatal crashes are involved from texting and driving in this age division.

In 2017 the ""Hands Free Law"" had been issued. Which means drivers are allowed to use hand free devices only while being behind the wheel of a car and being completely free of a device. Although people may think the hands free law has prevented less accident it hasn't it only makes people have the urge to reach for their devices even more. 11 teenagers die every day due to texting and driving. Teenagers are 400% more likely to get into an accident from texting and driving. AT&T's Teen Driver Survey found that 97% of teenagers think it's dangerous, while 43% of them engage in the activity anyway.

In conclusion I strongly disagree with texting and driving because it puts more than one person in danger. I feel as if you need to use your device while behind the wheel of a moving vehicle be mindful and pull to the side. Weather it's for making a quick call or sending a quick message even typing in a location into the GPS pull over because anything could happen in the blink of an eye.

F6ED2E2CEC67,"Why Drivers Should or Should Not Use Cell Phones While Driving

I strongly agree that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving a vehicle. One main reason is because you can cause a wreck. Second, you're putting your life at risk, and others that are in the vehicle with you. Lastly, you are distracted from the road. You can easily get killed.

One main reason is because you can cause a wreck. You can cause a wreck by being distracted by your cell phone due to looking down at it and not paying attention to the road. You can easily run a red light or a stop sign. When a wreck occurs the driver's negligence is liable for the accident victim's damages. Those are victims entitled to compensation for damages directly resulting from the collision. A crash typically happens in less than 5 seconds in the real world. Using your cell phone in one hand and driving with the other is another cause of a wreck. To prevent this from happening, drivers should use hands-free objects such as headphones, Bluetooth from car, and a car mount/windshield cell phone holder.

Second, you're putting your life at risk. You're putting you're life at risk because you could end up in a bad car accident. You might live; You might die. You never know. You are decreasing your awareness of the road leading to more car crashes. Texting and looking down at the phone distracts you twice as much as a phone call. This can cause various accidents and represent a danger to the physical integrity of the occupants of the car and also serious injuries.

Lastly, you are distracted from the road. You can easily get killed. Phone cause accidents. Someone could send you a message and you can take one little glance at it and you can have an accident right then and there. Social media distracts you as well, scrolling and looking down at your phone can cause a distraction and can also make you have a wreck. By the time you get down looking up from that device, you'll probably have already hit someone else's car. Phones are not more important than you losing your life. Put cell phones away and pay attention to the road. You don't want to end up injured or dead from something you can easily avoid while on the road. You'd rather be safe than sorry. They have multiple objects you can use for cell phones. You can use the cell phone holder. You stick it on your car's dashboard and it holds your cell phone so you can watch the road or maybe your car has Bluetooth in it and you can talk/text while driving at the same time.

In conclusion, I strongly agree that drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving a vehicle. One main reason is because you can cause a wreck. Second, you're putting your life at risk, and others that are in the vehicle with you. Lastly, you are distracted from the road. You can easily get killed.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6
DF71367F508F,"Today, we use our cell phones for just about anything and everything to include; texting, talking to our loved ones, and connecting with the rest of the world via social media. Cell phones have become a natural way of life to where we pick up our phones and use them like second nature. However, the dangers present themselves when we get behind the wheel of a car and carry these habits of cell phone addictions with us. If all states ban the use of cell phones while driving, then there would be a reduced amount of fatalities each year.

Texting and driving according to the National Safety Council, is responsible for 1.6 million accidents per year and 11 teen deaths every day according to the Ins. Institute for Highway Safety Administration. For drivers between the ages of 18 and 20, there were 13% that admitted to texting or talking on the phone at the time of the accident. While overall, 34% admitted to texting while driving, 52% admitted to talking on the phone while driving (Marino, 2012). A few seconds is all it takes to end your life or the life of someone else. On the road, Americans hold their lives and the lives of other drivers at risk because they are anxious to check how many likes their picture got or what plans they have for that night. These are things that can wait until you safely reach your destination. Many would agree that they are able to multitask while driving, to include answering calls, checking social media, and texting while driving, but the proof is in the statistics. Most people know that the usage of cell phones while driving is a dangerous thing to do, but they think they can do it safely this one time, but it's one of the major challenges.

Distracted driving is anything that takes your eyes or mental focus off the roadway. It can be as simple as sending a text message, answering a phone call, or reaching for something in the car. These are some of the distractions that we as Americans face on a day to day basis. Loosing focus of the road even for a brief moment can end in catastrophe. For example, if a driver is going at a rate of 55 mph and decides to check a text message, in 5 seconds they can drive the length of a football field before regaining focus on the road (Marino, 2012, p1). In this situation, this distraction can be the difference between life and death. Talking on the phone may not seem like a distraction; however, in reality it is far more than that. With new technology development, newer cars are now equipped with hands free Bluetooth. In my opinion, car manufactures should continue innovate and develop operational equipment in cars to make the danger factor of talking on the phone while driving non-existent. Lastly, multi-tasking is a distraction that most of the time goes unnoticed. From putting on makeup, eating fast food, to searching for items in the car, these are daily tasks we do in the car without thinking about it. What we don't realize, is that we are still putting our lives and the lives of others at risk by trying to multi-task while driving. 93% of rear end collisions occurred because the driver of the following car removed their eyes from the road 3 seconds prior to the collision (Bagg, 2006).

Some Americans would agree that all states should have stiffer laws when it comes to texting and driving. Currently, nine states including Washington D.C, and the Virgin Islands have banned drivers from using hand-held cell phones while driving, while no states have completely banned all cell phone use, thirty states, and Washington D.C. have banned cell phone use by new drivers and teen drivers. Furthermore, another thirty-five states, Washington D.C., and Guam, have banned texting while driving.

Although many cities have passed distracted driving bans, there are some states that refuse to enact those laws to include Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and Oklahoma. Opponents would agree that the more states banning distracted driving laws, the more safe our roadways would be (Albanesius, 2011). Distracted driving is a very serious offense and can carry severe sentences behind this madness. In some states, such as Massachusetts, distracted driver, which causes a death or injury can be charged with vehicular manslaughter which can be punishable up to 30 days in jail and fines ranging from $300-$3,000 and a license suspension for fifteen years. For example in 2012, an 18 year old, Aaron Deveau was texting while driving and the car he was driving crossed over into the center lane and hit an oncoming vehicle driven by a 55 year old male, which resulted in his death. This is just many of the documented fatalities that distracted driving causes and some would agree that there should be more severe consequences (McCarthy, 2015). Opponents think that creating laws banning someone from using cell phones while driving, would just make drivers mad and they would feel like this is an infringement of their rights as American's. One way we can eliminate distracted driving is to install a no-texting app on your cell phone which can alert an incoming caller sending them an automated message saying, ""Sorry I can't take your call right now, I'm driving"" or an app that cuts teen's cell phone service while driving. Sprint and AT&T are two of the cell phone providers that offer anti-texting apps (Professional Safety, 2013).

While cell phones are a huge benefit and can make life easier, let's not forget that distracted driving affects the lives of many every day from injuries to death. Keep our roadways safe by just putting your phone down and staying focused.   ",6,Phones and driving,Independent,1.0
B6E5218738F0,"Phones and Driving: Why They Don't Mix

Cell phones: most people have one in this day and age. With this prolific use of cellular devices throughout the modern world, they can be observed in almost every aspect of daily life. Roadways are no exception, which is a problem for both those using phones, and drivers nearby who aren't on their phones. While most states in America have banned texting and driving, many still allow limited or hands free use of cell phones. Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while on the roads; it endangers them, as well as drivers surrounding them.

Distracted driving is a major cause of driving-related accidents in the United States (26% of all car crashes in 2014 involved cell phone use, according to the Department of Motor Vehicles). 9 people a day are killed, and another 1000 injured as a result of distracted driving.

This a big problem especially amongst young people. 42% of teens admitted to texting and driving in 2015, and it is the leading cause of death in teenagers. The dangers of mixing cellular devices and driving are evident.

There is one very key reason that cell phones are a dangerous proposition in vehicles: focus. When driving, focus on the road and your surroundings is paramount. Having one's phone nearby leads the mind astray, and takes away from that ever so important focus. With the high speeds that are driven at today, one mistake leads to an accident. One mistake leads to serious injury and/or death in many cases. There are 3 different types of distractions present while driving: visual, manual, and cognitive distractions. Cell phone use is especially detrimental in this scenario because it embodies all 3. A phone takes your eyes off the road, your hands off the wheel, and your mind away from driving; a deadly trifecta. It is well known, why cellphones are a danger, and the effects they have had on roadway safety, now appropriate action must be taken to combat this crisis.

Texting and driving has been banned in 47 of the United States, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. Of those, only 15 states ban completely hand held use of cell phones while driving. Not enough is being done to combat this problem; in spite of these steps taken in the right direction, the statistics surrounding cell phone related car accidents is still far too high. There should be a national level ban of handheld use while driving in the United States.

While the tragedy of cell phone related car accidents, or car accidents in general for that matter, cannot be prevented, there is more that can be done in order to combat this problem, and it is absolutely necessary that it is done. Handheld use of cellphones should not be legal in the United States, for the safety of everyone who uses the roads, and anyone who walks alongside them.

I think cell phones should be banned while driving. The use of cellphones while driving can cause many accidents. Most states already have a law that prohibits the use of cellphones while driving. Car accidents are the leading cause of deaths for teenagers. Another reason they should be banned is because of the rise in ones insurance.

Many beginning drivers are the ones who are most likely to text and drive. They feel like they are free and feel they look cool with their phones out while behind the wheel. Not only teenagers, but anyone can be talking on the phone and get distracted and cause an accident. The use of cellphones is the leading cause of many accidents.

Due to the high rate of accidents, insurance is very expensive. Insurance is extremely high for teenagers because they are the ones who tend to cause more accidents. Personally, I have almost hit many cars because I was distracted by a text message or a phone call. Since the economy and world is very different now, money is very tight. Let's face it, nobody wants to pay a high amount or even pay with their life just to check one message.

Not only do you have to watch for cars, but for pedestrians as well. If you are in a crowded area, or somewhere near many sidewalks, avoid your phone. Anyone can be crossing the road at anytime and since the person is not paying attention to the road, there can be a very deadly accident. Hitting a pedestrian is probably the worst thing you could do. There are now new apps on cell phones that will let others know you are on the road.

Therefore, do not text and drive. Being distracted on your phone can cause many accidents. You can hit a car, make others crash, or even worse, hit a pedestrian while they're crossing the road. Cell phones should be banned when driving.              ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

It has been a numerous numbers of crashes while people have been driving and on a cellphone. Some people might feel that driving while on cellphone is okay, but it has been reported to be illegal. Overall using a cellphone increases driver's risk of causing a crash or death to a family, or person. Driver's are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more crashes.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not just yourself. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cellphones whether they want to or not. Driving is a privilege and some people take it for granted.

Driving you have to be very careful for yourself and for other drivers. One minute you're here and next your gone because you were on your phone or not paying attention to the road or other drivers that driving on the other side of the road or by you. It is only a matter of seconds before you are dead and gone.

Texting while driving causes a 400 percent increase in time spent with eyes off the road. Of all related tasks, texting is by far the most dangerous activity while driving. Texting while driving is becoming a life-threatening norm for people driving. With inexperienced drivers with lack of skills, cell phones use can especially deadly for teen drivers. It has been many deaths from car crashes while on a cellphone. Adults for the most part can't ever stay of their phones, cause every time I'm driving I see it.

In conclusion because technology will change and new distractions will be introduced parents need to take action. It isn't a good idea for you to drive while on the phone because it can cause serious danger. Also parents should avoid calling their teen while he or she is driving. Instead ask to be called before leaving one place and when arriving at the next destination. A teen may feel attempted to answer a parent's call if received while driving.

While driving, drivers have to focus on the road so they can see where they are going, but if they're staring at their phones they could get into a serious accident. When teens get into car accidents, it is likely due to them paying more attention to their phones then the road. Operating in-hand a cell phone while driving is against the law and there is a punishment for it. Driving in a crowded area while on your phone can lead to a car crash that will injure a lot of people. Many pedestrians die due to getting hit by distracted drivers who are on their phones. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because they can injure themselves and others.

Using a hand-held mobile device while driving is illegal. When driving or riding a vehicle, you should not use or be distracted by your mobile phone. If you use your mobile phone when driving you risk prosecution for not having total control of your vehicle. The hands-free law is when a driver cannot have a phone in their hand or use any part of their body to support their phone while driving. Drivers should know this law when they get their driver's license. The hands free law is there for a reason and that reason is to keep people safe.

Breaking the hands free law has serious consequences, you have to pay a fine and get your license suspended or taken. The fine for a first conviction is

$50.00 and 1 point assesed against the driver's license. The fine is $100.00 and 2 points for a second conviction, and $150.00 and 3 points for three or more convictions. The more points you get on your license for breaking the hands free law your license will be taken away. In Georgia, the driver's points will stay on for 2 years; however, that is based on 2 years from the date the points are added to your driving record/history. If caught breaking this law you'll be paying a lot of money and losing your driver's license.

Driving without paying attention to the road is very dangerous that it can cause harm to the driver and the people around it. Driver's should know that they can't have any hand-held mobile devices while driving because they are risking their own life. The hand free law is a serious law and it's there to keep the drivers safe. The punishment are serious when the hands free law is broken. Drivers can get their license taken if they get caught more than once on their phone while driving. If a driver is looking at their phones and hits a pedestrian and the pedestrian dies, then the driver will likely face manslaughter charges. If any drivers value their lives and others around them then they would pay attention to the road instead of their phones.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

In our day and time phones have become the main problem in this world. Phones have made it so easy for people to get in trouble and into wrecks. Why are phones so important that we can't even put it down while there driving? So, what can we try to do to prevent people getting distracted by their phones while driving?

Why are phones so important that we can't even put them down while driving? Well for one it is because social media, social media has impacted this world to where people think that they must be on it 24/7. This is getting to the point to where people are having to many wrecks and losing lives over their phones. Phones while driving is just another way to say an accident waiting to happen. So, let's try to not let our phones be a distraction while driving, its not worth the consequences.

What can we try to do to prevent people getting distracted by their phones while driving? The best way possible is to put your phone on silent mode, that way it will post pone all notifications until it is turned off. The second good way is to put it out of reach (glove box, trunk, etc.) that way you will have no tendency to grab it and look at for a distraction. We need to make the roads safe as possible. If you have something that is going to distract you then you are putting yourself in danger and most importantly other drivers around you. Lets just put them away while driving it will not kill you to leave it alone until you have reached your destination.

Problems in our society become self-evident as statistics show the accidents that happen due to our carelessness. The purpose of this essay is to show the reader as to why cell phones should be prohibited to be in use while conducting a motor vehicle; therefore, I will state and point out facts, statistics, and different sources to support my claim.

The first argument in my essay is the amount of damage that occurs during conducting a vehicle and using a cell phone at the same time. Throughout many years, the toll taken on by drivers has increased greatly. New statistics show up every day as to why accident are occurring on the road. This leaves an increase in death rates as motor accidents can result in injury and death. Laws have been set in place to prevent these accidents; although, there is a change in the rate of accidents, people still decide to use cellphones. A change must occur in order to lower the rates of accidents caused by cell phone use. This could be the most known and dangerous reason as to why cell phones are a harmful distraction during driving.

Although using a cell phone is harmful to a person while driving, sometimes in the case of an emergency, one must use their cell phone in order to receive calls. And to improve the chance of proper navigation through roads, navigation systems allow for easier access to reach certain locations when driving. There are many reasons as to why cell phones could be useful; however, they are greatly outnumbered by the cons. Even if it's to receive a call or text, the problem is not the cell phone itself but ones conscience to obscure their focus from the road. As this is the reason as to why accidents happen in the first place. And as much as we want to reduce these accidents, we must take a priority on to our driving by ourselves setting a restriction as to when we can use our phones while driving.

In addition to my statements, although cell phone use can benefit the driver, we must still restrict any type of use until we can lower the rates of death and accidents connected to each other. As this is the only way we can fully change the situation we are in right now. More strict laws should be placed in order to combat these dilemmas. However, this will not be an immediate change in our society as some will rebel against the new laws that should be placed to be stricter, but it is a step in the right direction and a good continuation in change the social standard of using cell phones while driving. And soon in time, we will see a change in our society all together.

In conclusion, my stance in the argument on cell phone use while drives stands where I have shown in this essay. I hope you can agree with me as to why I believe in the change this will bring to our society and change the rates in accidents making our cities, town, and roads safer for everyone. This change is a great feat that we can achieve as long as everyone is on the same page. Together we can relieve our worries of driving with care-free people driving beside us. We make our roads safer for everyone. The facts that I have stated in this essay are self-evident and require support from everyone in order to change our stands on cell phone use while driving.

Ten percent of injury crashes in 2011 were reported as being distraction-affected crashes. ""In 2011, 3,331 people were killed in crashes involving a distracted driver, while in comparison to 3,267 in 2010"". An additional 387,000 people were injured in motor vehicle crashes that involved a distracted driver, as opposed to 416,000 injuries in 2010. Texting and driving is not worth the risk of killing or injuring anyone.

Texting and driving is the most preventable type of car accident worldwide. If everyone will just put their phone up when they drive, they could prevent one more car crash. Another way to prevent texting and driving is to purchase then apply a drive cam, which records a driver's activity while in the car. Another way is to get the AT&T app called AT&T drive mode that disables the person's phone while driving so they're unable to text and drive. Most if not all texting and driving accidents can be prevented before they happen.

If your phone doesn't have any storage you can go to the AT&T website, itcanwait. com, and take the pledge not to text and drive.

Cell phones have grown into a significant part of people's day-to-day lives. Phones are primarily hand-held, which when used while driving is the cause of both minor and major road accidents. Given the importance of cell phones in people's lives, it is not practical to completely ban their use, but it makes more sense to identify safer ways to use the cellphone while driving. Numerous technologies have been developed with the purpose to make driving while using cell phones much safer like virtual assistance, speech-to-text software, and Bluetooth headsets. Practicality dictates that rules and regulations have to be designed to address hands-free cell phone. These laws will encourage safe practices, especially where fines and jail times are the consequence of breaching said laws (White, Eiser, and Harris 323). Drivers should be able to use their cell phones while driving only when hands-free, at appropriate times, and by the law.

The use of cell phones, either hand-held or hands-free, causes distractions and is dangerous to the people in the car and pedestrians. Drivers are encouraged to avoid all use of their mobile devices while on the road to ensure they are focused on driving. Nonetheless, altogether banning the use of cell phones is not helpful since phones have become a part of life. Therefore, it makes sense to identify safer ways to use cell phones while driving that do not endanger people (White, Eiser, and Harris 330). A study conducted by researchers concluded that the use of hands-free cell phone tech minimizes the time spent on the manual tasks in cell phones, particularly when compared to hand-held cell phones. Also, despite these facts, drivers are still likely to use handheld phones even though there is a safer alternative (Soccolich et al. 26).

The most effective hands-free device is the Bluetooth headset, which helps the driver answer the phone without handling it or fiddling with dials. The driver has to use the headset to both speak and listen. Furthermore, voice activation should be enabled to eliminate the need to touch the phone buttons completely. One of the best strategies, when a driver has to talk to someone, is to park the car, make the call, and switch to the Bluetooth headset, which eliminates the need to touch any controls when driving. Also, drivers can use virtual assistant software to make calls such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant (Hoy 82). When it comes to texting while driving, drivers are advised not to since it distracts from the task and can cause fatal accidents. Luckily, there are speech-to-text technologies on most smartphones that eliminate the need to hold one's phone while driving.

In conclusion, any distractions are a hazard to safe driving, including the use of both hand-held and hands-free cell phones. An appropriate solution is to identify ways in which drivers can drive while using their cellphones without unnecessarily endangering themselves or other pedestrians. Consequently, laws have to focus more on better ways to allow the use of mobile phones rather than altogether banning the use of phones while driving. Cell phones have become a significant part of people's day-to-day lives. All things revolves around staying connected via these devices. Therefore, drivers should be able to use their cell phones while driving only when hands-free and at appropriate times.

Majority of people have phones and have a vehicle that they use dailey. Should people use their phones while operating a vehicle? The answer is no people should not be able to use phones during operating a vehicle. Using phones while operating a vehicle is dangerous. The phone distracts people from doing what they need to do.

Phones are technology that people use for everything. Phones can engage a person on a high level scale to where people a lot of times don't even know what they are doing. Phones carry a lot of things for people to use like apps, social media, and face timing. All of these things on the phone distract the person using it and they are just stuck in the virtual world and they barley enjoy the real world because they are in their phones too much. These points are valid because people will use their phones while operating a vehicle.

Using phones while operating a vehicle is very dangerous for the persons safety and others. Using a phone while operating a vehicle is already illegal so that's also a main reason not to use the phone while driving a vehicle. People can not use phones during operating a vehicle because they will be too distracted and they will not pay attention to the road or area they are going to. People should not be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle it puts other people in danger and you do not want to be hit or do the hitting.

People will suffer if they use their phones while operating. Say for an example you are on your phone while driving and u hit a person with your car the first thing the cops are going to ask you, is what where you doing. And you would say i was on my phone and you would go to jail and for a long time because it's illegal to use your phone while driving. While all that is happening your going to be thinking and regretting that you pulled out your phone while driving and if you killed the person then you would probably be in jail for life and no one wants that. So people should not be able to use their phones while driving.

No one should be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle. It's illegal already you don't need any more trouble because bad consequences will happen. It's dangerous for the driver and the people around.

The phone distracts very hard to the point where the person using it doesn't pay attention in the real world. People should not be able to use phones while operating a vehicle.       ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

In the United States the number one leading cause of car accidents are caused by distracted drivers who are on their cell phones. Texting while driving has caused over 3,000 teen traffic fatalities a year. When driving it is very easy to get distracted by devices such as phones, even those who think they are more experienced get into car accidents because of texting while driving.

Society nowadays is more dependent on their devices due to the inconvenience of not knowing what is going on in their daily life. Not to mention the development of technology has been implemented on the teens of the 21st century, causing more people to find social connections through devices rather than interactions. The concern has become a negative impact to the point people are placing a person's well being, in the same comparison to one of a broken phone. The effect a device has is also impacting the mental well being of the youth, in a recent study found between the years of 2010-2015 the suicide rate on females rose to 65% while the depression rate rose by 58%. This addiction to phones has also been carried out into areas such as in cars.

According to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging. The concern about using phones while driving impacts the lives of not only themselves but also puts the lives of others at risk. Cars have become more developed over the ages to cater the needs of those who need to call by installing a bluetooth, so drivers will not open and check their phone while driving. In the past driving was in the concern of ""keeping your eye on the road"" but as time went by so did the sensibility of driving.

Phones have now become a priority even when on the road and the lack of common sense is lacking more and more over time.

Whatever reason, people have become more adapted to checking their phones while driving, thinking that 3 seconds of simply ""checking"" ,wouldn't change anything. The awareness of people driving and texting or using their phones is not impacting enough to the public. Teens are learning these bad habits and becoming accustomed to do such actions without thinking of the consequences. Thinking of how society is progressing, situations like teen accidents will not change unless the awareness of it is made more serious. In some states' they are taking the first actions to prevent accidents by adding in laws that prohibit phones to be in a driver's hand. There is nothing more serious than being able to impact someone's life by taking a brief moment to check your phone while on being in the driver seat.

In conclusion, driving is a serious matter that should be taken seriously and not as a joke. There is no greater good than taking the moment to concentrate on what is in front of you rather than what is next to you. Take caution in driving and keep both hands on the wheel to prevent anymore suffering and any harmful casualties from devices.

Putting your phone on do not disturb at all times while driving can be a safer way not causing something. Some ways to avoid texting and driving to also put your away somewhere you can not reach while driving. If the message or text is important then pull over somewhere and that won't cause anything. Texting and driving cannot be a safe way of your actions. If you know that texting while driving can be an unhealthy way to do it in the first place.

As a teenager what did you study in school? No texting and driving, right? And also that texting and driving is also the same thing as no drinking and driving, so why to do it now. Your whole life can be gone due to this little mistake. When you first had your permit were you scared to crash your parent's car? Well that the same thing here too but just that it's your own car and not theirs. On papers everywhere in the world it always tells you don't text and drive, so might mean to be safe on the road.

Drivers, in my opinion, should not be using phones at all times or even have a view of the phone while driving. I understand that if you don't know where a place is located, you have to use a GPS but you can put that while your parked and just need to hear where to go. If you are a parent of a teenager then I think you need a drive cam. A drive cam can avoid your teen of getting in a crash or something worse.

I think that texting and driving should be avoided in all states for everyone's safety. Texting and driving the reason of your own death and finish your life there. There's no way to come back if only you weren't texting. So are you going to text and drive again?

Phones have been around for quite a while now. Half of the population uses their phones while driving. People use their phones 90% of the day to talk, text, and, answer phones calls while their behind the wheel. There are some people that knows how to use their phones and drive and then it's the ones who can't focus on the road and text. 75% of the time cell phone usage behind the wheel is used because it's an important call from the office or family emergency.

Phones was introduced in 1980 and the usage of phones have sky rocket over the last two decades. It's mostly teens who use the phone and then you have some adults who use their phone just as much as teens. Teen's use their phones so much that when they get behind the wheel they forget that you can't text and drive over 4000 driving accidents happen because somebody was texting and driving. These accidents happened because they wouldn't pay attention to the road because that text was so important to them and now somebody has either died or ended up in the hospital because of them. Each year a child under the age of 18 has died because of a car accident because of texting and driving.

90% of the day somebody is driving with their phones in their hands. When you drive your main focus should be on the road and not on your cell phone. Phones are like addictions because if you haven't had your phone in your hand all day you feel lost which isn't good. If you can't take 10 minutes out the day to pay attention to the road when you get behind the wheel then you shouldn't be driving. When someone is on their phone while driving they claim they were on checking and email or answering a call and sometimes that isn't true they were texting and driving and not paying attention to the road.

There are some people out here that thinks they know how to text and drive like pro. I don't think they should be touching a wheel because having that mentality could get someone killed because they want to drive reckless. Driving while on your phones should really stop because everybody deserves to make it home to their family at the end of the day. Over these last four years phones and driving has cause a lot of deaths to the youth and it's mainly teens who do the texting and driving but some adults should take some responsibly because they do it too or they learn from so if you have your kids in the car with you while your texting and driving stop because they're going to start doing what you do because they feel like they have control over the car like you do.

So as you can see I don't agree with phones and driving it should be taken seriously because people are out here losing their life because somebody decided to pick up their phone and see who was texting them.75% of those who text while driving make it home to their families at night most don't so put down the phone for the ones who don't make it home.

Recently, Georgia has passed the ""Hands-Free"" law, which states that no driver can use their electronic devices while operating a vehicle. Although it is a law, many people still don't obey this law. Many may think that they can multitask but it's not a very good idea. Drivers shouldn't be able to use their devices while driving for many reasons. A few reasons are that many other lives are at risk, they can get a ticket and it can cause insurance rates to increase.

Depending on how much experience a driver has, they might think that they can trust themselves to multi-task. One out of Four car accidents is caused by a driver who's texting and driving. When a driver gets their phone out and isn't really paying attention to the road, they don't realize that they're putting everyone's lives in that car and many lives out on the road at risk. Car accidents can happen at any time and drivers should at least try to prevent them from happening. No driver should want to be responsible for an accident that takes their or other lives away or pays the price for their actions.

Some people may think that they can't get caught so they continue to do it. Of course, if you disobey the law there will be consequences. For texting, while driving, the fine can be up to

$150 and up to a total of one point on the driver's license. To some people, the fine isn't a problem, but getting points on a license are way worse and it affects everyone. Once points on a license add up, it can cause suspension of the license.

After those consequences, now the insurance company gets involved. When they find out that their client gets a ticket for texting and driving, they will most likely increase the insurance rate. Depending on the insurance company, they will think it's better to just cancel the policy.

Everyone's safety is important on the road. No one should risk their life or anyone's life just to send a text or check how many likes their post got. If a phone call or text message is an emergency, drivers should pull over before answering. Personally, checking it really isn't worth it because you never know what can happen on the road especially when so many people seem to be unfocused and or rushed.

A cell phone and a car, two random inanimate objects people use today for more ""convenient purposes"". They both allow us to have all the freedom in the world for us to do whatever we want. But what happens when you take the distraction from the usage of a cell phone and try applying it into driving? To say the least, a number of catastrophic possibilities could happen if we decided to take our eyes off the road. You could get pulled over and get a slap on the wrist by paying a fine while adding points to your license in the process, or get involved in a serious accident that could result in getting yourself hurt or killed while potentially doing the same to the person you hit. Either way, even a second of your attention to your phone could cost you your driver's reputation, or your life...and I should know since I myself was a victim of an incident such as this. Your life shouldn't be at risk because you chose to take your eyes off the road to check a text.

This incident happened roughly four years during the summer. I went to go get cakes for my mom and my sister for their birthday party. My friend, my brother and I decided to go get the cakes for my mom and sister from Walmart. I got the cakes as well as a few extra snacks for myself within ten minutes. It was relatively dark outside when we were driving home. Also, it didn't seem like we were going the right direction home. With that in mind, my friend decided he was going to make a u-turn somewhere and go back where we started and go home. Everything was going fine, until there was a mid sized pick-up truck cane at us at about 20 mph with a distracted driver behind the wheel. The lady that was on her phone and ended up running a stop sign while on the phone as my friend was finishing a u-turn. She hit the passenger side of my friend's car. I was in the passenger seat, and my brother was in the seat behind me and luckily, no one was seriously hurt. The most my friend and my brother suffered through was sore bones, and minor injuries. While I on the other hand, suffered a minor concussion, bleeding from the side of my head, and short term memory loss. We were all lucky to have a seatbelt on because if we didn't, things would have turned out way worse and I might not have been able to walk away from that situation.

Your life shouldn't be at risk because you took your eyes off the road to check a text.

Although driving can be relaxing and/ or fun, it can also be equally as dangerous. Getting involved in an accident while not having your seatbelt on is risky enough already. But texting and driving on the other hand, could not only get yourself hurt or killed, but the person you hit with your car as well. If you're going to use your phone while on the road purposefully, make sure you don't make your phone your main focus. Or, if you feel like you are going to use your phone purposefully, be sure to turn it off and keep it away. Because one way or another, life is inevitable, and you'll never know when death will come knocking at the door.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Have you ever really asked yourself how bad or life-threatening, texting while driving actually is? What about; actually analyzing whether it should/or shouldn't be legal or illegal for people to use their phones while driving? If you haven't already, let's take this time to thoroughly examine and /or analyze this controversial topic. Some people argue that texting while driving should be allowed because; they most likely haven't yet been in an accident while they were texting and driving. Others argue that it shouldn't be allowed for the sole reason that it is: deadly, life-threatening and scary.

Imagine being in (a) / your car doing your daily task; driving/ or going to school, work, or to run errands and suddenly you get hit from the back, the front, or the side by another car, who hit you because they were irresponsible enough to be on their phones while they were driving... traumatizing experience to even think about right? I don't know about you, but most people would agree with the most logical decision that would not only benefit but also insure our safety a little more. Research made; shows various reports that claim that, this year there has been close to '4,000 deaths' due to the distracted drivers. That's a crazy number don't you think? It's actually even been higher than that at one point. Pretty sad, I know.

Now, put yourself in the opposite position; you're the driver who so irresponsibly and recklessly is using their phone while driving... you're thinking it's no big deal to check your phone for a ""quick minute"" 'while the light's on red' or you're at a ""driving stopping point"". Then comes the part where the car in front of you, brakes and since you're too busy on your phone you don't notice and continue driving hitting the car in front of you, causing impact to both cars. This one reckless mistake can make you cause not only your life but someone else's. That one careless decision can either take your life or make you continue living a life with regrets, sadness, and trammua. Most people wouldn't bear such experience.

I know what you're thinking now; you're probably saying something to yourself like:

""ugh. I've heard that many times but it hasn't happened to me, because I'm not that reckless and I pay good attention"" but, how would you feel knowing that the odds aren't that low??? The odds of an accident happening due to using your phone while driving are insanely high, majority of the people would consider minimizing those chances by simply not using phones while driving, for the SAKE of your life, and our lives! If making it illegal to use or phones' while driving, is what it takes to keep us safe on the road and would also minimize the death rates due to 'phones and driving', then so be it, right?

We all want to live a longer and healthier life, so we can all agree that keeping/ or making the usage of our phones while driving illegal, is the best choice. In life there are only so many things we can do to prevent our deaths, that if we have the opportunity /or the solution, then we should take it and act upon it. You can always use your phone just wait those 30 minutes or however long it's going to take you because that phone and those messages, videos etc., will always be there but you can't bring a life back, you can't take that one mistake back, you can't fix things but you prevent these things. So...'stay off the phone and just look at the road'!!!      ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Texting while driving is extremely dangerous, in 2017 alone, nearly 3000 lives were claimed due to it. The NHTSA is leading a national effort to protect lives and to stop the behavior from occurring. The popularity of cellphones and other electronics has had some unintended and sometimes deadly consequences. An alarming number of traffic accidents are linked to driving while texting, including use of cell phones while driving, resulting in injury and occasionally death. Know the facts, be involved, and keep the roads safe.

Texting while driving is the act of using a cellphone while behind the wheel of a vehicle. This includes talking or texting on your phone, playing mobile games, using apps, pulling up a map; anything that takes your attention away from the task of safe driving. Using a cell phone while driving drastically increases the chances for serious accidents on the road. However, everyone can help in the cause to prevent injuries by ending texting and driving.

The first thing that can be done is to give clear instructions to new drivers. Give easy and simple instructions so they can understand. Before drivers get their licenses, tell them that diverting their eyes from the road for a few seconds could cause serious injury to someone. Leading by example is another action we can take to make the roads safer. No one should text and drive, so show others that by not doing it. If you're an example for others, they'll likely follow. Set some rules for yourself to follow and enforce them on your family.

Texting while driving is not a very responsible or smart thing to do. It can be very serious and lead to harm. Thousands of people every year are seriously injured due to texting behind the wheel. However, we can prevent it from happening, if we set rules for family, lead by example, and teach others we can help stop texting while driving. If you take a stand and make an example, we can make a difference.

A86AF111C373,"Cell Phones While Driving?

Iphones, Galaxies, Google Pixel, etc. are all major cell phone models that people spend hundreds of dollars on to get the latest release. The cell phone is no longer a ""want"" but instead a necessity to everyday life. Children are introduced to phones at a very young age as a distraction, teens use it for social media and to stay up to date with the latest trends, adults use it for work and communication. However there's a problem, we just don't know how to put it down. While eating, while in class or at work, while you are doing anything a phone is in your possession. Unfortunately, we cannot even put phones down while operating a vehicle. Using a cellphone while driving has become a harmful habit to many and has had a negative impact on society. The usage of cell phones while driving should not be allowed because it causes accidents and deaths of others, makes you less aware of your surroundings, and it gets you pulled over.

Seeing a car crash on the daily news due to a distracted driver is as common as seeing the weather man explain the upcoming forecast. Seems to have its own segment during the news broadcast. Cell phone usage while driving increases your chances of getting in an accident by four times. All it takes is a simple touch of the home button, answering a text, just the glance to your lap when it vibrates can cause you to run your car against another, potentially taking yours and others lives with you.

According to the National Safety Council, using a cellphone while driving caused about 1.5 million car accidents in the United States. Not only that, U.S. Department of Transportation reports that this act kills about 3,000 to 6,000 people every year. Some of those are innocent people who have a family waiting for them at home, but unfortunately an irresponsible driver just had to answer a text message.

People cannot understand that using your cellphones while driving not only impacts them but everyone else on the road. It has come to the point where Georgia has adopted a new law to make cell phone use out of your hands literally. The law makes it illegal to have a cellphone in your hand, hence the name hands-free. However the number of people still using their phones is pretty high. According to an article by AJC titled, ""Georgia's distracted driving law turns 1: Has anything changed?"" The State Patrol gave 22,327 distracted driving citations from July 1- May 31. It is still pretty soon to tell if the law has been a complete success but in its first year the number of fatalities in Georgia has dropped 2.2%. Just proving if people leave their phone alone while driving it would save the lives of all people in a car.

On the other hand, many people believe that their phones are needed while they drive. They could come to great use in some occasions like using it for GPS or calling for an emergency. Thus making the point to keep cell phones, but this does not eliminate the consequences the phones causes. There are more consequences towards using your phone while driving than there are benefits. Car crashes and accidents tend to happen more often when there is a phone involved, even if you are using it to find your way around.

Although there might be a few benefits to using your phone while conducting a vehicle, they should not be allowed while driving. Cell phones can have a detrimental effect on someone if they are used when in the driver's seat. The usage of a phone while driving can lead to accidents, citations, and the end of someone's life.

Do you text while driving? Well I don't think people should text while driving because it's very dangerous. You could end up hurting yourself or maybe even somebody else. There has been over 1.6 million people that died from texting while driving and there has been over 3,450 people that has been injured. You should never take your eyes off the road because it takes less than a second for a accident to happen. You never know what the person in front of you is going to do like press the breaks or something.

While you're driving, you should put your phone on DND

Should people be able to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle? Different generations would agree and disagree. Older generation would say ""No, drivers should not be able to use a phone while driving."" While newer generation would say ""Yes, drivers should be able to use a phone while driving."" I believe that drivers should not be able to use a cellular device while operating a vehicle.

Statistics state that 26% of all crashes in 2014 involved cell phone use. 10% of those crashes are teen drivers of the age 15 to 19. Teens are more likely to text and drive because their world is revolved around social media. Because teenagers are young and naïve we believe that we are more capable of multitasking but, history has shown otherwise.

Some people think they are invincible and can't be killed. So, they think can text and drive and not get hurt or face the consequences. People as they get older think they can get away with more stuff like texting and driving, but life hits them with a wake-up call.

In conclusion, do you think drivers should be able to use their cell phone while driving? People need to keep their eyes on the road and on nothing else. They need to stay focused to their surroundings. Texting and driving kills, so be careful on the roads.                       ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Throughout the recent years and the invention of ""the smartphone people"" utilized the technology to keep in contact with family and other people around the world.

This is called ""Texting and Driving"", a word that is collaborated with ""Drinking and Driving"" where people would be under the use of alcohol while operating a vehicle, but texting and driving is applied that the driver is using their phone while driving causing the driver to be distracted from keeping their eyes on the road.

9AFD0FE015E6,"Phones and Driving Essay

There are two items people in the world can't wait to get. A car and a phone. Both are very much needed on today's day and age. A car to get you to where you need to go, and, a phone to contact people. But let me say this, they both DO NOT go well together.

My first reason for why people should not be able to use their phones while they drive is that it is dangerous. You are driving a metal box going 60+ miles down the road. There's nothing to stop you from turning slightly to the right and hitting a two-ton semi-truck or going to the left and coming into oncoming traffic. You need to keep 100% attention to the road just in case some maniac does decide to do that or if someone slams on brakes in front of you. Using your phone while driving takes some of that attention off from the road which is dangerous to yourself and other drivers around you.

Now what are the benefits of texting and driving? Texting someone back? Posting a snapchat on time? The dangers of texting and driving far outweigh the benefits. Now the most leading cause of death for teenage drivers is texting and driving according to www. integrityinsurance. com. That text or that snap can wait till you get home.

My final reason for why you shouldn't text, and drive is that it is illegal. If all the reasons I explained earlier could not get you to stop then maybe this will. If you are seen texting and driving by a police officer, you can get in various amounts of trouble according to which state you are in. In some states it is a fine that ranges from 50-500$. In other states it can result in criminal misdemeanor charges or and evil jail time.

Now that you have heard my reasons for how texting and driving is dangerous and even deadly, you too need to take a stand. Tell a friend or family member that you know texts and drives that they need to stop. Now.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6
3554F11FFE6E,"I strongly believe that drivers should not be able to use cellular devices while operating a vehicle. For one it causes accidents, secondly it could cause them trouble and create problems on their end, and last but not least it's a Georgia rule. There's almost one thousand accidents every day due to driving while being on a cellular phone, in fact that's how a lot of people lose their close ones. These are my reasons on why I feel that drivers should not be able to use any type of device while operating a mobile vehicle.

You could be having one of the best days in your life, and all it takes is one look down and that could be your life right at that moment. Texting and driving has one of the highest death rates any one has ever seen. Think about whom ever else life your putting in danger just by looking down at your phone. It may cause you to react, then once you react to the situation it may cause somebody else to panic, and just like that everything's out of place. Honestly you would strongly regret the problem that you could cause so let's put the phones down.

Playing with a mobile device could truly hurt you at your own sakes. Imagine driving down the freeway, and then you end up in a ditch. Maybe even just running into somebody in a head on collision all because you look down for a hot second. Next the cops would have to get involved, your family would be hurt, or even the family of the victim. This could create problems for yourself. It could create something so big you wouldn't even want to drive anymore, or maybe even make you paranoid. Keeping the phones away saves a life every day.

Last be not least texting while driving is an officially a state law. You don't want to cause problems for yourself just because you wanted to text you friend back. I'm pretty sure your dreams and ambitions are way more important that sitting behind bars because of a stupid text message. It wouldn't even be necessary, to have to pay a large few for a ticket, or even have to attend court when you could just have put it down until you got to your destination. So let's obey the laws and do what's right.

In conclusion I know that we have talked about, the trouble cellular devices can cause. It's something that I feel we just shouldn't be allowed to have when driving, it causes consequences and way too much other commotion. Think about not only your safety but others before you make a call or shoot a text. It all lies on you and the decisions you make, just rely on the right ones to keep you from tickets, and trouble.

185FD725317F,"Should or Shouldn't drivers use devices while operating a vehicle? I think drivers shouldnt use any device while operating a vehicle. The reason being is because you can put yourself and others in serious danger. You using a device when you should be paying attention to the road can cost so much damage to things and others. No person should use no device especially if they have a child on board during driving time. You wouldn't want to hurt your child due to this dangerous thing to do. This type of thing had cost many car accidents which is likely 45% to happen of most accidents made because of the use of devices.

If you want to be able to use any device while driving , I think you should get something that's safer to use during your time of driving. Having a phone holder so that you wouldn't have to take your eyes off the road at any given moment . It's safe to use because you can still manage your driving and what you are trying to do on your device at the same time. You can still make phone calls and such things of that nature. A little more in depth on why this is still a dangerous thing to do. Many people that drives like teens the ages like 17 and older attend to use devices while toxicated or other things pertaining to that. This is more dangerous to use a device because you are unaware of everything going around you.

This is why most teens or adults have many accidents because of driving using a device while driving. While learning to drive there were no things saying to use a device while driving. You don't think about other lives while doing these dangerous things? To me I don't think so because therefore no accidents wouldn't be made because of this type of thing. I think if people did care everyone wouldn't use a device at all unless it's a safe device to use which is a blue tooth device. People need to follow rules more so that these things can be avoided. When you follow rules they stop a lot of things from preventing car accidents.

I think people who use a device while driving and they cost a accident should have a serious consequence. They know on the road no device shouldn't be used because of what can happen to yourself and others around you. So when it happens they should get the full consequence that is because these things need to stop because people want to do things at the wrong given time. So this what should happen if the person are in the wrong.

This is why I think devices shouldn't be use during operating a vehicle because of all the things that can happen in my previous paragraphs.

Us humans are getting to the point where; all we use is technology. While we are driving, we are either on the phone with someone or either like what teens use now, there on snap recording something.

Reason 1 drives should not use a cell phone while operating a vehicle. It is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes. Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash.

Reason 2, Reports have that 1.6 million crashes are caused because drivers text and drive. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone.

Cell phones have been very popular lately in car crashes, most of the time in a car crash the reason is always because one of the people operating the vehicle are on their phone.

Driving while texting causes car wrecks. You could be going down a road with no cars and suddenly you hit a tree, a light pole or even a building. Just because you're on your phone and not paying attention to the road. Someone could be running out to your car yelling for help while you're driving and suddenly you hit them. You get out your car your car is messed up and they are laying in the road unconscious.

Not only is someone injured, but you are now responsible for trhe financial difficulties they will face in the future.

Your phone is not more important then you're safety on the road. Your safety on the road is more important than a phone. You can always get another phone, but you can never get another life from a bad car wreck. Most car wrecks involve death. Think about your life before getting on a phone. Instead of you paying attention to the road you want to be on social media looking at things that doesn't concern you. Your car could be gone and your life. All because you want to be on your phone.

Driving while on your phone can also cause you to pay for someone else car because you were in the wrong by being on your phone. You could be the reason why that person loses their life and end up in jail. Your freedom is more important then you are risking your life and doing time for a phone.

Out of nowhere this little boy was walking home, and she hit him. The little boy lost his life and she went to jail all behind that. His parents were depressed that he was gone. You should never pick up your phone while driving because anything could happen.

In all states you are not allowed to text and drive nor eat while driving because someone could get hurt. If you get pulled over by talking on the phone or texting, you automatically go to jail. 20% of drivers get pulled over just for being on their phones and not watching the road. Some officers let people off with a ticket warning. Your ticket may be about the price of 200-300 dollars. Don't risk your time in jail just because you didn't want to listen. Do what's right.

In conclusion texting and driving is bad. Don't text and drive at the same time. Add a little more detail here. Just because you don't see anything in your way, if you look down at your phone, you can easily have a car wreck. Someone can die just because if you want to be on your cell phone.

In our everyday life we always have a cell phone either in our hand or right next to us. In this society we have grown to use our cell phones for everything we do. It has become our everyday usage. I believe drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle as it can be distracting and cause many accidents.

The cause of many accidents is due to people using their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Many people think if you just look down on your phone for a second no harm will be done. Well that is not the case, all it takes is one second for your life to change. You have to think if that text is worth it and think of all the possible outcomes from just doing that. It is best to put your phone on, do not disturb and have your phone out of your sight. Not only should you think about yourself but the other people on the road. Car accidents can cause death to many people with that one second distraction. A lot of times when people do use their phone while driving it was not even worth it, so again think if it is worth the pain you can cause others.

Driving consists of you having your eyes on the road at all times to ensure everyone is safe. Phone usage while operating a vehicle is a distraction to not just yourself but to others. Many states have laws on using your phone while driving. In Georgia it is prohibited. This can decrease the amount of car accidents that happen on the road. In fact, it has decreased the numbers in many states when they force this law in. People who are not multi taskers also can cause a lot of harm in the road for people as they can not do more than one thing at once.

There are many reasons why people use their cell phone while driving but the only valid reason is when they're using the gps. There are still many cars that do not have a built in gps system so it leads people to use their phones to guide them to their destination. Which still is not a good excuse. They can always listen to what the gps is saying without looking at their phone. Many people feel they need to see it visually in order to follow it. Uber drivers use their phone at all times when they're on the clock. Their whole work is operated on a phone but many usually have a phone holder if they believe they need to visually see it.

In conclusion, I believe drivers should not be able to use their phone while driving. As I explain it can lead to many accidents and distract you on what's important which is the road. You are not only harming your safety but others. So before you think about using your phone ask yourself is it worth it.

Gas and fire don't mix, so why should cell phones and the operation of a vehicle. In the essay I will be expressing my thoughts on using a cell phone while operating a vehicle. You will learn the statistics of how the majority of car crashes are caused by cell phones. I will discuss how cell phones can cause reckless driving. We will discuss ways to prevent ways of crashing while using your cell phone.

The statistics show that nearly 1.6 million crashes happen every year. Every year within those crashes 390,000 people are injured. One out of four times those crashes happen is from texting. I have a story to go along with the statistics.

A friend of mine was driving to go to the gym. On his way to the gym his father kept calling him, but he refused to use the phone while he was driving. So his dad kept calling and he thought it must be urgent. So he picked up the phone to call him back and within the first 30 seconds he crashed. Luckily it was just a minor crash and he was alright. That just goes to show you how distracting they are.

Besides speed, the most common reason for reckless driving is caused by cell phones, mainly texting. Driving requires your undivided attention, but when you're texting you're giving over half of your attention to your phone. Yes there is a hands free law that you can use but your phone still needs your attention to use the hands free law. It's like my friend's story he didn't pick up, but once he did he wrecked.

You should never be using your phone while driving. It could harm not only yourself but others too. that is why it is so important to be safe and not even think about touching your phone. All of your focus should just stay on the road.

Do you think the driver of a car should be allowed to use his/her phone while driving? When it comes to being allowed to have a phone behind the wheel a lot of things must come into play before it can be considered a good idea. There are a lot more cons to something like this than there are pros but the pros should definitely be taken into consideration. The best way to figure out if it is a good idea is to know everything someone requires to drive at full capacity. What we will cover is the pros and cons of drivers being allowed to use their phones while behind the wheel.

First I would like to talk about the cons of something like this being allowed. Cell phone usage while driving is common but it is really considered dangerous due to the potential of causing distracted driving and crashes. Many agree that use of cell phones while driving is pervasive. ""Drivers on a cell phone reduce their visual scanning of the road ahead, and are more likely to weave within their lane on bends, and are slower to respond to hazards.""

As stated in the text above if drivers take their eyes off of the road it is more than likely they will have accidents.

As I said before there are a lot more pros to phones being allowed to be used behind the wheel. Cell phones allow users to call for immediate help when needed and cell phones allow people to have directions for when they cannot find their destinations. Many local governments provide traffic updates for people with cell phones so that they can try to avoid traffic making their trip quicker. Cell phones also allow users to immediately call the police to report suspicious actions they see while driving. With all this being taking into account there are some good things that can be achieved allowing drivers the use of their cell phones.

In conclusion, I would say there are some benefits to being able to use cell phones while driving but the chances of an accident happening significantly increase at an alarming rate. Do I think drivers should be allowed cell phone use? I do believe they should be allowed but only when they are not at risk of putting themselves or anyone in harm's way. Although studies show that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. I purpose that drivers should not be allowed to text while driving but everything else of course.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Using cell phones while driving has a big impact on car wrecks, I believe that cell phone usage while operating a motor vehicle should be prohibited because they play a big part in distracting the driver.

One reason cell phone usage should be prohibited is because when one is looking in their cell phone they usually look down and look back up but anything could happen in a split second leading to an immediate reaction without thought. According to studies and statistics ""Almost 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving"". Meaning out of all of the accidents that happen yearly 390,000 are due to texting and driving which could easily be prevented, just wait to send that text.

Another reason cell phone usage should be prohibited is because it takes up time, the time you're using to send that one text or make that one call could be time used to get where you're going. The use of a cell phone while driving is inconsiderate of other drivers, it takes up their time as well. When people use their cell phones they only think of themselves, imagine if the driver behind you were in danger and you're using your phone wasting time at the green light. Most people don't put themselves in other people's places, yet things that you do can have an effect on another's personal life. If this was you in danger would you want someone driving slow in front of you because of their cell phones that they could check when they arrive to where they are going?.

Next, cell phones could cause anybody to do reckless driving. You could be on any social media and try to see what's going on in everybody else life instead of your own. Social media could wait on you until you get home. Cell phones cause reckless driving which cause accidents that could be prevented only if you waited those seconds. You never know what someone might say about you on social media, and you could get caught up in the drama. Driving while mad isn't a good mix. You could take your anger out while driving extremely fast then boom you crash.

Furthermore, you're not paying attention to your driving, and road signs. Besides the green light there are more road signs. Like what if you were on your phone and you don't see the sign that signals a deaf child is alert. Then a deaf child was crossing the street, and you crash into them. This could be murder, and soon you'll be there locked up rotting in jail. Somethings are meant to be considered before you pick up your phone and text while driving. Most accidents could be avoided if you wouldn't be so careless about others. In a passage it stated ""Cell phones aren't the reason why there are car accidents."" This isn't accurate because based on my research at least 88% of people die from car accidents.

In conclusion cell phones should be prohibited while driving. Most accidents can be caused by using a cell phone while driving. Think about a consequence that could come with your actions while using your cell phone, neither the less it can wait. There could be an occurring accident that could be prevented all if you would be careful and mindful of people. You should consider putting your phone on airplane mode while driving. It will make driving more easier and safer for you and the people you are surrounded by.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Do you think drivers should use their phones while operating a vehicle? Do you think it is safe to be on your phone while driving? Well in this essay I will be explaining why I don't think drivers shouldn't operate a vehicle while driving.

Many accidents occur when drivers get on the road and are distracted by their phones. A lot of people had their life taken away from them when people were driving and being on the phone. Too young adults, too adults we all have been guilty for being too addicted to our phone including me but it is a time and a place to be on your phone and not to be on your phone. As a young adult, I know and understand the risk of driving and being distracted by my phone. Many cases have been reported on the death of people who were texted and driving. I know sometimes you want to send out the text message to your friends or your loved one. I know you want to check your email to see if you got hired for the job you want. however, you shouldn't be on your phone while trying to drive. That is highly dangerous for you and the other person who is driving in the next car.

You should be focused on the road, not on your phone because it can only take one look away from the road to cause a serious car accident that can do two things death or put you in a critical injury .using your phone can cause serious damage while driving because you are trying to do two things at one time. Let me explain when you're driving you should be focusing on the road nothing else because you can't be on be focusing on two things at the same time that's is impossible. another reason is that there are some people, not all that drive crazy and that's don't pay attention to the other car they drive fast and don't care about the other people driving. So while driving you have to focus on more than one thing and I know that people probably say that""

but I have always been on my phone when I am diving all the time and I haven't been in an accident"". that might be the case, however, it doesn't guarantee that it will not happen. in reality, it only takes one time for something that can change your life forever. These days there is a law for that now and police are locking up people for that or giving them a ticket. But what if you were the unfortunate ones that died because the police didn't catch you on your phone?

In conclusion, if you don't want to be in jail for killing someone because you're distracted then you can pull over to send that text, check your Instagram or your email. Your life and freedom are more important than the people on your phone. even if you don't feel like going that then have someone else in the car with you who can drive so that you can check/reply to your text message. does it have to take you to kill someone to learn the lesson?

18A9BCAC0886,"Cellphones are a part of everyone's day to day life. We find out information, contact others, even kill time using these tiny little computers. It sometimes seems like we couldn't survive without such an essential device, but in reality it may cause more harm than good especially if used in the wrong situations. The ""National Safety Council"" reports that there are more than 1.6 million crashes every year due to texting and driving. It has become one of the nations highest causes of death. Almost every state in America has banned it and in some eye's it should be enforced more than it is. The use of your cellphone while driving is extremely dangerous and should not be allowed or even accepted in society.

While driving at the speed of 55mph if you close your eyes for even 5 seconds then you've already driven the distance of a football field. Now imagine that every time someone looks down at their phone to read or respond to a text for 5 seconds they have already endangered all the other people that were in that football field's length of road. Although it may seem very minor at first to just look down for a second, it is very dangerous. Even though in some situations it may seem like it's an emergency and you need to reply at that moment, it is always safer to pull over and deal with it then. Risking other people's lives is not something that should be taken lightly.

With how updated and modern our technology is now a day's, there should be absolutely no reason to text and drive. New technologies have given the ability to use your phone hands free and be able to text or call without ever looking away from the road. In Georgia there was a law implemented that requires every driver to have this hands free system set up in their car. This in return has caused many drivers to put the phone away and just use the vocal features. The hands free law has saved many people's lives but there are still many phone users behind the wheel.

To sum this up, texting and driving is very dangerous. Putting others lives at risk or even your own just to send that couple word text is not worth it. There are many ways of avoiding this problem, like simply pulling over, or using bluetooth and letting the information be told over the air. Many people would feel safer on the roads and maybe even take in some of their surroundings and be more alert. If this was taught to young teenagers before they got their driver's license then many of their crashes would have been avoided.    ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Phones are everywhere in today's society with all different versions of a phone but the biggest problem is using your phone while driving. Drivers should not use their phones while driving to any location and they are many reasons why. One of the reasons is that you have a higher risk of crashing. Another reason is that it can be a huge distraction and it can keep your eyes off the road. And the last reason is that you are mostly to be found at fault for an accident. It is illegal to text and drive in the state of Georgia.

You should avoid using your phone while driving at all times.

Using your phone while driving gives you a higher chance of crashing than getting lost while driving. Everyone knows that you have to pay for insurance and no wants to pay extra money after they collided with another car. In this society, we focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can not put down our phones while we are driving. Not only do you put yourself in danger, but you put innocent people in danger too. You want to live your life to the fullest and not try to lose it early.

Using your phone can be a huge distraction when driving. That's why it is now illegal to hold your phone while driving in the state of Georgia. Drivers can no longer have phones touching any part of their body while talking through your phone. Taking eyes off the road while driving is one of the first lessons that is taught to a driver in his early driver's education.

Keeping your eyes off the road is very dangerous and no one should be distracted while driving.

Having your eyes off the road to check your phone for any calls or messages can lead up to an accident and can harm people.

If you get into an accident and you were on your phone, you can be blamed for the cause of the accident. Not only is it illegal to use your phone while driving but you can spend time in jail for using your phone. If you get into an accident and the other driver wasn't looking where they were going or wasn't following the rules then they are the reason why you got into an accident. Many young teens get into a situation where they hit a car because they didn't look straight ahead and put their eyes down to look at their phone.

In conclusion, phones shouldn't be used while driving. If people gave up using their phones then the number of fatalities will decrease and people will feel safe driving down the road. It is our responsibility to keep our friends and family safe on the road and anywhere we go.                               ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Danger has fascinated humans for centuries. So has technological advancements or just technology in general. Cell phones are a wonderful thing just like driving is a wonderful thing but like an open flame and gasoline, who said they should go together? Texting while driving has led to way too many deaths. While common sense should tell you not to deviate attention form the road where you're not just driving for yourself but for everyone else, people still do it even though they shouldn't.

People shouldn't text and drive because deviating your attention from something serious can only end up bad. If you were hiding from Jason Voorhees, scared for your life, would you watch a YouTube video? Of course not, because you are focused on staying safe. Driving should be treated the same way because one bad decision could result in a multicar collision and someone dead.

In the state of Georgia, there is a law against a driver being on their phone because of the reasons stated in the previous paragraph. There is also a fine of $150.00 as a punishment. That's better that being a number in the 1.6 million people who die every year due to texting a driving. Or the better case would be just not being on your phone and texting in the first place. Wouldn't you agree?

The final way to stop these fatalities is to put your cell phone in driving mode. Newer model cars with the Bluetooth feature allow this feature to be enabled.

That feature blocks all notifications until you are out of the vehicle. That makes it safe for the driver by taking their mind of their phone and helps others by keeping the drivers mind focused on the road.

That's a true definition of safety first.

Driving is a privilege has always been true but it matters more and more every year as more people get distracted by the newest feature on their phone. Whatever is on Instagram can't be more important than your life. As more people replace their cars for the newest car that Bluetooth feature will be widely available to more people.

Over the years, phones have developed to be an important thing in our life. Phones are apart of our everyday lives and sometimes we think we can't live without. We are afraid that we will miss something important if we don't use our phones, we must use our phones all the time even if it means putting ours lives in danger. In this essay, I will be talking about why nobody should use their phone in any way while operating a vehicle.

Now a days, it is very tempting to use your phone any opportunity you get. Especially if you're in a vehicle and the vehicle comes to a red light. However, under any circumstances you shouldn't touch your phones because of the many dangers it can cause. Smartphones have a lot of new features to insure nobody uses their phone behind the wheel. Iphone's have a do not disturb while driving feature that was introduced last year. The feature silences/limits phones calls and text messages and you will not see the notifications until you have reached your destination. The feature automatically turns on when your phones detects that you might be driving.

There are many dangers to using your phone behind the wheel. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. One of the dangers of your using your phone while driving is not being completely focused on the road. When you are not completely focused on the road, you can miss a lot of things. You can miss things like other cars turning, cars trying to enter you same lane.

Anybody any age can be tempted to use their cellphone while driving. According to the teensdriversource. org, In 2017 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,166 were killed in 2,935 distraction- affected crashes. Accounting for 9 percent of all fatal crashes in the United States. The best way to avoid using your phone while driving is texting or calling anybody that you may think may contact you and tell them that you are about to drive and will get back to them when you arrive at your destination. Connect your phone to the car Bluetooth and use the buttons on the steering wheels to change the music or radio. Also set your phone inside the glove compartment so you won't be tempted to touch your phone in anyway.

In conclusion, I believe that anybody any age shouldn't be use their phone while operating any vehicle. It can cause many dangerous things. Not only to you but to others also. Always remember that everybody's life is important including yours. So the text/call can wait intill after you arrive.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Driving has become an everyday thing to citizens. Although many find popular to use their phones why driving. This is a bad example to children. Many people have died by getting ran over, or by car accidents. Sadly, drivers don't think about that when using technology while on wheels. Some states are already putting to work a hands free law, in which drivers are not allowed to use their technology while driving.

First of all, technology is affecting drivers; it is developing problems to society.

Technology has become an addiction that can lead to deaths. It's a distraction to all drivers. It's also a distraction because it can distract you from seeing the speed limit which makes you get tickets. Some phone companies have come up with some potential solutions. The Apple company has a ""Do Not Disturb While Driving"" this makes your phone block all messages and phones while you're in a moving car.

Second of all, driving causes deaths. The first cause of death is by automobiles. Children, adults, and creatures get run over every single day. Pedestrians who ride bicycles, walk or drive motorcycles are at greater risk of getting hit or run over than people who ride cars. Most car accidents occur at night because they are more likely to fall asleep or use their phones. This is likely to happen to adults and children under the age of twenty-five.

Corresponding, to some many deaths by car Georgia came up with the Georgia Hands Free Law also known as bill six seventy-three. It states anyone who is found or seen with a phone while driving will be stopped. Civilians can make calls and answer them by using a car cradle. This law was passed to reduce traffic crashes. After the law was passed they saw a decrees in car accidents and in deaths by mobiles.

In conclusion civilians should not be able to use the phone while driving. It could save a life when your being safe and not using your phone while driving. Not texting and driving can prevent many future inconvenience with the law. If you don't want to get a ticket and spend time in jail you shouldn't use your phone while driving.

Texting while driving is a continuous topic and a very debated one. Some people believe that texting is okay while driving but I'm here to argue that it's not. People all over the world have died or gotten injured due to sending a short text or even looking at their phone. Not only does texting and driving put your life in danger it also puts the people around you at risk. When operating a vehicle, we always need to keep our eyes on the road.

Texting while driving should be illegal

""The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving."" source from EdgarSnyder. com says. However, when you're operating a vehicle you should not distract yourself for harm to come your way or another's. Many families; mothers, fathers, and children die due to car crashes and the leading cause is texting. Many children grow up in a home without their mother or father because of a simple text.

In the state of Georgia, last year a girl was going down the highway playing on her phone and got into a car accident, ended up killing her friend and was sentenced to 15 years 3 years in prison and 12 years of probation for murder. There are many consequences from texting and driving, I can either be as small as a ticket or as far as death and prison time. The death over texting while has increased over the years. Mothers and fathers should not be burying their children.

However, some people will try to debate that they need their phone, or it was important, and it very may well have been, but if it wasn't an emergency then there is no reason to be on their phone. Everybody has the choice to pull over if they want to be on the phone. Quick example, most people can't even walk and chew gum and think that they can drive and text. Although it's not just texting while driving, I feel as though you shouldn't be on your phone while on the road period. Many people die from texting and walking into the street and not looking.

Operating a car can be dangerous enough therefore you shouldn't put your life in more danger by using a phone. A text will be there when you park your car. Imagine it being your son or daughter that gets killed because someone was texting while driving, so why put others or yourself in danger like that? Why put your freedom on the line like that?

Upon the development of handheld computers, more commonly known as ""smart phones,"" the question arises whether, when driving, they are a necessity or a deterrent. Both sides of the argument induced by this question are accurate in some way and folly in another; and so there will always be debate over the subject, with both sides just as right and just as wrong as the other for different reasons. To elaborate upon this further, one might argue that phones should not be allowed in motorized vehicles while they are being operated due to the implication of a distraction. On the other hand, however, one might also argue the necessity of GPS and availability for work. Some laws are put in place to help prevent accidents through negligence because of the need to sometimes carry a device; the only trouble is that people abuse the rights they do have and many can be found texting or holding a phone up to their ear with only one hand or nothing but their knee on the steering wheel. Not only do those drivers have less control of the steering wheel, but they also often get distracted by conversation and drive recklessly. These individuals are the ones the counter argument against phones in motor vehicles will often refer to. The argument about phones and driving is controversial to say the least, and while often neglected it is important to carefully analyze all factors contributing before speaking or constructing an argument or opinion about the subject.

Cell phones did not exist when cars were first beginning to be produced on a massive scale in 1908 with Henry Ford's Model T, and wouldn't exist for another sixty five years after its development. Laws were never necessary for the implication of cellphones because they did not yet exist, but when cellphones were invented they, in certain cases, became a real problem for people on the road. Since then the cell phone has advanced in an amazing way, rather than a big brick . The first computer was a enormous invention, large enough that one could easily fill an entire room. Today, we have advanced so much on the principle of the computer that we have eventually developed a hand held portable computer that is now in everybody's pockets. Also to be noted is that the first cellular phone was by no means the super computers they are today; they too were big and bulky, and were only good for making phone calls like an ordinary telephone. These amazing advancements have become the very necessities we rely on today, the great majority of which developed only in recent years, and are now staples of modern society.

The most controversial subject outside of laws already put in place about cell phones and driving is manner of necessity, and manner of liability.

There is no one correct party in this argument, because there is always a valid and considerable counter argument to every point which can be made on either which side; wherefore every argument which can be made is only a half truth. The folly of individuals on both polarities of the argument is the inability to understand the importance or reason behind any opinion that in any way opposes their own. The fact of the matter is, neither of which party is entirely correct in their accusations based on the bias of their opinion on the subject. Cell phones are an important and useful tool, whether you need to carry one at all times for work or simply the convenience of having a device with which you can get ahold of outside sources in dire conditions and utilize the availability of GPS if needed. People should most certainly keep their cell phones with them while their driving; but people are often known to abuse this right by recklessly focusing on their device at unnecessary times when driving. To utilize your device properly is the best option rather than to follow each extreme of all or nothing, but the problem still stands and will always stand for the sheer fact that motorized vehicles and cell phones simply exist that there will be those who will not follow this code of conduct, despite any laws which could be implemented.

The general population needs to be encouraged somehow to go about their business responsibly. Unfortunately, this is next to impossible to achieve by any conceivable means on a large scale, and certainly impossible to convince every individual entirely. This will always be a problem in society with any and all causes, and it is up to the rest to withhold these laws and maintain both order and safety. The only thing people can truly do to resolve a situation where somebody is recklessly driving due to negligence while texting or otherwise using their mobile device, is to report the incident to law enforcement for the safety of other individuals on the road. Motorized vehicles are a wonderful utility but they are unsafe, accidents can happen simply by not being careful and often result in death or serious injury.

The best and only thing we can do is to just drive with caution and alertness at all times, especially considering that people are unpredictable and anything can happen on the road.

Using phones while driving has been a argument for what seems like forever. In my opinion using phones while driving will always lead to some type of horrific life changing , accident. Not many people consider all of the awful stories real people have went through involving a driver using their cellular on the road. Using your phone on the road should be taken as seriously as drinking and driving or being under the influence of any drug. Being on your phone can cause families to lose a loved one , a person to be completely disabled for life, and it puts yourself in danger along with others on the road.

In several different states all over the U.S they put laws that prohibit using your phone while driving. Alabama enforces the drivers age 16 and 17 who have held intermediate licence for less than 6 months cannot have a cell phone on them at all while driving. California bans all school and transit bus drivers and younger than 18 from being on their cellular while on the road.

Colorado however only punishes drivers younger than 18 who are caught on there phones while driving. Many of these states have different regulations to the safety on the road. But majority 47 states ban texting and driving for all drivers.

For those who figure texting and driving isn't ""that"" serious or consider themselves master multi taskers , no one knows when something can change forever over the slightest glance. There's been story after story about people losing family members, best friends, partners over that slight glance to their cell phone. People are so naive till it happens to them , but why , we should be preventing that from happening at all costs. No one wants to go through all that pain and guilt. Not only could you disable yourself you can also kill and disable another and have to live with the guilt for the rest of your life.

Using your GPS would be the only acception to using your cell while driving ,but even then you don't need to look or have it in your hand. There has been devices made for your car for those specific moments. Today's cars will read your text out loud to you and give you your directions there's no reason to look at your phone.

Despite of the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to text snap call etc. Also, they believe that hand-free set is safe because they can drive and not focus on the cell phone. However, they say that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support cell phones usage while driving, there are cases that they are dangerous, and people should avoid talking while driving.

Some people whose work rely on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Some business issues can be stressful and cause driving to be dangerous while talking about that situation a person may react differently which can cause an accident. The conversation they're can lower their driving ability if they get upset which can lead to you not focusing and losing control over the car. If people don't make a smart decision to not text and drive in their daily routine, they can put others at risk of losing their life.

Opponents claim that hands-free set is safer than using your phone because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and also suggesting that the behavior is safe. Research shows that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a cell phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists say that people talking over the phone to another person doesn't interfere with driving. The issues come is when a car suddenly Vere's of the road or into pedestrian traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So, the problem isn't focusing on the road and using the cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of a lack of smarts, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particular time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call-in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it in the accident how can they reach or find it if they are flipped over in their car.

These are just a few reasons for why drivers should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

In 2015, the NSC estimated that cell phone use while driving, alone, accounted for 27% of all car crashes in the United States and 25% of all motor vehicle crash fatalities. Also in 2015, there were 3,477 people killed and an estimated additional 310,000 people injured in accidents involving distracted driving. In the U.S. nine people are killed each day from distracted driving. Car crashes are the number one killer of teens in the U.S. This distraction is responsible for more than 58% of teen crashes. These statistics rise every year. And with technological advances in cars, radios, phones, etc., there are many things that can easily distract any driver. Drivers should keep in mind that it is okay to leave a text unread for a couple of minutes in order to safely respond when the vehicle is stopped and off the road. Or pull over if it is important to respond quickly. There is rarely an emergency so severe and emergent that a person would need to put themselves and others at risk of serious injury or even death, because if something happens to that person, they can not help in an emergency situation anyway.

Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

In concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

It has become a common practice today for many people to use their phones while driving. They try to be as efficient as possible with their time and see no problem with trying to multitask when operating a vehicle. Some text on their phones while others may take calls or check emails. In no regard is this a safe practice and drivers should not be allowed to use a phone under any circumstance as it only amount to a more dangerous driving environment.

Often times crashes are the result of distracted driving. This usually occurs in teenage age groups who have a commitment to checking their phones while driving. Teenagers assume that by taking their eyes off of the road for solely two seconds, they aren't putting themselves or anyone else in danger. In reality, distracted driving via cell phone use ""reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent,"" (""Cell Phones""). Taking calls or texting confidently reduces a driver's ability to control a vehicle, respond to driving events, and direct attention to the roadway. This isn't the case for just teenagers. These conditions apply to every driver who attempts to use their cell phone while driving, thus creating a dangerous driving environment. People often drive with family members, close friends, or children in the car. The chance of a fatal crash because of distracted driving is high and it is very possible that these family members, close friends, and children could be injured or worse. It is much safer to restrict all phone use while driving in order to ensure that roadways remain safe. By not using a cell phone, a driver is better able to pay attention, less likely to crash, and following the law (""Cell Phones"").

Many states have already offered consolation for the distracted driving problem in the United States. For instance, Georgia enacted Joshua's Law in 2007 requiring 16 year old drivers to complete driver's ed. The state also recently approved the Hands-Free law, which in essence eliminated any and all distracted driving practices. States recognize the problems that come with cell phone use while driving and have taken steps to fix them. This is evidence enough that in no way, shape, or form should drivers be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. For further support, there are about 9 people killed and 1,000 injured daily in the United States because of distracted driving (""The Dangers of Distracted Driving""), thus the popularity of cell phone use while driving is a damaging practice in the U.S. and should be ended immediately. Although cell phones may be used in a beneficial manner while driving, such as GPS use, crime reporting, or roadside assistance, it is a more viable and safe practice to prohibit its use until a person it not behind the wheel of a vehicle. A person only puts themselves in more danger, even when doing something appropriate with a cellphone when operating a vehicle, by trying to utilize it and maintain focus on the road at the same time.

In sum, it is in the most obvious interest of all drivers that cell phone use while driving be prohibited in any way or form. It is a dangerous practice that puts family, kids, and friends in immediate danger. Any benefits that are noted of cell phone use while driving are miniscule compared to the risk one takes by even looking at a phone for two seconds. Considering states have had enough common sense to begin a prohibition of the practice in favor of all drivers' safety, it is more than adequate to say that drivers should in no manner be given the opportunity to contribute a fatal driving environment by using a cell phone.

I believe no one should be on their cell phone or electronic devices while driving for their safety and their peers safety. When texting while driving could cause you to get to focused on your conversation on the phone and causes you to not pay attention on the road and the driver might end up driving off of the road into another lane, hitting another car, and etc when you can just wait until you reach your destination.

Mobile phone use while driving is common but it can be very dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashing . in addition to voice calling , activities such as texting while driving , playing video games , or just basic phone use can still cause crashes.

In the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones

In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day, while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. In a number of cases it has been shown that bans on mobile use while driving have proven to be an effective way to deter people from picking up their phones. Those violating the ban usually face fines and points on their licence. Although an initial decrease/alteration in driving habits is to be expected. As time goes on the number of people breaking these laws/regulations eventually goes back to normal, sometimes higher levels as time goes on and people go back to their old habits. In addition, police officers have difficulties detecting mobile phone use in vehicles, which decreases the effectiveness of bans/restrictions on mobile phone.

However, the hands free rule really isn't safe either because that can still cost a crash. Now to summarize this all i think having phones while driving isn't safe.            ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Should drivers be able to use their phones while textng and driving?

No,they should not, a total of 47 states has banned the use of electronic devices of any kind, in 2013 around 3,154 people were killed and an estimated of 424,000 hurt in a motorcycle accidents due to people being distracted by their phones. Phones seem to have more control over cars than people driving them do.

In 2010 a phone company called ""at&t'' started a campaign that has over 20 million pledges with a simple phrase ""distracted driving is never ok"".

Some of the pledges states; how mistakes were made and now they are dealing with the consequences and how they affected their lives in various ways both, physically and mentally. For example, a 16 year boy was hit by a car who says he was texting his girlfriend that was sitting next to him the whole time. Yeah distracted driving is very much not ok.

Texting while driving is not taken lightly in any state. In fact in mississippi a man was found guilty for vehicular manslaughter by hitting and killing a 24 year old college student, while he was walking one evening. The driver faced 20 years in prison following hat accident. Texting while driving is never ok and never will be ok considering the fact that many people are falling victim to this horrible problem.

Drivers that does not get into car accidents normally follow the laws of the road.

January 1st 2018, the state of Georgia established a new law called ""handress free"", hands free is pretty much self explanetory, this law basically means that if you are opperating a motor vehicle of any kind you are not allowed to use any electric devices of any kind. With this law being passed more and more lives are being saved and more and more people are being much safer than they were while they were being blinded by their phone screens and committing crimes while doing so. At this rate people might not be able to have their phones in the driver seat at all.

In conclusion, phones are avery big distraction while on the roads. With a big increase in the death rates and as well as an increase in the laws being passed connected to texting while driving is enough to confirm that phones on the road is (A) a distraction and (B) a huge safety hazard.

Distracted driving has become a dangerous practice on our streets and highways. All do to texting and driving. Texting and driving is similar to driving while intoxicated. You may think you can do it but its not safe. The reason people continue to text and drive are numerous, but it all boils down to one thing. People who text and drive believe they are good enough to get away with it until an accident occurs.

Simply because someone feels like they must respond to a text immediately is why many of the accident occurs and most of the time this leads to a horrible accident that can result to death. In just 2012 alone 3,328 people were killed due to texting and driving so what do you think now? Image if it one of your family members or close friends.

Consider your passage and the people on the road. Why risk your life and others to send a text message? Could you live with yourself knowing you killed others when you know you could have waited or pulled over no text message is that important to put others and your own life in danger. So just put other into thought before grabbing the phone and texting while not paying attention to the road and your surroundings.

However, using a cell phone, whether talking or texting, while driving can be extremely dangerous; it should be made illegal because it is very hazardous to yourself and the people surrounding you, can lead to the death of loved ones, and it is even compared to the danger level of drunk driving.

So in conclusion you should not text and drive because that could be your last time sending a text message to others. If you need to reply to a text message just pull over. A text message is not worth risking your life.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
33824B719879,"In today's society I think phones should be prohibited while operating a vehicle. Every year there are about 6 million car accidents dealing with teenagers between the ages 16 to 19 years old. We as people don't understand that when using a phone while driving they are taking their eyes off the road, people are more worried about their conversation which makes their concentration severely impacted, and it causes more accidents. In order to fix this problem, we as a unit need to break the habit of using phones while driving.

Due to people being on their phones its putting other people's lives at danger. When you're driving in your cellular device start going off that become a distraction. People are more urge to text back. In spite of the fact that picking up or taking a glance can increase you getting into an accident. Entitled to this problem people should put phones on Do Not Disturb or driving mode.

Their reaction time is slower. Resulting in the fact that they are on their phones. For an example, when you are on the highway in a song comes on that you don't like you take your eyes off the road to change it. This means the reaction time is affected by not being focused. Instead of changing it while driving wait until you come to a complete stop then change it.

So many car accidents happened in this day of age that people are being taken away from families. Many people lose loved ones or close friends, because of careless drivers. Most teens don't think about the causes that can affect others. Not to mention adults and teens don't think about their actions when putting other people live at matter. As a result, in making bad actions we as a whole need to think before driving recklessly.

Here are the given reasons to why phones should be prohibited while operating a vehicle. There are too many people losing their lives, reaction time is not as fast, and most of the accidents caused by ages between 16 to 19 years old.

Cell phones are becoming more and more included in our daily lives. From communication, to making and watching videos. They are very essential to us and our day to day schedule. But shouldn't let them ruin our lives either. As they say ""There is a time and place for everything"" (Gloria Tesch), and driving is not the time and place.

According to sources, in 2011 out of 1.3 million car crashes, at least 23% of those crashes involve cell phones. A lot of these drivers reported that they were texting and driving during the time of the accident. The rest reported to have been talking on the phone. Majority of the vehicles that were involved were light trucks and motorcycles. More than 3/4 of drivers said they would likely answer calls while driving and rarely consider traffic situations when deciding to use a cell phone. Most drivers said they would answer a call or text while driving but would feel unsafe as a passenger if the driver was texting.

People try to say that teens or novice drivers are the reason for all these accidents. But according to the data ages 30-39 year olds are the main source of the deaths and drivers ages 15 - 19 had the highest percentage of distracted drivers - 16% of those involved in accidents were distracted. The percentage of fatalities linked to distracted drivers increased from 10% in 2005 to 16% in 2009.

Majority of the states have made laws to try to ensure the safety of americans. No state bans all cellphone use for all drivers, but 39 states and D.C. ban all cell phone use by novice drivers, and 20 states and D.C. prohibit it for school bus drivers.

Washington was the first state to pass a texting ban in 2007. Currently, 48 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands ban text messaging for all drivers. All but three have primary enforcement. Of the two states without an all-driver texting ban, one prohibits text messaging by novice drivers.

In conclusion, texting and driving is not safe at all. It takes away people that are not deserving of the pain that they're receiving. Laws and regulations have been set to try and help lower the deaths caused by using cell phones and driving. Life would go much smoother if people just listened and played their part.

I understand that there are some things that need attention, but it's not worth the lives of innocent people. Nearly about 400,000 people die from texting and driving. 1 out of 4 car accidents occur from texting and driving and that's truly a shame. The average text sent takes the drivers eyes off the road for about 5 seconds and that's enough time to get into a life threatening accident according to SafeWise. com. These deaths hurt people mentally and physically and usually cause depression due to the fact that they lost a loved one to a foolish person. Some people don't even pay attention to the rules put in to place by the law and are seen constantly on the phone with someone.

These people deserve to get their license suspended and maybe even revoked because these people have no empathy for people who actually want to make it to their destination safely. The phone calls and text messages can wait because they aren't worth someone's life and it sure isn't worth going to jail for. Just wait until you reach you reach your destination to do these things.

Phones and driving do not even go together no matter how the argument about it is put. There are a lot of reasons you should not be driving while you are on your phone. It's all about your safety and others as well. Cell phones have been popular ever since they came out with touch screens to be honest. I think you should not use cell phones while you are driving because you may be the cause of an accident or more likely you'll be in one yourself.

One reason you should not use a cell phone while driving is because now a days you could get in trouble by the police. You are not suppose to be on the phone while driving anyway. You have to pay attention to where you are going. People die and come into this world about every second. If you continue to use your phone while you are driving then you'll get taken by one of those seconds.

Another reason you should not use your cell phone while driving is because what if you have people or kids in the car with you? You always have to think about safety first. Driving without a seatbelt is not safe either, it's also just like driving with your phone in your hand. Nothing is hard about putting your phone up while you drive at all.

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons. Several researchers have proved that using cell phones during driving makes driver more exposed to fatal accidents. Focus of the driver is not on the road or traffic and it becomes difficult to handle phone and vehicle at one time. Cell phones during driving also reduce the mental capacity of drivers as they fail to concentrate on minor or major activities happening around them. As already discussed, cell phones distract drivers' attention resulting in comparatively slow response to traffic signals and other related traffic events. Studies have shown the fact that breaking reaction time is also slower while talking on a cell phone during driving. The perception, vision, general awareness, and concentration of the driver are impacted while communicating on a cell phone during driving. Especially during bad weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation pay less attention to these areas increasing risks of fatal accidents. Although, there are grave negative impacts of using cell phones during driving it is pertinent, for the sake of arguments, to present benefits also. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is again the security factor.

During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route. Furthermore, using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Some helpful ways to use phones while driving is when you're in a new area and need to use the phone for GPS as you drive to get to a specific place. Another useful way to use phones while driving is to report roadside accidents in case of emergencies. Having a phone and driving can also provide you on traffic jams, bad weather, and accidents further down the road. Phones can also be useful when you're driving and get lost and a family member can use your phone's location to pinpoint your exact location.

Some ways that are not helpful to phones and driving is when the phone becomes a bad distraction while driving. Not using a phone properly while driving increases the risk of deadly accidents.

Georgia has a hands-free law, meaning you can not hold a phone while driving. This law is to help save lives and bring awareness of using phones while driving.

I hope this paper has given you a better understanding of how useful phones can be while driving, and if not used correctly they can be very harmful. It is very important to educate others on the importance of using phones correctly while driving.

Many drivers today are known for using their phones for locations, for example Lyft and Uber drivers need to use their phones In order to locate where the passengers are going and to also find them, but using your phone to make phone calls, texting, or using social media sites while in traffic Is very dangerous and unsafe for other individuals on the road. According to Pew Report about 59% of young adults are more likely to text and drive and more than a quarter of U.S. adults which Is 27% admit to texting while driving behind the wheel. These are dangers numbers which leads up to some of the reason why accidents happen.

According to Chicago Tribune there are more than 67,000 active Uber and Lyft drivers In the U.S

and all are know to use their phones to find the client or the destination In which the client Is going. This In my opinion Is a great use to use a phone while driving, not to be bias but their are other ways to phone that maybe more dangerous to others safe than that, like using your phone to be on social media, not only do you not have your phone In your hand but your not endangering the passengers (friends or family members) lives but If you have your phone In a phone holder, It ensure the safety of the passenger and also the safety of the other drivers, motorcyclist and pedestrians on the road.

Teens like myself are very active on social media because of the time and age that we live In, It's one in many ways to communicate with people. As I stated In the thesis statement about 59% of teenagers actively use their phones while driving. It Is dangerous for them because not only are some of them new to driving, but If It's their parent's car and they get Into an accident, insurance may not be able to pay for It.

In addition to this that other percentage Is adults which Is 27 percent that use their phones while driving even though they are older and are suppose to know better they still use their phones on the road endangering other pedestrians. These percentages are dangerous and are Increasing over the years which shows in the amount of accidents (According to the National Safety Council, cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes annually).

In conclusion driving while using your phone is bad and it is not beneficial to anyone else on the road. The safety of all drivers and pedestrians depends on what we do and when we do it. Even though i think its ok to use your phone if your are an uber driver or lyft driver i strongly disagree with the use of cellphones while it's in your hands.

According to Edgar Snyder's website one out of four in the United States die or are critically injured from a car crash caused by a cell phone, this proves that cell phones while in the presence of driving should not be allowed.

There are many distractions that happen while driving and on your cellphone for instance; sending a quick message it doesn't take long right? According to a Virginia department of transportation website, it takes 3 seconds to have a car crash and fatally injure you or someone else, or even result in death. Although eating and driving is dangerous, studies from the Decide to Drive website showed that it's a lot safer to eat while driving then trying to operate your cellphone. Another distraction is talking on the phone with people. Some people can't multitask and risk their life to call/text someone. Trying to use social media such as snapchat while driving is extremely dangerous and a distraction we should try to avoid.

Snyder's website also says about 660,000 drivers are trying to use their phones behind the wheel which results in 1.6 million car crashes in a year. When in a wreck caused by a cellphone your risk losing your licenses, killing someone, injuring yourself, or even killing yourself. This shows how dangerous it is to use your cellphone while driving.

In conclusion, I recommend not operating your cellphone behind the wheel. It will make the road safer, and result in a decrease of deaths and injuries. Don't risk your life to send just a quick message or make a quick phone call, drivers should focus on the road and nothing more. Let's be safer and put the phones down.

While driving you're main point of focus should be on the road. A great number of people own a cell phone and the sudden urge to use it while operating a vehicle can be very tempting. There are many reasons, opinion, and facts based on why i think people should and shouldn't use cell phones while on the road. There are pros and cons depending on the situation. Here's why i think people should not use a cellphone while driving.

Using your phone is already a distraction and driving just makes it more worse than it is. While driving you have a lot responsibilities and using a phone just makes it harder to focus. Using a phone while driving is also probably illegal. In certain cases it is highly likely that you will receive a ticket. You can easily save yourself a ticket by just waiting till you are out of the vehicle reply to a text or call. Another reason is the passengers if anyone else is in the car. It is your responsibility to keep everyone in the vehicle safe. Using a phone while driving can increase the chance of a crash by a lot putting your life and the life of the passengers at risk. You can also put pedestrians at risk if you are not paying attention. There are also some reasons why i think it can be okay sometimes for people to use cellphones while driving.

A main reason can be a emergency. Sometimes things happen at unfortunate times while you are driving, but that still is no excuse for you to use a phone while driving. Maybe waiting at the light to reply can sometimes be okay as long as you are paying attention. If you need to call or answer a call you can maybe put the phone on a mount so that your hands are still on the wheel and you still have your focus on the road. I personally know people who do this and in my opinion it's the safest way to answer the phone hands free while all your attention is still on the road. If you get a text or a call and you really can't help yourself, find somewhere to park. It doesn't take that long and it can save your life, the life of others, and reduce the chance of getting into a crash.

There's a lot of facts that show why texting and driving can be so fatal. 94% of teen drivers acknowledge the fact that texting and driving is extremely dangerous, but 35% still admit to doing it, while 21% get into fatal crashes due to texting and driving. The percentage to get in a crash while texting and driving increased by 23%.

Answering a text takes your attention away for about 5 seconds and while going at 55 mph, that's enough to the length of a football field without even looking at the road. There are an endless amount of facts and statistics about this, and reading some to obtain the knowledge about this danger is great for your safety and the safety of others.

In conclusion, i don't think anyone should text and drive in under any circumstances because you are increasing the chance of a crash and risking lives. There is no excuse to why you should even pick up a phone while driving. If you absolutely have to because of an emergency or other reasons then you can park and take care of it from there. It's much safer and you can be saving lives                                                      ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

They're car accidents everyday do to the several of reason. Cellular devices while driving is one of the biggest ways people today get in car accidents. In some states there's laws out saying you can't be on your phone while driving. I do believe that the law should be in place everywhere in the United states Because I witnessed myself people almost crashing because on their phones. Being on your phone while driving can create you to crash or to run a red light or stop sign because of not paying attention.

While on your phone and driving can create a car accident because you're not focused on the road. Car accident can cause server injuries and sometimes death, so if you want to prevent these accidents from happening you should try to focus on the road and stay off your phone while driving.

I think if you're going to be on your phone you need to be at a stopping point like at a red light or parked somewhere. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. So if people stop phone usage while in an operating vehicle the death and injury rate would go down tremendously.

Once when I was 12 years old I experience my first car accident.

I was in the car with my cousin and we were headed to my grandmother's house for a cook out. We were all joking around in the car while playing loud music. I forgot to mention that my youngest siblings were also in the car with me. My big cousin started texting her friends while she was driving not paying attention to the road that much only looking up every once in a while and like 5 minutes later she was approaching a red light not noticing she didn't slow the car down. Next thing you know we bump into the car in front of us and creating an accident. That's the reason why I don't agree with allowing to have a phone while being in a car driving especially with other people in the car that could cause an injury and possibly death.

When you have a phone in a car with you you're able to call of an emergency. If there's someone in the car with you you can tell them what you want them to say on the text message or in a call so you don't have to get distracted while driving. Some cars are actually able to hook their phone up to their car so they can answer the phone while driving and still be cautious on the road. Most people believe since they been driving and texting for so long that the possibilities of them getting in a car accidents low.

Being on your phone while driving is dangerous and it should be restricted in all states. It causes numerous of car accidents which comes with numerous of death and injuries. It safer to have your phone programed in your car so you won't be distracted. If you have to text someone then try getting to a stopping point so you'll not take any risk of getting in a car accident.   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Our society's reliance on technology has increased significantly in the past few decades.

Mobile phones were once brick-like impractical devices. Since then, they have evolved into sleek mini computers. Now that phones are more portable, people tend to take their cell with them everywhere, including on the road. With the heavy reliance our society has created around these devices, it is, understandably, difficult to resist using them. For this very reason, cell phones pose a great risk to driver's. The distraction imposed by smartphones can be just as harmful as driving under the influence. Using cell phones at all while driving should absolutely not be allowed. Any amount of attention diverted from the road is incredibly dangerous.

Some of the most fatal accidents have occured, not because of intoxication, but as a result of texting and driving. In 2018, 4,637 people died in car crashes due to cell phone use (The Zebra). That is 4,637 lives that could have been spared if it weren't for the recklessness of irresponsible drivers. In 2002, 62% of people owned regular cell phones, while today, in 2019, about 95% of americans own cell phones. 77% of these modern cell phones owners have smartphones, which can be even more distracting (Pew Research Center). In that time, car accidents caused by cell phone distraction has increased from 6% to 25% of all car accidents (Schlossberg 2002, Miller & Zois 2019). There is a clear correlation between the increased reliance of cell phones and distracted driving accidents. The irresponsible actions of these drivers is causing increased danger on our roads. Leniency cannot be accepted. The law should have absolutely no tolerance for this hazardous driving.

Even the best drivers may be involved in a potentially life-threatening crash while trying to use their phone and drive. According to an NPR article on multitasking, when you are ""Switching from task to task, you think you're actually paying attention to everything around you at the same time. But you're actually not. You're not paying attention to one or two things simultaneously, but switching between them very rapidly"" (Hamilton). The article later goes on to state, ""You cannot focus on one while doing the other. That's because of what's called interference between the two tasks."" Based off of this information, it can be inferred the concept of interference is also applicable to using a smartphone while driving. If a driver is busy paying attention to their screen, there is no way they could also be paying close attention to the road.

Even five seconds of being distracted by a cell phone can be enough time for someone to get into an accident. One personal injury lawyer states, ""A single text results in an average distraction of 5 seconds, during which time a car going 55 mph will travel the length of a football field"" (Miller & Zois). A range this large in a such a short time span conveys how much potential there is for injury when behaving so carelessly. Anyone who may claim it is safe for them to go on their phone while operating a vehicle because they are a master at multitasking is simply overconfident in their abilities. The truth is, it would be impossible for anyone to drive safely while distracted.

With lives at risk, texting and driving should be out of the question. Not only would such negligence put one's own physical well being at risk, but all those around them as well.

Thousands of deaths could be prevented each year if everyone were to simply put their phone down while driving. No notification, song, or post is worth compromising the safety of the general public. Ensuring others' security should be a priority for all americans. When one fourth of car accidents involve cell phones, there is a serious problem. Complete focus and concentration on the road while driving should just be common sense. Keep the phone down.

The National Safety Council says that using a cell phone while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. People are often hit or run over by a car only because the drive was looking at their phone.

Within our society we approach many problems though, one of the major problems is using a phone while driving. There are many reasons why this is a major problem but were only going to cover three. One reason why is because of the car wreck that occurs during this action. Another reason is because it is very illegal for people to proceed with action and they also create a bad influence on the kids that rides with them. Clearly, in my opinion i feel that people shouldn't use their phones and drive, now i'm going to go in depth as to why I feel this way.

The National Safety Council also known as the NSC shows that texting and driving leads to 1.6 million car wrecks per year. Even though people don't usually text and drive on purpose, when they do they sometimes become unlucky. Also in the united states every one out of four car accidents happen because of texting and driving. Therefore most of the united states car accidents happen because of this. This means the more people doing this the more wrecks it's going to be.

Second, while living in the united states it is very illegal to use your phone while your hands are busy. The distracted driving law states that georgia drivers have to have hands free or voice activated devices in order to talk on the phone. This means that you have to have a way to connect your phone to the car so you won't have to touch your phone. Even if you don't have a device you can connect to the car you still need some thing you can talk into in order to answer or call someone. If everyone would use these two devices there wouldn't be as many car accidents.

Finally, the last reason why people shouldn't use phones while driving is because it brings a bad influence on the children that rides with them. Stats show that kids tend to self-teach themselves things that aren't taught to them second hand. This is also dangerous because the more negative influence people put on their children the more bad they will turn out. They will also begin to adapt to bad habits and end up in places they will not want to be.

In conclusion, many people know what will be the effects of this cause but still does it. This is very dangerous for not just you but the people that suffer from your accident. Even though the majority of people in our society still does this dangerous action, this is one thing that people should take into consideration .   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Distracted driving costs approximately $129 billion per year, but despite all of this, there are still some states that feel it is unnecessary to ban texting and driving. It is absolutely necessary to ban texting and driving to prevent the deaths and waste of resources it causes.

Texting and driving is dangerous. A vehicle travelling at 60mph will move 88 feet in just one second. This means that if the driver looks away from the road for even a single second, they will have moved 88 feet by the time they look back. When moving at high speeds in a vehicle, a lot can happen in a single second. The vehicle could drift off the road, hit another vehicle, or even hit a pedestrian. When a driver sends or receives a text, they're not looking away from the road for just one second, or even two seconds. They're looking away from the road for five seconds.

Five seconds at 60mph is 440 feet. That's 440 feet the driver has moved without even looking at the road. This is something that happens every time someone looks at their phone to send or receive a text. This is unsafe and should be banned.

Texting and driving, though it is banned in most states, is not uncommon. Three quarters of drivers who own a cell phone have admitted to texting and driving, despite the overwhelming majority of them knowing about the dangers. At any given time 7% of drivers are using their phones while driving. The knowledge that texting and driving is dangerous is not enough to deter most people. Simply informing people that texting and driving is dangerous is not enough to prevent them from doing it; texting and driving must be banned everywhere in the country.

Texting and driving significantly increases the risk of a car accident, and accounts for a significant amount of actual accidents. Fourteen percent of all car accidents are associated with texting and driving, and it is the leading cause of car accidents, even more common than drunk driving. When a driver is texting while driving the amount of time their eyes are off the road increases significantly, by about 400%. Avoiding texting and driving could reduce the amount of time the driver has with their eyes off the road to a quarter and reduce the chances of an accident.

Texting and driving causes 3000 deaths per year in the United States alone, and costs $129 billion per year. Every year many of the people that die as a result of texting and driving are drivers other than those who are texting. Often it's passengers, pedestrians, and even other drivers who are killed by distracted driving, but most deaths are the drivers themselves. The resources that have been lost because of distracted driving could have gone to something that could help people. But instead it is wasted because distracted driving has caused car accidents that cost a significant amount of money. Distracted driving causes many deaths and wastes a lot of resources that could be used to help people.

Distracted driving is a major issue, but unfortunately, there are still some people who feel it should not be banned. It is still legal in three states and there are no national laws making it illegal. Despite 3000 deaths per year, $129 billion wasted, and it being the leading cause of accidents it is still not banned in some places. Texting while driving should be banned.

Driving while texting or calling someone can result in a terrible car accident because the phone distracts the driver from the road causing them to not pay attention to their surroundings. This is the reason we now have hand free hand free technology to decrease the amount of distracted drivers.

When a driver is on their phone at a red light this can cause them to not pay attention to the stop light which means the other drivers are most likely to get mad and result into nasty behavior such as blowing the horn or simply putting their selves in jeopardy by going around the other person.

Today, the majority of the population operate a cell phone on the daily basis. What's your opinion on whether or not a driver should or should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Well my opinion is that I think drivers should not be able to u cell phones while driving.

My first reason on why I think that drivers shouldn't be able to use a cell phone while operating a vehicle is because it could cause a major distraction. Having a distraction while driving can cause any bad things to happen. Cell phone distractions have led to car crashes which has led to death and serious injuries. There are hand-held cellphone use ban in about 20 states. All cell phone ban in 21 states and text messaging ban in 48 states. Each year over 330,000 accidents have been caused by cell phones.

Using a cellphone while driving puts life's at risk. Not only does it put your life at risk but also the people surrounding you. You and the passengers in the vehicle could get injured or could even die. Also the drivers and passengers around you. "" While using a phone is the most common form, distracted driving is anything that diverts a driver's attention from the road, even something as simple as changing the radio station."" Is an opinion from www. thecrcconnction. com . Some people go out and think they will come back fine but sometimes things can happen on the road.

Using phones while driving will always be a huge distraction even if some people deny it. Deaths and injuries have happened to kids, teenagers, adults, etc. This is why phones shouldn't be used while driving to prevent these types of things from happening. Even though there are laws that have been made to prevent these things people still ignore them.           ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Why you should be able to use your phone while driving. There are many reasons to use one's phone while driving such as music, calls, and texting of course. If someone is driving through their neighborhood and they notice something suspicious at their neighbor's house on the way home they're going to report it to the police, immediately. But how are they going to do that while driving? By using their phone to contact the authorities. Say a family member was hurt in an accident and you were on your way home. You would be able to find out that they were hurt thanks to your cellphone. You can also use your phone for roadside assistance if your car breaks down.

What if the radio in your car happens to go out? You've got your phone to play all the music you may or may not have illegally downloaded. This then gets you through your long drive from point A all the way to point D. what if you can't call someone while you're in the car well then just text them. You're running late to work so you text your boss that you're caught in traffic. Say your wife has gone into labor and you're in an important meeting and her sister text you, she's taking her to the hospital to give birth. How did she inform you she was going into labor texting while driving. These are all valid reasons as to why you should be allowed to use your phone while driving.

Dear, reader today majority of people have cell phones and here is reasons why they should not be able to operate phones while driving. In my personal experience of being in the car while the driver is on the phone. Was we got in a very bad wreck the car rolled three times, I was sitting in the back seat with my little niece and that morning my sister had got broken up with. So all this day of the wreck she was mourning, and after all day of being at my mom's house we were packing up and leaving just pulled out the driveway and over the train tracks. It was just getting dark outside I would have to say it was 6:30 and my sister pulled out her phone and all I here was her crying and I looked up and we where going around a sharp turn. Then everything was going in slow motion Like I can not even explain how none of us got hurt. The police showed up about 15 minutes later and they started asking everyone if they were ok, then the police walked up to sister and asked ""if she was on her phone"" and my sister said ""yes"" so they wrote her a ticket and it was a BIG ONE. So do not text and drive it will cost you!   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

This is my essay on why people shouldn't drive and talk on the cellular device at the same time. People shouldn't drive and text or talk on the cellular device why I feel this way, well I feel this way because a lot of things can go wrong when driving and being on the cellular device. When driving you shouldn't be on your phone you should be focusing on the road because once you take your eyes off the road so many things can go wrong. You can cause an accident you can kill somebody all because you weren't paying attention. I think it should be against the law to drive and text while can end so many lives. I say if you must answer a call or a text you should pull over and answer is no need to answer it while you're on the road just to stay safe. To prevent accidents, you just shouldn't be on your phones you should pull over to the side and answer it.    ",2,Phones and driving,Independent,0.2
D78130714BEF,"Cell phones have some way of taking our full individual attention for however long we allow it to. We become easily distracted and connected to our phones. People usually look at it just to look at it, without any notifications popping up, solely based on us humans being attracted to our phone. There also is that part of us using our cell phones to stay in the mix, see what's hot on Instagram, or if that hot guy or girl posted on Snapchat. There are many times and places you could multitask with your phone. However, driving a vehicle is not something you should try to multitask with because slip-ups while driving are very unforgiving. One minor mistake on the road can cause your life or someone else's life to be taken. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving.

Fatality is an occurrence of death by accident. Sure you do not mean harm when you are texting your friend while you are driving, but once that sudden stop or movement you did not see causes you to crash, you could possibly die or kill someone else. No one behind the wheel of a vehicle expects it to be their last time driving. However, approximately 660,000 people are attempting to use their phones while driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics). According to The National Safety Council, cell phone use leads to 1.6 million crashes each year (""On the Road).

Nearly 390,000 injuries were caused by accidents attributed to texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics""). In 2016, 3,450 fatalities were caused by texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics""). Also one out every four car crashes in the United States are caused by texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Statistics). In conclusion, texting and driving is dangerous to lives of others.

Texting and driving is just as dangerous as driving under the influence. Some people would agree that driving while drunk is the most common and dangerous thing you could do. However, The National Safety Council states that someone texting while driving is six times more likely to cause an accident than someone driving drunk (""On the Road""). Therefore, it is more common for people to be distracted by their phones to cause an accident than driving under the influence is.

Reaction times decrease by 35% when texting and driving, compared to the 12% decrease when driving under the influence of alcohol (""Texting While Driving is More Dangerous than Drinking and Driving""). Steering control while distracted is 91% poorer than those who are driving with full concentration (""Texting While Driving is More Dangerous than Drinking and Driving"").

In 2002, there were 12,405 drunk driving fatalities (Masters); then that number decreased to 9,296 in 2011 (Masters). However, distracted driving resulted in approximately 2,600 deaths in 2002 (""Texting while driving Vs. Drunk Driving: Which Is More Dangerous). The number of distracted driving accidents increased by 22% in 2011 and resulted in 3,331 fatalities (Masters, ""Texting While Driving Vs. Drunk Driving: Which Is More Dangerous?). Drive to drive; texting and driving is just as bad as driving drunk.

Texting and driving is now illegal in multiple states, which means you are committing a crime when you text and drive. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, 47 states plus Washington D.C. ban texting for all drivers (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). Four states allow officers to pull someone over for texting, without any other reason (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). In California, the consequence is $20 for the first offense and $50 for each subsequent offense (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). There are other states who take the offense more serious, Alaska you could be charged with a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in prison and a $50,000 fine. Kill someone while texting and driving, and you could be looking at 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). Then a car accident would lead to your car insurance to rise. According to a group of researchers, they found that some kind of texting law leads to a 2.3% decrease in fatalities for all drivers. Specifically banning teen drivers from texting reduced traffic deaths in that group by 11 percent (""Texting & Driving Laws: Is it Illegal in Your State?""). In conclusion, texting and driving could ultimately cause you unnecessary fees, or big time in prison.

In summary, drivers should know that they are dealing with something serious when driving a car. There are limited chances in life;texting and driving are pushing those chances away. Drive with the intent and purpose to get to your destination. Deal with texts after or before you drive, because it could cost you everything. Attention is highly needed when driving, there are split-second decisions to be made while driving and your phone distracts your attention enough to potentially cause accidents. Your reaction time is based on how early you see it, looking at a phone prohibits you from reacting. In conclusion, put your phone away while driving to save lives!

7.68E+11,"Drivers Should Not Be Able to Use Phones While Driving

Approximately 25% of all motor related injuries and fatalities are caused by distracted drivers. Distracted driving includes any activity that requires you to not have your full attention on the road and your surroundings while driving. A big factor in distracted driving is the development of cellphones over the past few decades and the common use of them while driving. Driving while using your cellphone takes your attention and focus off of the road and during the time someone takes their eyes off the road to look at their phone anything could happen. This poses a large threat to themselves, other people that may be riding in the vehicle, and the other people driving on the road. This is why drivers should not be able to use phones while driving.

Distracted Driving been the source of countless motor vehicle related fatalities. According to the Department of Motor Vehicles, at least ""9 people in the U.S. are killed each day as a result of crashes involving a distracted driver."" Using a cellphone while driving coincides with the idea of distracted driving. Many teens and adults feel the need to be on their phones while driving but this poses a large threat to innocent people driving on the road. Distracted driving has been considered by many as an epidemic that is entirely preventable but hasn't yet been prevented. Though many states have passed a law criminalizing distracted driving, it still remains a large problem within the United States in itself.

Texting and driving is among the most fatal types of distracted driving as ""when a driver reads or sends a text message, his or her eyes are off the road for five seconds, meaning that a person driving 55 mph would travel the length of a football field without looking at the road"" (Kitch). During these 5 seconds, there is a high chance of getting into a fatal car or vehicle crash which is a threat to other drivers on the road. People who use their cellphones while driving pose themselves as a risk to anyone in the vehicle with them or anyone driving on the roads around them.

All in all, distracted driving, and specifically cellphone usage while driving, causes a great threat to many people. Further action should be taken in order to prevent more deaths and injuries resulting from it and should be heavily enforced. The threat cellphone usage poses to people should stop people from being able to use their phones while driving.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

According to the National Council, there are 1.6 million crashes reported each year.(Snyder, 2019) The cause? Cell phone use. Each of these drivers were either texting, or using the cell phone in some way. Drivers shouldn't be permitted to use their cell phones in anyway while driving. The result of banning cell phones at the wheel would be a smaller number of deaths and injuries. This would also include hands free devices and phone calls. Anything that causes a distraction from the road included changing the playlist on your phone could cost you your life. However, there is a way that your phone could actually save your life.

On July 1st, 2018, Georgia passed a statewide ""hands free"" law. The law prohibits drivers to touch or even have the phone ""touch any part of their body"" while driving, this includes at stoplights too. The punishment for this, a 50 dollar fine and increases with each offence. The creation of this law came into effect after the ""no texting a driving"" law of 2010. People such as Representative John Carson say, ""It's completely ineffective."" The law is useless if making calls is still allowed.(Hafner, 2018) Since the hands free law was passed, the number of crashes reported because of cell phone use has decreased by two percent. Robert Hydrick, communications director for the Governor's Office of Highway Safety, points out that, ""Banning the cell phone isn't the cure, but it is a step in the right direction."" (Estep, 2018)

Knowing how much of an impact the cell phone has on drivers life, iPhone designer John Casey with the help of other engineers, designed a feature on the iPhone that could actually save your life while behind the wheel. The ""Do Not Disturb While Driving"" feature on the phone can sense when you are driving or in the car. Your phone proceeds to pop up an alert that gives you the option to turn on the do not disturb setting. When on, the feature mutes texts and calls or sometimes normal functions of the phone to cancel any distractions. I know you're probably thinking, what if its an emergency? Apple has that under control. If a message is sent to your phone, an option to send a prewritten message telling the person you are driving comes to the screen. If its an emergency, the sender can send it with ""urgency"" and the message will be bypassed to your screen. Since the creation of this setting, phone usage among drivers has decreased by 8%. (Baig, 2018)

As a result of enforcing the Georgia hands free law and features on the phone such as do not disturb, there will be a significant reduction of cell phone related car accidents in the near future. I strongly believe that in order to accomplish that goal, cell phones must be banned at the wheel. Our justice system must enforce the laws made to prevent more crashes from happening. As well as drivers using features on there phone to help them eliminate distraction. That text can wait.

Today I will be writing about if driving your car to work or school, if u should be able to use your cell phone. Most or all humans have cell phones in the world and use the phones every chance they get. But not all humans drive. You may be asking yourself if driving and texting is safe. Well follow along and i'll give you the inside scoop if it's right or wrong.

Just in the united states 227 million people are licensed drivers. There are about 13.2 million young drives in the united states, between the ages of 15 and 20. For 2018 257.3 million smartphones are being used everyday. Most of the humans who have a smartphone drives a motor vehicle. Average number of car accidents in the U.S. every year is 6 million. More than 90 people die in car accidents everyday. 3 million people in the U.S. are injured every year in car accidents. Around 2 million drivers in car accidents experience permanent injuries every year. Thats alot of car crashes there are just in the us. The NSC has found out that every 1 out of four car accidents are caused by texting and driving. Texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk.

According to the AAA poll 94% of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting or calling on the phone, but 35% admitted to doing it anyway. If you are still asking if using your phone while driving is safe its not. If there is a text or call that is really important than pull over to the closest store or parking lot. Not only will u be hurting or killing yourself you are also damaging other people's lives too. We learned a lot from this research put the phone down while driving.

Phones an everyday distraction in life. They distract us from work and many other things. But none as bad as when you're driving. Many people die because of people looking down at their phones whale their driving. It kills on average of 10% of people 15 and up out of all the deaths from age all the way to being shot. 10% is a large number of people who died from these electronics so I belive there is a way to make it a smaller number.

* Turning off your phone when you get in your car.

* Putting your phone in the back seat so you would have to make a stop get out and open the back door to grab your phone.

* Put your phone on the none setting so it won't vibrate or ring when you're driving.

* Have your passenger use your phone for you.

* Get more police on patrol and get them to watch for people driving and using their phones and if they find one give them a ticket and a court date.

If we follow these simple guidelines and one rule then the cause of death from using a phone and driving will drop. In my eyes I believe that the cause of deaths by this will at least half or maybe even more. This will cause people to feel safer to leave their house. This will also cause more people to go outside for walks meaning less people sitting in their house eating and only gaining to much weight. So, this will make the whole world a better safer place to be.   ",2,Phones and driving,Independent,0.2

Many people would agree that it shouldn't be allowed to use phones while driving, due to the distraction from the road, and gives you less time to react if something happens. Using a phone while driving brings more dangers to one of the most dangerous and daily tasks of a regular person.

Using your phone while driving is a distraction from the road which is really dangerous not just for the driver but those around the car. In many cases of car accidents are caused by distracted driving with phones and this is most common with teens. These car accidents aren't just dangerous for those involved but can also cause death in many incidents.

Another reason why people shouldn't use their phone while driving is because, it would give the driver shorter time to react if something happened such as a pedestrian running into the street because if you hit them it will be the drivers fault and could get into legal trouble or worse yet the driver gets into a car crash and dies.

When you're driving and on your phone at the same time you're risking other people lives and yours too. There should be a new law that says there should not be any electronics placed in a moving vehicle. Plenty of people been killed in an accident because some careless human being decides to drive and text and take their eyes off the road.

Another thing if you're going to have your phone in your car turn it on do not disturb or silent so when you receive a phone call or text you will not be distracted. If you get caught by the police texting while driving there should be a huge fine to make people learn their lessons. Texting while driving is basically like drunk driving either way there's an accident that's about to happen, but it can never lead up to that point if you just put the phone down.

All it takes is just one little glance at your phone then BOOM!! An accident you just created. Just do everyone a favor and put the phone on hold.

Imagine your sitting at a red light on your way to meet up, and all the sudden you see a teen driver in your rear view mirror on their phone not paying attention and bamm they smack right into your rear. This may seem out of the ordinary but it's happening way too often, with so much access to technology people can't stand to resist the temptation of a simple text which can mean fatal consequences. This is why people should not be able to use cell phones in any way.

Cell phone usage has been on a steady incline, with new and better phones out in the market is letting people have more access to these products. While cell phones are helpful in many ways, they can lead to people taking calls at inappropriate times such as when driving, which can lead to avoidable injuries that can be fatal and could have been avoided by just being a responsible driver. Distracted driving accidents account for almost 25 percent of all collinson crashes. In 2015 319,000 injuries were reported that involved distracted driving.

Furthermore phones were involved in most of these accidents if we raise awareness from a younger age and set good examples for the next generation, we will have fewer car wrecks and pointless death will be less common. These are the reasons why phones should not be used while operating a motor vehicle.

The average person is claimed to spend about three hours on a cellular device daily, for others that number is much higher. With cell phones constantly being upgraded and advancing, it makes it more tempting for individuals to buy them and cause people to use them more than what is necessary. This leads to adults and teens to even be tempted to use them even while on the road. Should drivers be able to use a cell phone in any captivity while behind the wheel? Even if it's for something as simple as only using it for GPS directions. It's all up to the way the driver uses that privilege. The usage of a phone while driving should be avoided as much as possible, especially texting and driving. When you think about it, texting and driving is the equivalent to driving intoxicated or under the influence. By taking the chance and texting while driving Your putting you and innocent pedestrians in danger.

Too many people have lost their lives because someone was not being cautious, being on their device and not paying attention to the road, distracted by their phone trying to reply to a simple message that can wait till you are safely parked or not on the road. Why risk getting a ticket and having to pay money or even getting arrested or possible taking a life just by being careless and making a little mistake you could have easily refrained from.

2B9A53A50171,"I'm a teenager myself, phones are very addicted. They are like a key part of our life. People use cellphones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, planning, internet browsing etc. Sometimes we like to do two or more of these things at once. Some people are choosing the wrong times to use their cellular devices. When they are driving.

As a society we have became so focused on how much we can do at one time that we don't realize how it could be effecting our personal safety, and the safety of others around us. When driving its already pretty hard to stay focused on the road. Let alone with a handheld phone as a distraction. The roads are shared for everyone and not just you, don't let your dumb decision affect others life on the road as well.

Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if its causing us to be late to work school or whatever else it may be.

In the article made by Consultancy Buss Maven Labs, Scott Clark says ""A young women killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone."" She may not have intended to end the poor boys life but now she has to live with that. Any of us could have been that poor boy riding his bike. Don't be selfish!

There are many more ways to distract a drivers attention. Talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. Therefore, drivers have to operate the vehicle already. Why let a cellphone distract you trying to operate it at the same time? Cellphones while driving have caused thousands of wrecks across the world, some even leading to death upon the passenger or the people in the other car.

Think before you pick up your phone behind the wheel. Is it worth it? Your life and anybody in the car with you lifes could be gone just so you got to send that text. Focus on what is more important,

Getting to your destination. You can be on your phone another time. Hoped this helped you.            ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Driving is something that most people in the world do. It is important to a person's daily life, because driving is used to go from place to place. Phones are also something that most people have, and deem important. Phones can be used to browse the internet, and to be able to contact someone in an emergency. However using the phone while driving is not only a bad thing, it is dangerous.

Using the phone while driving is usually referred to as Distracted Driving. Distracted driving is dangerous for not only the driver, but also those around the driver. The average amount of time it takes for a person to read a text is around five seconds. If the driver is traveling at 55mph (88.5kmh), which is standard highway speed, in those five seconds the vehicle had covered a distance of 403ft (123 meters). The situation on the road could easily have changed in that distance which could cause an accident. According to the CDC, out of the 2,443,000 vehicle injuries that occurred in 2015, 391,000 of the injuries are due to Distracted Driving. Then out of the 35,092 vehicle deaths that occurred in 2015, 3,447 of the deaths are due to Distracted Driving (Distracted Driving | Motor Vehicle Safety | CDC Injury Center). Although these may not seem very large in terms of percentage these numbers are still quite big.

Despite both driving and phones being very important parts of a person's life using a phone while driving is a very dangerous thing. Due to how dangerous it is to use a phone while driving people should not be looking at their phone at all while driving, but hands off things such as Bluetooth connection that were set up before the vehicle is in motion should be allowed since a person is not taking their eyes off the road. Distracted Driving is an incredibly dangerous thing to do, and that is why using the phone while driving should not be allowed.

BBF9F4C1E46A,"It's a nice, peaceful day outside. The wind slowly blows through the trees, and the sun shines brightly. You're driving with your window down, and you can smell food in the air. Your destination is your mom's house to eat dinner with the family. Suddenly, your phone pings in the passenger seat. You reach over to tap it, so you can see what the notification was. Before you even get over there, a large horn sounds through the air along with the sound of your car smashing into another. You've just crashed your car into another, injuring yourself and the people in the other car. It was all because of that notification catching your attention. Clearly, phones should not be allowed out in cars.

Phones should always be on silent in the car. Our brains are trained to jump at the sound of our phone beeping. Our genes have been shaped through generations to seek rewards, and the little notification sound triggers our brain's carnal function to check for a reward. You literally cannot for a long time after a phone beeps without touching it unless you have a really strong sense of willpower. If our brains are trained to check our phone as soon as it beeps, why should we risk our brains immediately going for the phone in the car when we can just turn it off?

Phones should also not be visible, because we are inclined to touch it when we see it, especially if the screen lights up. It only takes one moment of somebody's eyes leaving the road for there to be a life-altering crash. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. This means that 1.6 million times a year, a phone caused somebody to crash their car. That one moment they needed to look at the road and they didn't, happened 1.6 million times in one year. Without a doubt, if phones weren't out in those cars, those 1.6 million incidents would be non-existent.

Last but not least, phones should be put out of the driver's reach at all times including red lights. Undoubtedly, with technology today, there should be no excuse for someone to be on the phone while driving. You can click your steering wheel for whatever you need in most newer model cars. Taking your eyes off the road endangers both you and other people on the road.

One of the studies of Harvard concluded that 2 in every 3 people are addicted to their phones. Sometimes we have to take precautions, simply because we just cannot control ourselves sometimes. A good percentage of people whip out their phones at a red light without even thinking because they think they're safe. Even at a red light, there are still cars moving around you, consequently, you must always be alert on the road.

Phones should not be allowed to be seen, hear, or be in reach when in a vehicle. It puts human lives at stake, and it ruins others. Having a phone in the car is one of the most dangerous things you can do in a vehicle. Next time, you stop at a red light and see somebody on their phone ask yourself this. Is whatever they're doing worth it?   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Everywhere you go what do you see, you see your everyday family walking around with smartphones, or a businessman on a call for a meeting with a phone, but why do people do that while driving. All across the nation people everyday are using their cell phones while driving and causing more traffic collisions in the past decade or so then compared to drunk driving accidents. People should not be using a cell phone while driving because its a major distraction for the driver and can cause someone to get hurt or even killed. If today, you walked into a normal public high school and go into a class, you would see a lot of students sitting bored and playing on sometime of phone or device. Now imagine that person doing the same thing when driving, hard to imagine but a lot of the accidents that occur when people or using a cell phone is caused by teenagers and young adults.

Many states such as Georgia in the U.S. have implemented a law which requires its people to drive hands free which means if you are caught driving with a phone in hand, you will be punished with a hefty fine or jail time. A study was set in place to determine the rate of increase on cell phone related crashes each year and the number is a shocking 1.6 Million crashes and of that, 390,000 are either injured or killed. Cell phone related crashes are the number one causes of death inside the U.S's borders for the past 10 years and needs to be solved fast. The best way to regulate and control this dilemma is by implementing a law similar to Georgia's hands free law to every state to ensure that no one will drive and use a cell phone.

The only instance to which a person should be using a cell phone while driving should be by law enforcement or if you are a passenger in the vehicle. The driver needs to focus on the road at all times to ensure that his/her passengers or even just him/herself arrives to their destination on time. Even when a driver is not using a cell phone, they are still distracted by a passenger even when they are trying to show the driver something on another phone and cause an accident. The driver has only one job and is to keep all souls in a vehicle safe and secure at all times and should not be distracted.    ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Over the years, phones and other technology have taken over the lives of society. They have become a major necessity to society. People go everywhere with them and it often feels as though you've lost a child of you don't have it with you.

Although phones are of great use to every human being there are also a major drawback. People do not know how to discipline themselves to put away their phones, especially while they're driving in a vehicle.

Drivers should not be able to use their cellphones while driving.

On any given day, about 660,000 americans will attempt to use their phones while in a vehicle according to FFC.

According to CDC, texting and driving caused a whopping nine deaths and over 500 injuries in the year of 2018. One out of four car crashes are caused by texting and driving. Many studies have shown that texting while driving doubles the chance of getting into an accident. The obsession of phones have caused way too many casualties than needed.

Many laws have been established to prevent the rise of deaths caused by texting and driving. About sixteen states including the U.S. ban all hand-held cell phone use , while others have placed restrictions regarding cell phones. Some states like, Connecticut,

Georgia , New Jersey, and Maryland have placed penalties or fines for people that are texting while driving. These laws and penalties have shown to be pretty effective, the rates of casualties due to cell phone use have gone down tremendously.

People in this society should also research ways to help them prevent the usage of the phones while driving. People all over the world should take their lives more seriously.

Answering a text, taking a video for snapchat, whatever the case may be should not be the cause of their fatal death.

Sadly, people are choosing to be on their phones while they are driving. Not only is this decision incredibly dull, for you could injure yourself but others as well, but there are many reasons why using a cell phone while driving is dangerous,

One of the biggest reasons why using your cellphone while driving is dangerous is that texting and driving not only puts you in danger but will put all the drivers sharing the road with you at risk, too, because you are unable to navigate the road while looking down at the phone in your lap. Did you know ""that an estimated 1.5 million car accidents in the U.S. in 2018 according to the National Safety Council? The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year""(Center and Statistics, 2020) in Georgia alone.

Using your phone while driving is a worse combination than a chicken sandwich and mayonnaise. Most people with common sense know this. You may pull it off a few times, but one day, you will look away at the wrong time. There are many reasons why you shouldn't use your phone while driving. The first one is pretty obvious.

One reason you shouldn't text and drive is because you won't be focused on the road as much. You're at more risk of getting into a car wreck. The brain is focused on the next message you're about to send, rather than the road. Driving requires as much focus as possible. Even something as small as checking the time can put your life at risk.

Another reason is that you could possibly kill someone with your vehicle due to not being focused on where you are going. You could swerve in a different lane unintentionally and hit another driver, causing them to possibly spin out of control, or drive into a wall or tree. The best thing to do is to turn your phone off while operating a car just so you can focus on your next destination. It doesn't matter how much experience you have. Accidents happen when you least expect it.

Finally, the last reason you shouldn't driving and text is because you could unintentionally get lost because you made the wrong turn, or you missed your exit. It is so easy to miss your turn even without a phone in your hand, so imagine actually being on it. Some people have short attention spans; they can't multitask like others. Unless you're using your gps, you shouldn't even be looking at the screen.

Many deaths have occured because of the driver's false confidence of being able to text and drive. There's no way to finesse your way around it. Statistics show that you're more safer in an airplane than in an actual automobile. Driving is already risky as it is. By you using your phone, you instantly put your life in even more risk, and also others. So many more people would be alive today if they would just turn their phones off before turning on their car.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6
E856D94C6B6B,"Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

As technology becomes more ordinary, people are finding phones more needed than ever. However there are drawbacks. With phones being so prominent in today's world texting and driving has become a dangerous habit a lot of people participate in. Because of this a question has occurred, should drivers be able to be on the phone and drive?

Thesis

Drivers should be able to be on the phone and drive because talking and driving is done all the time and cell phones are too important to be completely inaccessible in the car.

One of the reasons why drivers should be able to access their phone is due to phones being the main way of communication in the modern world. To completely cut off that communication when driving could be detrimental for people who need to be prepared to respond to people ASAP. There's also GPSs on phones that people use for navigation that would now be banned due to making phones illegal to use during driving.

The other reason to keep phones legal while driving is the actual lack of danger while driving and using a phone. While texting and driving is dangerous. Just calling and driving should not be an offense. As people talk and drive with each other all the time. And being on the cell phone is essentially the same thing.

Conclusion

So in conclusion people should be able to use their phone while driving. As it is not any more dangerous than talking and driving as well as it being a necessity for fast communication.                              ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
028C510861B9,"In recent years, many states have passed laws in which drivers are not allowed to use their cell phones while driving. Georgia, in particular, passed the Hands Free Law in 2018; this helped establish that phones cannot be used while driving, only when the car is parked. Since the release of this law, accidents due to phones have greatly diminished. Although in today's society cell phone have become a critical part of everyone's life, they have also become the epitome of distraction and addiction. The dependence people have on their phones has become so great that they are willing to risk their lives, driving blind for a couple seconds, going 60 mph, just to text back "" LOL.""

Although these law are in place, they still don't stop people from checking their notifications on their phones. Even with a two second checking of ones phone, it can cause their chances of crashing to become higher. If you are driving at 55mph and you looking away for 5 seconds, it'll be like driving the distance of a football field. This means that you possess a large risk to not only yourself, but everyone driving around you. 1.6 million people each year are involved in car crashes and a large portion of these crashes are due to cell phone usage.

One of the obvious consequences of texting and driving is one's inevitable death. Texting and driving, or just merely scrolling through your notifications puts yourself and others at risk since it's basically like driving blindfolded for a couple seconds. But people don't realize this, they'll see a clear road and then decide to pick up their phones. However, anything can happen within those few seconds. Texting and driving poses a threat to others on the road as well, so even if the car crash wasnt fatal on your end, you could have taken someone else's life. Another consequence of texting and driving involves non-fatal injuries. Although some car crashes on non-fatal, injuries are prevalent. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. A broken arm, concussion, lacerations, are some of the many injuries that are common after a collision. But there are some injuries that are far worse. Some people end up paralyzed, mute, and some even lose recollections of past memories. Imagine forgetting who you were, your family and friends, all for a simple text message.

On a different note, these car accidents are indeed preventable. States like Georgia are stepping up and passing laws to reduce the number of car accidents with the hands-free law. As previously mentioned, the number of car accidents have declined. Fatal crashes were down 6 percent in 2018, said Harris Blackwood, director of the Georgia Governor's Office of Highway Safety. And for those who are caught using their phone while driving are given a pretty hefty fine. Additionally, on a more market scale, there are hands free devices available for purchase such as bluetooth earphones for calls and windshield phone mounts. Furthermore, the newer cars that are coming out are now embedding technology into the cars system to prevent drivers from using their phone. Drivers can easily browse through music, answer phone calls, and navigate to their desired destination.

A life can be lost by simply responding to a text or peeping at a notification. It's not worth it to risk your life just because you decided to look at your phone for a couple seconds. It's also not worth it to be on life support the rest of your life because you were recording a video to upload on snap that never ended up being uploaded. You also have the life of others in your hands when you make the decision to use your cellular device while driving. It's like driving under the influence but you're blindfolded. Life is already short to be texting and driving. It can wait, it's better to come home to your family than to not come home at all.

As of 2017, an estimated 270 million people have a cell phone in the United States. Cell phones have been an everyday object that is addictive and is used for the majority of a day. In particular, cell phones are commonly used while driving, even though it sounds dangerous.

Driving requires focus on the road as well as the driver's surroundings and using cell phones while driving prevents that from occurring. Cell phones should not be used while driving because of the many dangers that tend to result from it.

Cell phones are extremely distracting because of the large amount of focus operating one requires. While driving, cell phones divert a driver's visual focus from the road to the screen of the mobile device which is very dangerous. The driver isn't able to see what's in front of them because their eyes are locked in on the screen of a cell phone which can possibly lead to a variety of negative outcomes. Texting while driving can lead to harm to health, government involvement, and vehicular harm.'

1 out of every 4 car accidents are caused by texting while driving and in the United States over 1.6 million car crashes occur annually. That means that every year over 400,000 car accidents result from texting and driving. Cell phone usage itself has a very negative impact on the body's health due to the blue light it transmits. The blue light hurts the eyes and is extremely detrimental while texting and driving. A driver must have good eyesight so that they are aware of their surroundings but using cell phones/mobile devices while driving hinders that. Studies have shown that texting while driving makes a driver lose focus more on the road than a driver being under the influence. Cell phone usage is very harmful because if an accident happens , then several degrees of physical injuries can occur and death can happen if the injuries that result are too serious to treat. Cell phone usage while driving should not be allowed due to the risk it has on the health of a driver.

In most states, texting while driving has become illegal due to the many health risks that result from it. Police officers have the ability to give a driver a citation/ticket for texting while driving. However, a significantly large number of drivers have found a loophole to evade getting a ticket and/or citation. They would not text and drive but instead they would have their cell phones in their hand but not actually text and drive. In order to counteract this loophole, some states have enforced a policy which states that a driver can be penalized for being in possession of a cell phone/mobile device when the vehicle is in motion. These policies are implemented so that no harm can occur due to cell phone usage while driving.

Using cell phones or mobile devices while driving can negatively impact the vehicle that a driver is driving whether it be a coupe, sedan, crossover, minivan, or truck. Texting while driving can lead to the quality of the vehicle declining due to any damage it may face such as a wreck. On the financial side, the vehicle's interest rate will most likely increase because texting while driving can lead to receiving tickets and/or citations that a driver potentially may receive.

The vehicle itself is something that the driver should bring into consideration and not use their cell phone/device while driving so that no harm comes to the vehicle.

The concept of using cell phones/mobile devices while driving is one that needs to get rid of immediately. There are countless outcomes that result from cell phone usage while driving and all of them are negative ones which shows that it should be banned. The health risks are severe as well as the vehicular risks and the government has had to step in because of the realization that using cell phones while driving is a lose-lose situation no matter what.

Its everywhere, and it`s not a safe habit to get use too. Matter in fact 1 out of 3 car wrecks are from people being on their cell phones not paying any attention to the road.

Cell phones have evolved over the years and I thinks that is what is so bad about them because they keep getting these better updates and things and people just feel the need to carry it or be on it where ever they go. Don't get me wrong, cell phones are a nice thing to have on you but you got to remember their not going to save you. They are they for you to use, you control yourself so you take the action and set the cell phone down whenever you get in the car to drive.

05EA79FC1DDE,"Operating a cellular device at the same time as handling a vehicle is so dangerous, due to texting and driving becoming the leading cause of death among teenage drivers, one out of every four car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving, that boils down to roughly eight people being killed each day and roughly one thousands one hundred and sixty-one injuries in crashes that involved distracted driving.

Texting and driving appears to be a significant problem among young drivers. Studies show that drivers on a mobile phone reduce their visual scanning of the road ahead, are more likely to weave within their lane on bends, and are slower to respond to hazards. It is important to go ahead and deal with this issue for young adults now, so that they can break this habit and not have to deal with any future issues.

Due to the constant concern of this matter, many states have decided to enforce a hands free law. The different stats in the United States that have enforced this law are, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia plus Washington, D.C.

Laws and facts show several reasons why it is unsafe to text and drive, but when it narrows down, the driver must take under consideration the different situations that can affect them self and others in the vehicle as well. Younger drivers do not realize the importance of considering the passengers, other motorists, or pedestrians, there are so many things that can happen around a moving vehicle, and just the slightest move can have the worse outcome for everyone.

Although there are certain laws about the matter, most drivers either avoid the law or do not fully understand the importance of it. There are other ways to get through to someone about this matter, such as, telling someone about how uncomfortable it is, or how risky it can be, another way is just simply taking the phone from them.

In conclusion, driving while on a phone is something that should be strictly advised against, the next time someone gets in a vehicle and is preparing to drive away, they should think to themself about what could happen if they acknowledge the little device in their lap, think more responsibly and get to the destination safely.

C01F40E7CEE8,"I think that drivers should not be able to operate while on the road because they can get easily distracted, they don't pay attention and could crash, they can fatally harm the people on the road. There have been a lot of different accidents because of people working on the road on their phone, or just not doing their jobs right from the start.

Drivers get easily distracted when using their phone to make calls for business.

According to EdgarSnyder. com the average amount of car crashes from using cell phones are about 1.6 million a year. The site also said that 94% of people support the ban for texting and driving. If drivers work on the road they are more likely to take phone calls or texts while driving, and that may result in a crash or an accident of some sort.

On average there are 1.25 million deaths yearly by automobile. With people working on the road that average is going to double faster. Being able to talk on the phone or texting while driving with more people adding everyday to work on the road the more people that work on the road the more likely there is to be an accident, and the more accidents, the higher fatality rate. People will quit their jobs to work on the road and make money, From July to September about 2.4% of people voluntarily quit their jobs. Of the 7 billion people in the world 2.4% quit their jobs and that rate will grow fast.

A lot of jobs that require working on the road like Uber, Lyft, Uber eats, Doordash, all have requirements for the job. Different companies have different ways of working, but most of the employees don't really pay attention to the rules because they think they don't need them.

For those who don't pay attention or follow the rules, they suffer the consequences. Driving is an important part of people and their jobs as they commute to work every single day. If there are any distractions that take away the commute then there should not be a lot of people working on the road.

In conclusion i think that people should not be able to work on the road. Drivers get easily distracted, they don't pay attention, they don't do their jobs. Working on the roads can get very distracting. Working on the road is very dangerous. It is very life threatening.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

American teens shouldn't have the privilege of using their phone while driving. The most leading cause of death for American teens is texting and driving crashes. 21% of teens were killed in car accidents because they were distracted by their cell phone. Americans are beginning to believe the fatalities are from distractions from digital devices and undeveloped brains in their teen state.

For instance, the average student checks their phone every 8.6 minutes. This is especially dangerous because when they're leaving school, their instinct is to scrutinize their messages as they're driving.

There are already people on the road who can't drive well, so by decreasing phone access to all, not just teen, we can minimize car accidents. Because of teens undeveloped brains, they are not likely to think of the dangers around them.

Therefore, ""research evidence reveals for example that a sixteen-year-old brain is not completely developed it fully developed at the age of 25."" The evidence from the passage shows how early we are able to drive at such an immature state of mine. The passage also states, ""When teens are speeding, brain researchers maintain, their brains thrill center is working perfectly but the part of your brain that weighs risk is not yet fully developed.""

This evidence shows, teenagers at the age of 16 are being very careless on the road then being careful. Teenagers being careless on the road causes many fatalities of teens, which flows right into the next topic.

In Conclusion, proceeding more precautions can also decrease teen deaths. In this topic it really all comes down to how the lawmakers want to pursue this problem. That being said the USA must figure out a way to fix this major problem with teens being addicted to their phones.

I believe that cell phones should not be able to be used while in control of a car. There are many reasons and evidence to support my statement. Across the country there are laws that are being made about the dangers of the use of the cell phone. The reasoning is that when you are in use of the cell phone while driving it significantly increases your chance of getting into an accident. Car accidents are the leading death of teenagers these days because they are too distracted looking at their phone, rather than paying attention to the road.

Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from texting and driving. Texting and driving delays your reaction time as much as driving under the influence of alcohol. There are many other opportunities for you to be able to get in touch with someone if it is urgent. There is new technology that has been created such as handsfree technology. There is Bluetooth, that will connect your phone to your call to make hands free texts and calls, if needed.

If you get into a car wreck because of texting and driving, your insurance rate will increase. The increase depends on many factors. Insurers follow the Insurance Services Offices standard of increasing a premium by twenty to forty percent of the insurer's base rate after an accident. If you avoid texting and driving you will not have to worry about your insurance going up, but you also you will not have to worry about your life or anyone in the passenger seat of your car.

In conclusion, I believe that you should not be able to use the cellphone while driving. There are many laws and reasons on why it should start being illegal everywhere. People just need to start thinking about their lives and the other people around them, when they start to make decisions. They should realize that there are consequence that come with our decisions.

It's the first thing they look at in the morning and the last thing they see before sleep. This electronic takeover has had a very big affect on distracted driving, causing many innocent lives to be lost all because of a Text message. Driving is a skill that requires constant focus on the road and the others on the road with you. Carless or negligent driving doesn't just affect the person doing the act, it also effects everyone around the distracted driver.

Texting and driving incidents are one of the most reported problems in the US right now. In 2013, 3,154 people were killed in distraction-related crashes, about 424,000 people were injured in crashes involving a distracted driver and 10% of all drivers ages 15 to 19 involved in fatal accidents were reported to be distracted at the time of the crash. Distracted driving has had a huge impact on many young Impressionable drivers who are very prone to starting bad habits that may lead to accidents involving other drivers on the road. Phones should not be involved with driving because they are simply too distracting and there is clear evidence that supports it, many lives can be saved and avoid all the pointless pain and agony caused to the people involved.

There are laws set in place to protect us that make sure people aren't distracted while driving, and if they are there are consequences that could even result in the revocation of their licenses. I believe these laws benefit society as a whole. If we were to not have these laws, then the death rates in the US would sky-rocket past the limits they already are. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year and texting while driving is 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk.

With a problem that is so avoidable I hope that people can come together and realize what texting and driving is doing to the world and that all we have to do is follow the law and stay focused while driving to not only protect ourselves, but all the innocents around us. Together everyone can make a change by making the right decision when on the road.

Cell phone can be a very dangerous thing while blowing DUI accidents out of the park. Some say that drinking and driving is more dangerous but let these facts tell you otherwise.

Even though phones are said to be used during emergencies only driving down a two-lane road on snapchat is not an emergency. Texting and driving has 6 times the accident rate than drinking and driving. There is at least one death everyday due to cell phones, you could be next if your using your cell phone. That risk becomes 4 times greater just by picking your phone up. Another reason not to pick up your phone if you were to get in an accident and survive your insurance cost will drastically go up.

While using headphones in Georgia is illegal the use of a hands-free device is legal. If it does not involve your hands being used, then you are allowed to use them. For example, blue tooth devise is highly recommended.

We need ways to prevent the usage of a cellular device while out on the road a great way to do this is; to keep your phone out of reach. Put it in your trunk or even in a glove box so you are not tempted to grab it. Keep your phone on silent or shut your phone completely off so you will not be distracted by an incoming call or message.

Being on the phone while driving has become a nationwide problem. This problem is due to the increase of the relationship between phone and man. Humans have become more in tuned with their phones rather than paying attention to what is happening in front of them. The cell phone makes the driver lose focus of the road causing many problems. People should not be allowed to use the phone while driving because lives are being loss while people are texting and driving and it is dangerous for everyone on the road. There are two main solutions for preventing using the phone while driving which are either having more police patrol units out to help monitor the roads or having the person set up a self-control system for themselves.

The first prevention method is to have more police patrolling the roads as a way of moderating cell phone usage while people are driving. When people see the police, there is an instant nervous feeling that follows. Instilling fear of tickets or even the idea of going to jail within the people could help control the problem of cell phones and driving. If people see that police are watching, they will instantly do the right thing. Police patrolling can help decrease the numbers of distracted drivers on the road, ensure the safety of the drivers themselves and the people around them.

Setting up units around the road could not only help with distracted driving but also help with situations that put others at risk while being on the road.

These patrol units could be of benefit for numerous problems but distracted driving being the most important. Although it is not an immediate reform to the problem, it is a start for correction.

The final prevention method is to have the people set up self-control systems that not only will ensure the safety of themselves, but the people around them. There are many different systems that can be put in place. One of the first things the driver could do is turn the phone off completely. This will ensure that there is no way the person can use the phone or react to any incoming notifications. If a person is not comfortable with the phone being completely off, then having the phone on silent is the next recommended response to be performed. This can help the driver focus more on the road because the sound of the phone's notifications are not distracting. This is not as effective as turning off the phone because depending on the location of the phone, the driver may be able to see the phone screen light up. If this occurs then the driver can be distracted. The most recommended self-control system is to have the phone completely turned off because it is fully assured that the phone will not be aiding in the problem of distracted driving.

In conclusion, people should not be allowed to use their phones while driving. Driving while distracted is a safety problem that can be corrected. One way of correcting distracted driving with cell phones is to have police units set up on the road watching for any signs of cell phone usage during driving. These police units can ensure the safety of drivers on the road and even pedestrians. There is also the method of drivers setting up their own self-control system. These systems allow for the driver to be responsible for his or her own actions that help with the reforms of distracted driving. The two systems are turning the phone off or having the phone on silent. Turning the phone off is a secure solution for distracted driving because the driver will not have any interaction with the phone. Silencing the phone is the next recommended solution because this allows for the diver to concentrate on the road with a clear mind. These solutions to the problem of distracted driving may not be immediate, but they are a start to helping decrease the dangers that are triggered when distracted driving occurs.

It has gotten so bad that texting and driving has replaced drinking and driving as lead cause of death among teen drivers. The reason is because teenagers are barely starting to drive, when they decide to use their phone while behind the wheel it distracts them from the road.

However, this is not only with teens, people no matter what age cannot and should not be multitasking while driving. They need to be aware of all their surroundings.

There have been many incidents that have to do with this. For example, a teen from

Minnesota drove past a red light and killed the other driver plus his 10-year-old daughter. Also, a driver of a pickup truck collided with a church bus in Texas. This ended up with 13 people dead.

Using your phone while driving is considered illegal in 46 states not including Arizona,

Montana, Texas and Missouri. If busted, fines range from 20 to 500 dollars. It all depends on the state. Some states consider it a criminal misdemeanor which can result in jail or prison time. To avoid any accidents or any tickets there are different things you can do. You can ignore your phone for the car ride or leave it in the back seat so you're not tempted. You can always ride with someone and ask them to check your phone for you. If you need your phone for GPS and you're by yourself, you can always invest in a phone holder that connects to your window. This way you can see where you need to go but you're not distracting yourself by touching it and putting all your focus on that.

Cell Phones have become a more modern technology which is why people have become more comfortable using them while driving. It is distraction that could end up being fatal. Not only are car accidents a result of using a cellphone while driving,but it also can cause road rage from other drivers,and traffic jams. People believe that they can multitask but truly the brain switch from one task to another which is not really multitasking. Cell phones should be banned while driving for a couple of different reasons. There are a lot of dangers when it comes to using a phone while driving.

While driving you should never look away from the road. It is one of the most important factors when driving. Not only are you putting yourself in danger,but also the lives of other drivers and pedestrians. Texting while driving is one of the leading causes of death to people age 16-25. If you are texting your eyes are not on the road and your hands are not on the steering wheel. There a lot of different distractions such as smoking,eating,looking in the mirror,talking,and loud music. That could cause a car accident. But texting while driving has made its way to the top of the list.

Most people believe that hands-free electronics are not a distraction and don't pose danger to drivers but they actually do. Whether a person is texting or just talking, they are not focused on the road and this slows their reaction time. People think that if they are just talking and listening, with eyes still on the road, not taking them off, that they are just as alert as a driver not talking on a cell phone. But that is not the case a study showed that ""In 2001, they found that even hands-free cell phone use distracted drivers. In 2003, they revealed a reason: Drivers look but do not see, because they are distracted by the conversation. The scientists also found previously that chatty motorists are less adept than drunken drivers with blood alcohol levels exceeding 0.08. (Britt)"". Which provides evidence that drivers using a hands-free device are just as distracted as one who is texting.

E8AA57299B26,"Texting and driving has been the cause of so many deadly accidents, looking down at your phone for what you think is just a second could change your life forever. So many die every day from a car crashed caused by texting and driving. Whether it's you doing it or someone else on the road it could still change your life forever. Its so sad to think that you could lose your life at any moment while being in a car just riding down the road and get hit by someone that is on their phone while they are driving. If you are in the car with someone and they are on their phone, ask them to put it down... save a life or even your own life.

It's so sad to know that there are people out there that are that selfish to be on their phone while they are driving and not fully understand the consequences of it. The law enforcement here these last couple of years have really buckled down on the no phone while operating a vehicle law. They have just recently passed a law that you cant even have your phone on person while driving. If you get pulled over and you have it anywhere around you, you can get a big ticket. It's not even worth it in my opinion, the text or call can wait.

The newer vehicles are making them now where you can connect them through Bluetooth on your phone and send messages and calls through just saying it over the speaker. I have an older model Malibu, and it doesn't have all of the fantsy stuff but it does have Bluetooth and ""ONstar"" which is where you can call and talk over the phone instead of being on your phone. So many people I know have been in wrecks and the cause of it are phones. Phones are addicting and I want to be on mine all the time, but I know when I'm driving I don't need to be on mine because I can barely focus on the road much less my phone and the road.

My down the line cousin got in a wreck and killed someone for a couple of reasons, one being the cause of having the phone up to his hear. This young girl was coming back from college in Cartersville, and my cousin was driving coming back from his friends house and he wasn't paying attention to see the girl coming and pulled out right in front of her, and killed her. They saw that one of the causes was because of cell phone use and other things that were in his system... and he got charged with vehicular homicide. Which is killing someone while driving. My cousin is not a killer at all but he was on the phone while he was driving and killed someone from not having his full attention on the road.

Cars are really dangerous anyway, and hard to control sometimes, and adding a phone in that equation doesn't make sense. Some people do drugs they are illegal, but it's a matter of not caring, and being addicted. That's kind of the same thing about the texting and driving. Some people just don't care, and some just are too addicted to get off of it while they are driving. I'm not saying I am a perfect angel myself because I have been on my phone while I've been driving before but I don't do it often, because I know what it can do and cause, and that's not what I want at all.

Do you think anybody that ever hit someone while being on the phone and driving thought that they were actually going to HIT SOMEONE?!? No. It happens instantly, you won't even expect it. People should not be able to be on their phone no matter what they're doing while driving. Phones become a distraction and can have you hurting someone innocent in the blink of an eye.

The National Safety Council says that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Many people die and others are in critical condition. All because you had to send one text? Answer one phone call? Take a selfie? Neither of those are worth it when it come to one's life. That's not all though, According to statistics texting and driving are 6x more likely to get you into a car accident than driving drunk. Why is this? While under the influence of alcohol you are in the wrong state of mind but you still have the slightest ability to remain focused when being on your phone you become distracted. Many believe that we can multitask but according to nsc. org that is a myth. Our brain does not have the ability to multitask instead "" the brain handles tasks sequentially, switching between one task and another. Brains can juggle tasks very rapidly, which leads us to erroneously believe we are doing two tasks at the same time. In reality, the brain is switching attention between tasks - performing only one task at a time.""

There are other ways that you can void out using your phone and driving but buying things like bluetooths. You can talk on the phone without tampering anything or taking your eyes off the roads. Cars has also been more modernized to help fight this problem for example according to huffingtonpost. com ""Ford's SYNC operating system, for example, sends texts dictated by the driver and reads incoming texts aloud; its MyKey feature allows parents to block calls and texts when teens are driving. GM is reportedly developing eye-tracking technology that can detect when drivers glance away at a text. Earlier this year, BMW unveiled plans for gesture controls that will allow drivers to point at the vehicle's navigation screen to take a call."" Even phones are being update as to where you can text and navigate through your phone while not looking and being on it. These adjustments are not being made for nothing. Take advantage because using your phone while driving is not dangerous to only someone else but to you as well!

In Conclusion we should not be allowed to use our phones while being behind the road no matter what we're doing. It is simply dangerous and is a big distraction to the human brain. We can hurt ourselves and others in the blink of an eye over something that can be ignored until we get to our destination.

3F9644F1A9EF,"Required Essay 2: Phones & Driving

Cell phones have became a necessity of our lives. Research says cell phones are the main factors that causes car accidents. Studies also shows that a cell phone put drivers at a greater risk of a crash. Instead of worrying about the dangers of cell phone usage while driving, people still use their cell phones because they just can't seem to keep their attention off the devices and keep in touch with other people. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are many evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking & texting while driving because it isn't safe at all.

According to the National Safety Council, 1.2 million car crashes in 2013 involved drivers talking on the phone, and at least 341,000 involved text messaging. Texting while driving statistics show that using a device while operating your vehicle is becoming life-threatening. Talking or texting while driving or checking your social media posts takes eyes off the road and you lose focus of the road and the task of driving. Since teen lack driving skills and aren't really experienced with driving, cell phone use can be especially deadly for teen drivers.

It's absolutely important to avoid these incidents, you first have to learn to stay off your device. Along with being able to pay better attention to what's in front of you, you'd be less likely to have a crash. In addition to this you should complete any call or text before starting the car. As well as getting directions and try to visualize the destination before starting the car and driving. Furthermore check in with friends or parents only after you've arrived to your destination safely.

Cell phone use behind the wheel shortens brain activity with driving. Typing text messages shortens a driver's ability to direct attention to the road, and react to traffic situations. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones while they are in their cars because they are not reliable. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices in your vehicle because you should give your full attention to what's around you. It's safer to use a hands free device so you won't have to reach for your phone, or connect a watch to your phone so all your texts and calls would come through.

In conclusion, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of road fatalities will continue to increase. It is our responsibility to not incur other people's live because of one mistake that could impact someone else greatly.                                     ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6
2CBF7077CE7B,"The debate over whether or not drivers should be allowed to use their cellphones while behind the wheel has been a very popular topic throughout recent years. With factual evidence to support both claims, people seem to be pretty evenly split when it comes to which side of the debate that they support. I personally believe that when driving, drivers should NOT be allowed to use their cellphones in any way, shape, or form. Driving while distracted by you cellphone is too dangerous and causes too many injuries and casualties to be allowed.

First of all, when you are driving and you have to perform all of your tasks for the phone manually, you are creating a distraction for yourself. This takes your attention away from the road and increases your chance of causing a wreck. According to the NSC, there are 1.6 million crashes and 390,000 injuries each year caused by cell phone usage while driving. This means that 390,000 of people's ""loved-ones"" were injured in a crash caused by texting and driving.

What if it was your ""loved-one"" that was about to become part of the statistic? What if it was you that was about to become part of the statistic?

Now, you might be thinking ""Some cars now have the ability to connect the phone to the speakers via bluetooth, which gives the ability to talk on the phone while not being in contact."" If you were thinking this, you would be right. This does indeed reduce the risks caused by holding the phone and doing everything ""hands-on."" But, you are still going to be taking attention away from the road and putting it towards the phone when you give a command or you make a phone call. Also, not every car has this feature, therefore some people would get distracted trying to come up with a solution of how to talk on the phone without being in contact with the phone.

What most people don't realize is that the solution is right in front of their faces- ""Wait until you aren't driving.""

Luckily, governments are realizing the dangers of distracted driving, as 20 U.S. states and territories have passed ""hands-free"" laws, which are laws that prohibit being in contact with your phone while driving. Even with this being in effect, there are still going to be people that will continue to text, make calls, and more while driving. There will still be injuries and deaths caused by distracted driving from cell phones. This is why I am a firm believer that the usage of a cell phone should be completely prohibited in any shape, form, or fashion while driving. It can wait.

Having phones while driving to some is safe, while others believe that it is may be dangerous. It is helpful to have a phone while driving because many people may need it for mapping instructions or directions to get from point A to B. It is also helpful because a lot of people may need their phone to communicate in case of emergencies. However, it may prove to be dangerous to allow teenagers or young adults to have phones while they are driving. This is a controversial topic that has lead to country-wise conversation.

Having phones while driving can be extremely helpful for people who need assistance while they are driving A large number of people need phone in order to use ""Google Maps"" or other forms of navigation. Especially people who are new to driving may depend heavily on the navigation systems. There are people out in the world who do not fully understand how the highways and other major speedways work. They will be forced to use the navigation systems to help them get to where they need to go. Even though this may pose a risk to people who are distracted easily. They may want to use their phones to do other things. However, people still need to know where they are going. Being able to get where people need to go is better than being stranded or having to pay for ""Ubers"" or other forms of public transportation.

Phones also may be helpful to those who need their phones for emergencies on the road. No one knows or expects bad things to happen; so, in the event that a bad thing does happen people need to be able to make important phone calls to emergency services. If someone in the car suddenly has a heart attack, are they supposed to just drive faster and hope they make it to the hospital in time? Whoever is driving may need to call the police. Even if something bad does not happen in the car but it happens outside of the car. What if someone drives past a fire or they see a suspicious object on the side of the road; are they supposed to just assume that someone else will see it too? Phones may be dangerous but they are a necessity, whether it is on the road or in a vehicle.

While having phones while driving may be helpful to those who need GPS services, it may also prove to be dangerous to teenagers who are new to driving. Teenagers of this generation have a habit of discovering new forms of technology; especially when it comes to social media. Students of high-school level or maybe even college may fall victim to the effects that driving while having a phone may provide. When a student is driving and using the GPS at the same time, the student may want to check notifications on a topic that they were interested in. Or they may try to text back a friend before they reach a stop light. Even if the student makes the choice to text at a red light, they may end up texting after the light is green while unaware of it. This may lead to a crash, especially if it is on a main road.

Having a phone while driving is a topic that deserves further conversation and discussion. Some argue that phones are a very useful tool, especially if it is being used for GPS purposes. Some also say that phones are useful in case of emergencies. While another group suggests that phones should not be allowed for the simple fact that it is a distraction. This topic is still under discussion and no end is in sight.   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8
B1FC2DD32A88,"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis; drivers should be able to use cell phones in a restricted capacity while operating a vehicle. Using a mobile phone while driving can be distracting to most people, especially the younger generations. This makes is very dangerous and there have been horrible accidents and even deaths to happen while texting and driving in particular. While this may be a true fact, there are different ways you can control the use of cell phones while driving.

Some states have made it illegal to use a cell phone while driving and others passed laws that enable your use of cell phones restricted like Georgia and the hands free law. Some may argue that the hands free law is not safer than holding a phone while driving. I think that there are more things that can be put in place to assist with the use of cell phones and driving.

My argument is that I believe we should be able to use cell phones in a more restricted way which will eventually save lives. We currently live in a world where technology rules us as humans. I say why not allow it to rule us in a safe way. We have self-driving cars; hands free voice to type mechanisms on our devices and even most vehicles that are being made now can read your text for you as you drive. In my opinion, if we use more of these mechanisms properly it would save more lives. Self driving cars will allow us not to be worried about driving on the road; if you insist on texting and driving, why not use the voice to text feature on your phone and finally purchasing a vehicle that will read and type the text to you.

While my theories seem far fetched, I believe one day we will be able to live in a world where we will be able to operate cell phones and drive on a daily basis without getting hurt. Technology has brought us this far we should be able to go further if we invent ways to use it in a safe and responsible manner.      ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

In our modern day Society, cell phones are everywhere. We use them in all aspects of our lives. From school to work, or simply ordering a pizza. Although they are a great technological advancement, if not used properly they can become a distraction and have deadly consequences. We are about to discuss some of the reasons why cell phones and driving should not be used together.

Some people question... Why does my phone have GPS navigation yet I shouldn't use it while driving? And it is simple. When your eyes leave the road, even for a second, it becomes careless and dangerous. Most cars are now equipped with Bluetooth navigation. So anything you need while driving is at your fingertips. If need be, plan ahead and adjust your phone settings before pulling off.

A lot of younger people are losing their lives due to texting while driving. This too, can wait. If you need to send or respond to a text message then pull over. It's very, very dangerous to try to send a text, or read one, while driving. Not only that, but it is also against the law.

It is understandable that some point in time while driving, everyone will get an ""important"" phone call that can't wait. In this case, hopefully, you have already installed a hands-free device. If not, please pull over to take the call. It could mean life or death and no call, to me, is that important. Investing in Bluetooth or other hands-free devices will completely be worth it.

All in all, any type of distracted driving can be fatal. It is always best to avoid distractions such as, eating, music, texting, makeup, Etc all together. If you just can't avoid your phone while driving, turn it off completely. You can always return calls and texts later and besides no one wants to get pulled over and get a ticket for something so easily avoided.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Distracted drivers are far more dangerous t han intoxicated drivers. Being on a device can put you and other people around you in danger. Teenagersare mostly the cause of accidents knowing that most teens die due to accidents more than adults. Teen also get distracted very easil y as a cause to destruction on the road.

Society is moving toward an almost completely digital lifestyles, causing the youth to become even more involved in phones, computers, and etc. Although this ongoing innovation is an improvement, it also has made its case as a potential hazard to today's generation. Specifically, when combining the machinery of vehicles, which are capable of killing passengers at personality of cellphones, the result is fatal disaster. Basically, while cellphones are helpful technology, drivers should rarely or never use them when operating any vehicle.

Primarily, as the number of people using cell phones while driving will also increase on streets and highways. At the same time rate, drivers still talk on cell phones and send text messages while driving. They will also engaging in other activities apart from driving. For example, drives will text when driving, and they will dial numbers. Drivers will also receive calls and talk on their devices for long periods of time. Again, driving demands your full attention, and your concentration which is taken away when talking on the phone. However, it means that the driver has to divert his attention to the conversation, which leads to less concentration on the road. All in all, one can connect accidents and cell phone usage while driving to this very diversion of attention.

Furthermore, drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Ad a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. This puts both drivers and even pedestrians in harm's way.

Cell phones, we all have them, and they have become a necessity of daily life. This innocuous invention is close to cars in how much we now rely on them. There isn't any problem with this, but, these two great inventions are known for being dangerous to use together, leading to death for many. While cars already have many things to distract oneself with, from stereo to air conditioning to seat adjustment, cell phones have been the only thing to get so much attention for distracting drivers. The question is whether drivers can safely use phones while driving, the usefulness of cell phones in cars, and who usually uses their phone while driving.

To start with, drivers can safely use phones in cars, with a few caveats. First off, eyes should be kept on the road, so if you can use a phone hands-free, more power to you. Obviously, this excludes things like texting or video chat from being used, but voice calls need no such limitation. Since voice calls aren't really much different from talking to somebody else in the car, except you don't ever swivel to look at them. Then there is GPS, which can be used, but the destination and settings should only be changed while stopped, so there is no danger to oneself or others. Ultimately phones are safe to use in cars, as long as you remain conscious of yourself and your surroundings.

Cell phones are useful for so many things, such as GPS, communication, or simple entertainment. You might carry out a meeting over the phone, or find the directions to a hole in the wall restaurant. Phones can also be used in emergency situations to notify others of your location. Phones definitely have a lot of use to someone in a car, and they are fine to use.

Normally young people are most credited with using phones while driving, and while this is technically true, some thought is necessary. While young people have grown up using technology, and are much more used to using their cell phones, they have also been inundated with messages about texting and driving throughout their childhood. A fairly common occurrence, however, is that people relax their caution while tired or otherwise influenced. Just by eliminating regular distracting situations, chances of crash reduce dramatically.

When the right precautions are put into place, such as not texting and only using GPS while stopped, using the phone while driving is not too dangerous. Ultimately, it becomes the individual responsibility of people to stay safe while driving.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

You may have a car wreck, lose concentration, run off the road,etc. Cell phones have many disadvantages when texting while driving somewhere. That's why I think cell phones should be banned from driving.

However using a cell phone while driving should be illegal because you should be aware of yourself and the people around you. For example, if you get a text message from someone you can't pay attention to the road and to your phone. You can put many people lives under risk. Majority of the people will continue to do it even if they ban cell phones while driving. Some people don't see nothing wrong with texting while driving.

Their are many negative effects of texting while driving. Reading and responding to someone message makes the driver not pay attention to the road. Most people spend most of their time riding on the outside the white line. So therefore doing that activity is very harmful to the whole population. All states should make it against the law to use cell phones while driving. Some people may think they can text while they are driving and not think that it is very dangerous. However, people have to learn from their own mistakes for them to learn.

Innocent people lives are being taken because of someone else mistakes. People don't seem to notice how careless they could be while their driving. You don't necessarily have to be texting someone. For example you could be taking pictures, doing something to your radio, watching a video, etc. That's why I think using cell phones while driving should be against the law.

In conclusion, texting while driving is one of the biggest problems in the world. I think people should leave their phone alone while driving.

One reason why I think people shouldn't use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because, there's always people getting into accidents. The cell phone today is likes drug.

Drivers that text and drive or just look at their phone in general while operating their vehicle make it dangerous for other drivers and pedestrians. Drivers should not be able to use their phones at all in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it is unsafe and you can hurt not just yourself but other people as well. So many deaths have occurred because people have texted while driving a vehicle and they hurt people or even cause a death because they were paying attention to their phone instead of paying attention to the road. As a matter of fact, teens are the age group that looks at their phone while driving, not all teens do, because they grew up with technology and they take their phone wherever they go.

Teens today are distracted by their phones because they want to see what their friends are doing or what a certain celebrity is doing and it is safe if they are doing that at home but if they are looking at their phone weather it is looking at social media or texting a friend while driving that is unsafe for everyone around them. Teens should not be able to use their phones while driving or even operate a vehicle if they know they are going to look at their phone at some point. Some teens will tell you that they know how to drive while using their phone at the same time or they would probably even tell you that they have been looking at their phone while driving for so long that they have not been in an accident, but even if that is the case those teens should not be able to drive because as stated so many times now, it is unsafe to text/ look at your phone while operating a vehicle because it is unsafe. On the other hand, you may look at your phone to help you out instead of letting your phone distract you while driving a vehicle.

One exception, even though it is still dangerous, that you can look at your phone for not too long is if you are using your GPS to help you get to your destination. On everyone's phone there is a GPS app and a lot of people use that to their advantage to help them get to where they want to be if they have never been there before or even the opposite if they are somewhere that they have never been before they can use their GPS to help them guide them back home. Furthermore, using your GPS while driving is still dangerous because you are taking your eyes off of the road, even if it is only for a few seconds, it is still dangerous even though your using your GPS to help you out to get to your destination. Ultimately, using your phone while operating a vehicle is dangerous even if you are using your GPS to your benefit to help you out, it is still dangerous.

In conclusion, texting while driving or just looking at your phone in general is dangerous for not only you and the passengers in car but also for the people outside of the car and for the other drivers. Phones are useful for so many things like downloading games or watching videos but drivers should not be able to use that phone in any capacity. So many deaths have occurred because people have looked at their phone while driving but the age group that uses their phone and look at their phone while driving are teens because they want to text a friend or check on their social media; one exception, even though it is still dangerous, is using the GPS on your phone to help you get to your destination. To summarize, drivers should not be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle.

ED997081E3E5,"Should drivers be able to be on their devices while operating a vehicle? Even tho cell phones today sources to everything now from just communicating with people long distance to the internet to also getting around. In the times of today people would even walk across the street looking because they are distracted by their phones. Which is saying if people that are walking don't even pay attention to where they're walking or if they are about to get hit by a car drivers would do the same if they were on their phones.

It's will be difficult for most people to stay focused on the roads if they were able to use their phones and to drive at the same time. It has became a habit today to not be able to stay off of your phones. Apple has updated phones to where when you're driving it won't send notifications and will lock your phone for you so you won't have to become distracted. The only that will work while you're driving if needed is the gps of maps. A good idea for people who also get distracted and for teenage drivers the group that gets in the most accidents so it'll be helpful for them too when on the road.

Eventually, new models in cars is driving hands-free not always hands free but for a quick second or even a minute. Drivers aren't able to look away from their phones even when their phones are locked they have to just to see if a notification has popped up on their phones. It has become a little bit of a good idea so the driver and other's could be safe on the road, worried that drivers may abuse the power of the hands free control button and not use it responsibility and things can still lead to accidents. It's not much people can do to stop people from using their phones while driving because people are addicted and are willing to take the risks to look at one simple message.

Therefore drivers shouldn't be allowed to be on their phones while operating a vehicle so they won't put themselves and others in danger of being killed on the road. There are laws and even phone companies are trying to do something about it so other won't be in harm. It's also the drivers choice either they follow or not hopefully to actually encourage driver's to be cautious of accidents and who they might hurt.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Mostly today all of us are on our phone and some people cannot focus on driving instead just begin in their phones. I think that people should be able to use their phone while driving while operating a vehicle. It can cause us to get distracted while we are sending a text to someone but there is a car coming in beside you and you do not notice them you don't have enough time to react. I think that most people would say that it was the others car fault, but we must be able to focus on only driving nothing else. Also, if you see a pedestrian you must be alert if they are crossing the road and do not slow down then it can cause you to hit them while texting. The pedestrian thought is that you would slow down so they can cross across the road so they will not be thinking about you still going forward. Some of the states are making it illegal to text and call others while operating a vehicle because I feel that your reaction time is slow which causes you not to focus on one thing. Also, because if you behind a car and the other car hits the brakes but you will have no time to react on the brakes, but causes you to hit the other car but you will get the blame because you had enough time to push the brakes. I feel like if you are talking on the phone you might be concentrated on driving and talking but texting does not give enough time to look on your phone and driving with the other hand I feel like that is what can cause you to wreck. These are the main reasons that I think that people should use their phone can cause distractions while operating a vehicle even though some people think it does not distract them.

CDF90A57A956,"Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people.

Taking eyes off the road while driving is one of the first lessons that is taught to a driver in his early driver's education. Drivers who talk while driving do not pay attention to road and thus end up in an accident. They put not only their life in danger but other drivers and pedestrians. Text messaging while driving is a bigger danger than talking on a phone while driving. While texting, the drivers have to completely divert their attention from road to their cell phone and their hands from the steering wheel to the cell phone.

Hands free devices are used to avoid accidents, but recent studies shows it is in the leading cause of accidents while cell phone car chargers force the driver to take both of his hands off the steering wheel to car charger and cell phone and thus loses control of vehicle and putting life in danger.

So what I'm going to be explaining why people should leave their phones alone in the car. I also am going to explain the consequences if you play on your phone in the car. I'm also explaining why you should stay focused driving. I am also teaching you about clicking your seatbelt, so sit back and take notes.

The reason you should leave your phone alone, because you're putting people in danger. For example ""say you're driving and texting and take your eyes off the road, Then Boom! You just killed yourself and someone else. I think that if we check phones when we stop the vehicle we can stop wrecks from happening. You should always keep your eyes on the road, because what if a big garbage truck runs into you because you weren't paying attention. So that's the reason you shouldn't text while driving.

You also shouldn't text and drive. There are 27,000 wrecks a day and most are from texting and driving. Like its crazy people don't understand your putting lives in danger including yourself. How can we as people to get the unfocused people to understand that this activity their doing is dangerous and serious. Like I really hope people come to their senses and realize their live and everybody else are important. Remember people you're live is more important than material things.

I really think we need to get this through people head. Because last year 36,750 died from car wrecks like do they want to be added to the count. They need to come to their senses and ask there selves ""is it really worth it"", because what's more important your life or a text. You should also fasten your seatbelt when driving or riding in a car. Because in 2017 6 out of 10 occupants have died in car wrecks for not having their seatbelts fasten. So if you were to have your seatbelt off and text and drive it's a possibility you could get hurt very bad or die.

So now that I've explained the consequences of this activity that should stop. I want you to think about the actions you do have consequences so make better choices. So I hope you come to your senses and take notes on how to be safe in your vehicle. Stay focused and put your seat belt on, because you wouldn't want to risk it all over something crazy.                  ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Today people use their cell phones for everything like texting, talking, setting dates, and internet use. Large problems that are going on are caused by cell phones while driving. To help the issue with so many car crashes there have been new rules to prevent crashes. Cell phones have become a key part of people's lives today.

Unfortunately, while people are driving they are choosing the wrong time to be using their phones. People today are so focused on their phones they are risking their lives and other people's lives. We are required to focus as much on the road as possible. If people would drive without being on the phone less people will be harmed. If you need to handle something important on the phone you should pool over on the side. This will probably cause less car crashing and less people getting hurt. You can even cause an accident by just checking your phone for a quick second. A second is all you need to cause an accident. You are putting yourself and others in harmful situations.

As you can see driving while texting is very bad. It can cause a lot of damage to you and the other person in the other car. As you are looking at the effect and damage that phones and driving cause. We should improve it. To where people are not getting harmed on the road. When we pick up the phone we should think about the lives that will be lost.

Did you know that it only takes a couple of seconds to park your car? Did you know that having your cell phone in your hand is illegal in today's time? I am against people using their cell phones while they are operating a vehicle.

To start off, there are several things that could happen if you choose to use your cell phone while driving. You could run off the road, you could hit someone else's car, or you could hit an actual person. You never know what could happen if you choose to pick up your phone. You should consider other motorists. You should consider protecting the pedestrians. You should consider your passengers. You should defiantly consider yourself.

Using your cell phone while driving is something that you shouldn't do. You never know what other lives you could affect just because you want to use your phone. Maybe you think, it will just be for a few seconds to text someone back but in those few seconds your life can change tremendously. It only takes a few seconds to park your car. Instead of taking your own life and someone else's in those few seconds, you can park your car and then use your phone. The vehicles can be replaced but the people inside those vehicles can't.

Finally, using your phone while driving is illegal. If you choose to use your phone, you are going to end up having to pay a ticket, living with the regret of hurting other people around you and living with pain because of the minute you needed on your phone. Whoever you think you must respond to or look at, would much rather you make it to your destination in one piece then responding to their text or call.

That person would want you to wait until you are parked than to take someone else's life and your own.

In conclusion, it all comes down to using your phone while driving or not. I hope you always remember that one text, call, or scroll is not worth it. Keep your eyes on the road and always give behind the wheel, all your effort. No one wants to get into a car wreck, sometimes it does happen but don't let the reason of it be, you are using your phone.

The age of technology is upon humanity and is affecting the species far more than anyone has expected. With more modernized devices being released at such a fast pace, it is not likely that one human of five will not have one. Technology, especially the usage of smart phones, has become ultimately distracting to humans. Operating a vehicle, however, is not the time to be distracted. Any driver, no matter the experience or skill, should not be able to use a cellular device while operating a motor vehicle because it is hazardous to themselves and others, and it is a leading cause of death.

To begin with, the distraction of a cellular device is most dangerous to the driver. Not only are they putting their life on the line to send a text or view a snapchat, they are also putting their license up for suspension and possible jail time because it is an illegal activity. Any impairment of a driver is an illegal act and can be tried in the court of law.

These drivers willingly know the consequences when they pull out their phone. It is important that the driver adhere to the responsibility bestowed upon them for the safety of themselves and others. Any mistakes made while moving are solely the driver's fault. A text or a call cannot amount to the value of a life, and the act of texting while driving is just as dangerous as drinking and driving. In other words, it would be thought that driving while using a phone would be less of an issue. However, it is one of the number one causes of death.

Moreover, the management of a cellphone while driving is one of the main causes of death today. These on-going issues have led to ""1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving."" (The National Safety Council Texting and Driving Statistics - Distracted Driving).

Not only are these wrecks traumatic to everyone involved, they effect the loved ones of those who got injured or died.

With such high stats, humans have began working to fix this matter in question. Many modern cars have come out with Bluetooth in the radio system which assists the driver with using his or her phone without actually using their phone. Bluetooth allows drivers to play music, text, and call all with minimal work applied. This update in technology can be seen as a breakthrough in modern advancements; but, it also has its faults that come along with it.

While managing to make the Bluetooth setting work, drivers can also find themselves just as distracted. Losing focus for five seconds or more on the road increases the risk of accidents and injuries. Looking somewhere else other than the road is just another second that the driver is not looking at oncoming traffic or pedestrians.

To conclude, a driver should not be allowed to use a cellular device while managing or operating a moving vehicle due to the risk of harming themselves as well as others, and the fact that it is illegal today and everyday following. Being a hazard on the road makes a hazard for everywhere around it. In this period of time, humans are developing technology to prevent this topic from happening in the future; however, until fully preventable, it should not be permitted.

Many people take chances and put other people's lives in danger by using their cellphones while driving. Numerous deaths and injuries occur from those driving and using cell phones simultaneously. Using cellphones while driving causes needless accidents. It is almost impossible to efficiently multitask. The harm and effects of the accidents and deaths are far reaching. Drivers should not be able to use cellphones while driving.

Sadly, numerous people are killed or injured annually due to accidents. Specifically, many deaths are caused by car accidents and the accidents are from teens and even grown individuals using their cell phones while operating a motor vehicle. In 2015, studies showed that about 72% of deaths were caused by accidents and about 44% of the accidents were caused because the teen was driving a motor vehicle while using their cellular device.

For many, driving is a daily activity, not requiring much thought or consideration. However, the sad reality is that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to fatal car crashes (Teen). Texting while driving has become the number one driving distraction for many people. Drivers need to be aware of the dangers and keep their attention on the road, not on their cell phones or other mobile devices.

It has been proven that one cannot successfully multitask. While it might seem like you are accomplishing many things at once, research has shown that our brains are not nearly as good at handling multiple tasks as we like to think we are. In fact, some researchers suggest that multitasking can actually reduce productivity by as much as 40 percent (Teen). This means that someone operating a motor vehicle cannot operate the vehicle and use their phone at the same time without an accident happening or losing concentration of the road while trying it. In 2019, 36% of respondents (aged 18-24) admitted to texting while driving. Of those who admitted to texting while driving, 51%. In 2019, an individual that was operating a motor vehicle and also on their cellular device at the same time lost control of the wheel and as they were losing control of the wheel spun out, causing them to merge over into a lake and died because of drowning (McCartt AT, Oesch NJ, Williams AF, and Powell TC). Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes which proves why multitasking is nearly impossible to do successfully and why it should not be done while driving.

The effects of the accidents that drivers are causing are horrific because the effects that the accidents and deaths caused are far reaching. Drivers should not be using cellphones while driving because not only is it life threatening, but it also can be life changing. In 2016, there was an incident that happened when a car rammed into the back of another vehicle (2016). The person whose car was hit was rushed to the hospital immediately. This person was paralyzed for the rest of his life. This man now struggles with seeing his kids because he has problems with mobility which prevents him from doing regular everyday activities that we take for granted.

In closing, Cell phone use while driving has become the leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Driving with a cell phone could cause injury or death.

It has also been proven that an individual cannot successfully multitask while driving. Last, driving while using a cell phone harms others in ways that can permanently change their lives and affect the lives of their families.

Drivers should not be able to drive with phones because of the outcomes that could happen. A lot of drivers like to text and talk on the phone, but mostly text when they are at a red light or even text while they are in motion driving. Driving with phones in hands can cause accidents like crashing into another car, running off the road causing damage to the driver and any other passengers in the car if any and injuring other drivers on the road and even causing death upon yourself. Some people are addicted to their phones and want to be on their phone every time they get a chance.

Studies show that cell phones are usually the main causes of car accidents. Regardless of the crisis, people continue to use their phones while operating their vehicle because they want to always be accessible and keep in touch with other people. While some people aid using their phones while driving, there is documentation that they are dangerous and should avoid using them while behind the wheel.

Candidates whose work revolve around using a cellular device, like lawyers an businessmen, say that they always have to available to answer the phone to keep their organization in tact. Nonetheless, because of their customs, they can create alarming and life threatening situations like an accident or collision. Business issues can be stressful and hazardous while driving because it can cause affecting reactions that can lead to misfortune. With that being said, if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones, their routine can harm innocent people.

Some say that using a head-set while driving is a safer way to prevent people from getting into car accidents. Researches show that sing a headset can be dangerous as well as holding a cellular devices with your hand because the conversations still distract drivers from focusing on the road. People talking on the phone try to image the person that they are talking to. It is not that is interferes with their driving. It's more so the idea of the car swerving unexpectedly, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time.

Cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency, but people should not depend on cell phones fully because they are not always reliable.

Studies show that using a cell phone to read or send text messages delays driver's reaction time as much or more than the legal limit of alcohol consumption. Distracted driving has been called ""An epidemic in the U.S. that can be completely prevented"".

I completely agree with them because texting and driving didn't always used to be a problem. Now everybody thinks they can check Instagram or Snapchat while driving themselves or their friends to the park or movies, then they get into a car crash. It only takes three seconds after a driver's attention has been diverted from the road for a crash to occur. All they had to do was turn their phone off or put it in the glove box of the car, And the potentially fatal crash could have been avoided.

So if your one of the 77% of adults that think they can text and drive your wrong. Things can take a literal turn for the worse in less than three seconds.

And if your one of the 55% of teens that think that, just think you have your whole life ahead of you don't ruin it over a Snapchat post, or don't get one of your friends killed because you text and drive.

Texting is a problem with people especially with young people, they never look up so they might walk into a pole or something but when it comes to driving, not even the law can stop them from telling their friend that they are on I-85 30 minuets away and that accident usually doesn't look pretty.

People who are addicted to their phone and cant put it down shouldn't be allowed on any big roads unless they can put it down because accidents can happen in a second or two and a humans reaction time is 0.25 seconds which if you don't have your phone you can turn the wheel out of the way or hit the brakes but it takes you a second to put down your phone and half a second to look up and process what is happening and in total that's 1.50 seconds which means you lost your time to react and you have hit something or another car.

AEAD5B3E70D6,"Today, the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. Although it's embarrassing to say, we have grown quite dependent on our phones. Due to this I believe we should be able to use our phones in some form or capacity while in vehicles. There are a multitude of reasons one may need to use their phone while in a car.

One reason they should be able to use their phones while in the car is for navigation. Many people only use their phones for the gps feature. A lot of people have a poor sense of direction or don't know how to read maps. It's also useful if one gets lost and needs help getting out of that situation.

Another reason they should be able to use their phones is in case of emergencies. One might need to alert the authorities for some reason. It could be an accident on the road where the police are needed. There may be a fire in need of firefighters or something along those lines. There's no telling there might even be a need for animal protective services, these things happen.

Although phones shouldnt be used for a lot of things while in the car, this shouldnt expel them from being used in all forms in the car. Accidents may very well happen because of ""text and drivers"", so maybe they shouldn't text and drive. Completely banning cell phones though? That seems to be a stretch. Personally speaking I've lived in Georgia for two years and I still need the GPS to get around. Who has the time or patience to carry a map of georgia and pull it up to read it at every stop sign? The phones still can do alot of good while inside of vehicles. They can be used for emergencies. They can also be used for navigation. They even can just be used as a music player.

Before you decide to pick up a cellphone while you're operating a motor vehicle know the risks you're taking. Everyone in the car and in other vehicles are prone of getting hurt when a mind-altering device steers you away from the concentration you should have while driving. So many lives are taken or altered because of the simple decision to send or reply to one text message. If precautions are heavily enforced before adults and teens especially enter the car, then maybe this epidemic can become obsolete. Fines are enforced but how well is the question? Phones are the biggest distraction when you enter a car by far so this doesn't completely forget about alcohol or trying to change the radio station but technology has become so advanced that we have voice text and on a star. If the message is that important phones should become voice-activated and only respond to your voice so we can still pay attention to the road and send out a text without removing our hands from the wheel. Technology has also clutched us with Bluetooth if you need to stay in communication just use Bluetooth and make a phone call instead which is completely easier than sending a text anyway because its faster and you can get responses much quicker than you could with a text message. Reality is one text or call could wreck it all.

Ever since the emergence of cell phones, this generation has become heavily dependent on it for every minute of every day. Cell phones and texting were created ultimately to provide communication but it has now become so much more than that. The U.S. Government should ban texting while driving in all fifty states NO QUESTIONS ASKED! Visual distractions are a nuisance A visual distraction is anything that takes your eyes off the road. While driving we are constantly being side tracked by signs and advertisements we see all over the place from the newest restaurants opening, to the $100 billion Powerball billboards on the highway, the last thing you need to be doing is trying to reply to a text while paying attention to all of these catchy signs. And lastly, manual distractions which are any distractors causing you to take your hands off the wheel such as reaching for your phone to send that quick text.

Hmmm, should teenagers drive with cell phones? In my thoughts they shouldn't because more and more people are dying because teens and their cell phone use. People should really consider what they do before the do it. They might end up regretting it in the end.

One reason a teen shouldn't drive with phones is because they pay more attention to their phone than to the road. Over the past couple years 3,328 people were killed due to being distracted by their cell phone while driving. If teens just put their phone down and realize that life is more important than your phone, all of these deaths would decrease. I want people out there to think before they pick that phone up while driving. Is that phone call or text worth it?

Teens don't have much experience as an adult. Adult drivers are much more mature and advanced with driving. They could text and drive, but they have much more sense and consider the other drivers. Teens are quick to check their phones when they get a text. Use your brain for once and do not pick the phone up.

In conclusion, teens really shouldn't drive and text. You may think that you are very experienced at driving but you're not. Take the time out and think to yourself, ""Is my phone more important than your life or another person's life."" How would you feel if you killed somebody because you were texting and driving?                             ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

The use of phones has grown tremendously to the point that people feel as if they can't survive without them. It's bad to know that our phones are becoming more and more of our lives and that people can't take their attention off of them for minutes while they are on the road. I personally don't think people should be able to use phones while driving because it delays everything as in the way people drive how they are at stop lights and all of that. Many bad things have come from people driving and texting so I dont think it should happen that people can excess phones while driving.

There are many delays when people are on their phones. If they drive you can pretty much tell if they are on them because, it will show they will sit at the stop light longer even after the light turns green and they drive slower. You have to remember to when you are driving like this it puts others at risk of kids if they are playing and you don't see them because you are on the phone it will put them at danger if you do something. A lot of drivers that do this don't think of it as a risk because it benefits them but it truly is because, its putting every one in danger including them because their attention is altered and the person in front of them may make a sudden change.

I was looking at a document and it said that texting and driving is comparable to drinking under the influence if not worse and I could see that because when they are on the phone they swerve and slow down and their attention isn't on the road at all. People who are texting while driving are 23% more likely to crash their cars. This percentage is equivalent to that of the average person who has drunk four beers and then began to operate a car which is scary because, I am on the road pretty much everyday and to know that these people are out there too is terrible. If phones are worse than drinking I feel that it should be illegal to be on your phone while driving because, it is illegal to drink and drive so this should be too.

In conclusion, I don't agree with being on your phone while driving is right and it should be banned. A lot of bad outcomes can come from a person being on their phone. It's very sad to think about what could happen. People have kids and still drive with them for example my cousin does it and it's sad that she can put her selfish needs to the side for one minute to focus on the road so her and her baby can get to where they need to go safely. My mom always says I think about myself and others which is good because I always analyze everything for everyone and I want everyone to be good so if I need to get off my phone for a few mins for a safer drive I am fine with that.

Using a phone is dangers when driving. Someone can lose control of the car when driving. Someone can get hurt by using the phone while driving. Someone can lose site from the road because that person decided to use their phone. Using the phone can get that person stopped by the police.

When using a phone while driving can cause an accident. Someone can run over a person for using a phone. Someone can hit a car while using a phone while driving. Someone uses a phone while driving and runs a red light and hit a car. Someone can run a stop sign and hits a kid.

When driving and using a phone can get someone killed. Someone can fall off a cliff while driving and using a phone. Someone can flip over and lose their life while driving and using their phones. Someone can be going fast because they were using their phone and wasn't paying attention and hits a car and dies. Someone pays attention to their phone and runs over an animal and dies.

To conclude my essay driving while using a phone should not be allowed. Drivers should pay more attention on the road. Safe driver will not us a phone while driving. Reckless driver can cause an accident. People should not drive and text because someone can get hurt.        ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
48F9170156DB,"I personally do not agree with the usage of a cellular device while operating a motor vehicle. Although some believe that a cellular device is perfectly fine to use while driving, They are far from right. It has resulted in many fatalities all across the nation and is illegal in some states. Using a cellular device while driving is not only a risk for your own well being, but those around you as well.

If you're ever at a stop light and you look around, most likely somebody is on their phone. While driving you should have complete focus on the road at all times. A cellular device takes all of your focus off the road, now making you a distracted and therefore, a dangerous driver.

My Uncle used to operate his phone while driving, in result, one morning on his way to work, he was in a car accident. Thankfully nobody was hurt and the damage to his vehicle was reparable. You may think, that will never happen to me, well an accident can happen to anybody, any time, and anywhere. He could have seriously hurt himself or another person. Distracted driving is not a joke, and it should be taken seriously. When you get behind the wheel you are automatically putting your life along with the others in the car and on the road with you at risk. Do you want to be responsible for taking another person's life, another human being like your or me?

Let's say you have an accident while sending a text. The other person may have been hurt or perhaps killed. You are at fault. If the accident resulted in death, you're going to face jail time because that's considered manslaughter. If you just hit them, you're paying for their vehicle and medical bill, not to mention your insurance rate is going to skyrocket. Is all of that worth sending a quick text? Risking the lives of the men, women, and children around you and in your community?

Allowing yourself to be a distracted driver not only shows your disregard for others but also shows the lack of self control you posses with technology. I believe cell phones have become an addiction. Many people can't live without them and are constantly on them. Cell phones have become more and more convenient and connected to the world. It can sometimes be hard to accept the fact that it is not a necessity to have on at all times. There are plenty of excuses that people often use. But there is bluetooth in many newer model cars, and bluetooth headsets, which is still no excuse.

Some excuses may be, my mom is sick, I was checking on a family member, I was calling into work, etc... Many people take advantage of those so called,""excuses"". If you need to use the phone that badly, pull over and make the call. Don't risk the lives of others to call your best friend and tell her about your day. Being a distracted driver isn't okay and it isn't cool. Using a cell phone while driving is illegal in the state of Georgia, yet people do it anyways. Nothing is more important than your own life, or others. So as a result, I do believe that using a cellular device while operating a motor vehicle should be prohibited by law.

A013B75C0836,"Ever since the invention of the flip phone people have been texting and driving. This is an issue because well frankly it is dangerous. People who text and drive are more likely to cause a crash. Even if it is an emergency it still is not right to text and drive. In my opinion i do not think it is right to text and drive.

People should never be allowed to text while driving because it can cause crashes and even kill bystanders. When a person is going 50 mph and you look down at your phone your traveling 150 feet without control. In the state of Georgia you can get a ticket and a fine up to 25$ first time offender and 150$ for every other time you are ticketed plus one point against their driving record(1). If a person who was texting and driving causes a crash they could be charged with murder if the passenger or driver of another car is killed.

On the other side, during an emergency it is not right to send a text but it can be omitted in extreme situations. If you absolutely need to send a text but it is not an emergency, just pull over and send it. You could even get your passenger (if your with someone) to send it and save a life.

In conclusion, texting while driving is bad because you can kill others and ruin people's lives. When your in an emergency you should pull over and send it so you do not get a ticket. You can be fined or even put in jail for breaking this law.

Nowadays, it is estimated that around 5 billion people around the world own a mobile device. That is a huge amount of people but to every pro there is a con so, a major problem has come into light from all these phones. One out of four car accidents in the United States Alone is caused by texting and driving. Many people believe drivers should not use cell phones during the operation of a motor vehicle but in my opinion, it is a necessary evil to a certain extent and you should proceed at your own risk. Let me elaborate on how I came up on this assumption.

First of All, the x factor is phones have become such an important asset to our lives that most people got to stay connected some type of way. Whether you have to reply to a message from your best friend or you want to replay your favorite song, etc... Humans will always choose to pick up the phone no matter what. Laws and different measures have been taken throughout the world to stop people from picking up the phone but sadly, people still have accidents. Therefore, when laws and word of mouth does not stop this ""epidemic"", innovators step in and instead of trying to stop the act of using a phone during driving, they enhance the experience in a safer way.

Like I was stating above innovators step in, let me build on that statement. Many companies seen the safety hazard and they came up with their own solution. For example, most cars from 2007 & up come with a hands free feature. You connect your smartphone to the car through Bluetooth or a USB and you don't got to pick up the phone due to the fact you can do most of the activities that you do on the phone, on your car through a series of buttons and knobs, hence the name of the feature. In addition, many extra accessories have been created to help, not stop the use of smartphones but control it instead.

Lastly, no matter what the subject is whether its phones or something else, people are going to be people. What I mean by that is there will always be that # of people that just will not follow directions till an accident happens to them. I am a prime example of that, back then my dad would always tell me to put the phone down while I was driving, and I would be like ""yeah yeah"" sarcastically. Until finally one day I was driving home from school, and my favorite song played, so right after it ended I looked down for less than 10 seconds to replay it. Without noticing the car in front of me had stopped, I ended up rear ending her. It was nothing serious because I was going slow but still that little time I took to look at my phone could've cost me way more.

In my opinion, phones are an unavoidable problem nowadays. What I mean by that is yes they do cause accidents and they are a huge problem, but in this day and age almost everyone has a phone. Which makes the situation worsen due to the fact that we have become so accustomed to using our phones no matter the gravity of the situation.               ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

As times shift and humanity as a whole evolves it is evident that today in the present the vast majority of the population has some sort of possession and usage of cell phones . With that being said it should be noted that although cellphones are a crucial part of many individuals daily routine , there is a time where the safety of both drivers and pedestrians comes first .

Due to that reason along with plenty more ,drivers should not be allowed the usage of cellphones while operating any sort of vehicle as it poses a threat to the driver and their community as a whole .

The most important reason why cellphones should be prohibited while driving is because of the hazards it poses to drivers . Reports show that one in four automobile accidents are due to texting while driving that in the past year alone is estimated one million and six hundred thousand accidents due to cell phones. Adding to the importance of this subject teensafe. com states that on the daily there is, about 9 fatal crashes due to distracted driving

! All which could be prevented if individuals knew the prompt time to use their devices and if laws further enforced the hazards and prohibition of cellular devices while under the operation of a vehicle .

Not only does distracted driving create a danger to the driver but also the surroundings of the driver which can be detrimental . Experts compare the use of a phone while driving to drinking while driving because of the amount of time the drivers eyes are off the road ,this can further visualize the threat a distracted driver can pose to pedestrians and other drivers . When texting while driving you are far more likely to be in an accident , be at fault for an accident both to another driver or pedestrian , and cause damage to community infrastructure. Also in psychological studies it has been proven that the human brain is not capable of functionally multitasking that along with how driving could already be a danger it simply does not result in anything positive over a simple distraction which could wait, something life cannot do .

In conclusion , as distracted driving becomes more and more common the hazards should be emphasized far more and the act alone should be prohibited . No good comes from the use of a phone while driving as doing so not only is the driver at high risk but so is all of their surroundings which includes other drivers and pedestrians. Distracted driving or texting while driving is the number one preventable cause of death in america that alone explains how big of a problem the use of cellphones and driving has become .Moving forward it is crucial for drivers to be engaged on the road and to know when the prompt time to use their cellphones is as it can be a distraction which could wait ,something in which life cannot do . The safety and well being of yourself and others is far more important than anything a phone can provide, solely for that reason the use of cell phones should be prohibited while operating any sort of vehicle

Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image person who they talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack man oeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particularly time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of emergency. In conclusion, I think that mobile phones are indispensable tools that we cannot live without, but we should avoid abusing them.

And that you can test without having to stop looking at the road but those are all false advertising because you do. You must unlock your phone for you to be able to say the text just because we don't have to type it doesn't mean that is don't take our sight off the road. Some say it's wrong for you to text and drive and they are right it's wrong to do it because something can happen to us or more likely to someone else. It's easy for us to think that nothing can never happen to use if we text and drive at the same time, because it may have never happened to you but it doesn't mean that it hasn't happened to anyone else. Drivers should be more careful about what they do when they are driving it should not be legal to text and drive. No one should have to lose a family member for someone who was texting and driving and not being careful. Some want to get home to their families and can see them again.

Everyone has their own opinion and that fine, everyone has the rights. Texting and driving can cause your own life and someone's else for example A Fathers, mothers. Children's life.

When driving sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which make it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for exclusive use. Others drivers on the road take notice of drivers on there cell phones weather they want to or not because of the hazardo they create. Opponents who work depends on cell phones like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and risky situation or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reaction. Because of they conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car.

However, it is illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.

Americans have fallen in love with cell phones. They love the easy access of talking with loved ones, the taking of selfies at any time and the excitement of scrolling through and interacting with friends on social media. Cell phones have really made life for the American people a joyous and exciting occasion; until they get behind the wheel of a car. Loss of life, driving privileges taken away, and getting a ticket are all common problems that cell phones use when driving present.

Causing an accident and killing yourself or another person is a very real situation you can face when using the cell phone and driving. There is nothing wrong with talking all day and night to family and friends on the cell phone. The problems come when you decide to take the phone conversation into the vehicle while driving. One of the problems is distracted driving and taking your eyes off the road. Taking your eyes off the road is dangerous because in a split second you can have an accident and kill yourself or another person.

If you get into a serious accident, you may lose your privilege to drive your vehicle. The common behavior of texting and driving is similar to a person that has been drinking and decides to drive a vehicle. This behavior is dangerous, reckless, and an accident waiting to happen. Your eyes are supposed to be focused and alert on the road; not in your phone. If you recieve multiple tickets for driving while using your phone, there is a chance that your driving privileges could be taken away. To get back the privileges to drive again could cost a lot of money and time. Being able to drive is a privilege and losing that privilege is not worth losing due to a social media status update.

In the state of Georgia you are not allowed to text and drive, if you are caught texting while driving you will receive a ticket. People who text and drive are putting their lives and other people's lives at risk. In order to prevent the 1 out of 4 car accidents in the United States from texting and driving, there must be more laws put in place. We must continue pushing the hands free law to save more lives and help keep the roads safe.

As of today, getting a ticket, risking the loss of driving privileges, and even taking a chance of causing a death has not stopped drivers from using their phones while driving. It is exciting to take the perfect selfie and update your social media status on the go, however those are some of the things that should not be done while driving. Distractions from using cell phones while driving have become very dangerous and caused our roads to be unsafe. In order to drive you must follow the driving rules and understand that tragic events can be caused by using cell phones and driving at the same time.

When drives are distracted they can put their life in danger as well as other people in the car or other people on the road. Drivers should take that into consideration when they are on the roads driving. Drivers should be 100% focused on the road and not concerned about other things such as phones.

Most people can not focus while driving so it is very serious that drivers keep their eyes on the road. Texting and driving is like driving with your eyes clothes one little text can put your life in so much danger. Cars are made with bluetooth so that it lowers the chance of distracted drivers. Drivers should pay attention when they are driving such as drinking and driving. Kids are in the car with drivers when they don't know anything that goes on with drivers.

When you get caught on your by a police officer you can be fined and lose your license. When you lose your license you would have to go through a long process of getting them back. You can also get points taken off your license risking the chance of you doing things as far as traveling and police will be strict on you. You can save many lives just by paying attention to the road because others sometimes don't pay attention.

This texting and driving can be very serious and dangerous. Your family would be sad if something bad happened to you causing you to not make it home all because of a text. With bluetooth cars you can talk to the car a drive its called hands free. You can text people back on the steering wheels its options for that so that it lowers the risk of you taking your eyes off the road. Making it home feels like a big accomplishment to some people.

High Schoolers and younger kids should be required to take a class that teaches them more about the severity of texting and driving. Teens get cars and can't stay off their phones. They are more likely to be the ones to get in an accident. Teens could download a app while driving to preventing them from being on their phones while driving this app helps teens earn discounts on popular things that they want to purchase.

Although there's laws against it, people on the daily use their cellphones while driving. They'll check social media, text, call, and use its other functions. While it may seem like this doesn't uphold any problem or threat, this can be very distracting to not only the driver, but other drivers around them. However, some still think it's harmless, despite all the news stories and other tales of accidents while drivers were holding their cellphones.

One might argue that drivers using their cellphones aren't always dangerous, and that they most phones have voice command features and others like that which can allow the driver to use their phone without even touching it. And while this can be good way to use a phone while driving, the voice commands aren't always accurate and the driver might be tempted to fix any mistakes it makes before sending their message or going through with whatever they used the voice command for. In this case it makes using the voice command at all completely pointless. In other words, the phone would still be distracting to the driver.

Most of the people who use their phones while driving are usually of a younger age, such as their teen years or early twenties. Since younger people are usually around their phones more often, it's easier for them to become distracted more easily by it, and in turn they could cause a car accident which could harm not only them, but the other people around them. All of this could be avoided if certain laws were put in place to prevent people even touching their phones while driving.

While there can be ups and downs to having phones while driving, it's typically not a good idea. There have been countless tragedies related to cellphones while driving, most of which could have been prevented. It's one thing to have been holding a phone if it were a case of emergency, but that's usually not the case. People tend to disregard the safety laws regarding safety while driving, and it can be a danger to everyone involved, which is an issue that could be fixed by putting laws in place in order to keep drivers safe.

Should people be able to have their phones while operating a vehicle? In my opinion they shouldn't because it can probably cause an accident by the distraction. But only way I say it is okay is if you're using your phone for directions and your using a stand for it and not holding it in your hand or if your phone is hooked up with your car. Like if you have Bluetooth and you're taking directions from there or taking calls too. Some people needs to use their phones if they are lost or it's an emergence. Another reason you shouldn't because if you put your phone in the passenger seat and it rings and most people take their eye off the road to pick it up and that can cause an accident.

Most car accidents are because of distraction of phones like texting and driving, playing games on your phone or even video calling. People uses most of their time on their phone. Taking your eyes off the road can be so dangerous, even if you think it's a quick glace something can still happen. Just taking 5 seconds can be bad. It is very illegal to texts and drive or talking on the phone is. It is a total of 1.6 million of people getting in car crash over being on the phone. There is a big toll that it's mainly teenager who gets in car accident because of texting and driving.

Can you go to jail for this crime? Well it depends on what state you're in because some say it's just a fine and some say you do jail time. The fines are up to 20$ -500$ and it depends on what state you're in. Texting and driving can be a very serious crime because you're getting someone hurt for your actions. You can really injure someone and your consequences will be jail time because you can kill someone. Not only you're going to jail but you just took an innocent people lives. While your texting and driving not only your hitting someone in their car but you can run a red light and that person that is crossing you can kill them.

You can also hurt the people that you are driving with. For an example say you and your family were taking a road trip and you guys are on the highway and you look down at your phone for 5 seconds to answer a call or message that can be a big accident. Now you just hurt you whole family just because you wanted to answer a call or text, was that message was really important enough that you had to put everyone else in danger. Not just your family will be hurt but somebody else family would be too. This is why I say people should not be able to use their phones while operating on a car because it is so dangerous and can put someone else's lives in danger.

I think there pros and more cons in driving and using your Cell phone is unacceptable. But I'm in the side of not using your phone while driving. Because you're supposed to keep all your attention in driving and in the road all times. Texting and driving can kill in split seconds-just the amount of time it takes to send a quick text message. Cell phones cause many distractions, there are numerous amounts of risks while texting behind the wheel and it slows down your reaction time. Therefore its very dangerous using your phone and operating a vehicle be at the same time. Because anything can happen in any moment you can get in a harsh accident just by texting someone or just picking up or phone in general.

Cognitive distractors are anything that takes your mind off the road like engaging in a conversation via text or talking on the phone, or trying to operate your navigating system while route. And lastly, manual distractions which are any distractors causing you to take your hands off the wheel such as reaching for your phone to send that quick text.

If you are texting and driving it's not a good idea unless if it's something extremely important for an example like important call very important and you need to know what it is or an important text that is necessary to know. Simply because someone feels like they must respond to a text immediately is why many of the accidents occur and most of the time this lead to a vehicular accident that can result in death.

Teens to the ages 16 and 18 are using their phones and driving they are getting find by the police. The find cost about $500 to $800 just because they were texting and driving.

Drivers should not be able to use their phone and any device while operating a vehicle. The driver should be focused on the road and nothing else for that matter. Driving is a privilege for everyone and should be taken away if they take advantage of it. Cars were not invented until the late 19th century (1885 to be exact) People use to use a horse and buggy to get along or they would just walk. Now we have cars instead of the buggys. As stated before, it is a privilege.

Car accidents were not as bad as they are now. Back then, they did not have all of these distractions as we do now. Like the ones we have at our fingertips. Cell phones are really big now; everyone owns one and everyone uses them. With that distraction right by the driver at all times, it is going to be very tempting to pick it up and look at it. They made new laws that were passed a year ago about using a device while driving. It is called the hands free law. This law was passed in 14 states. Also, in 38 states they have banned the use of cellphones while driving.

Did you know ruffley 1.6 million crashes happen annually, queueing up to nearly 390,000 injuries each due by texting and driving. One out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. All due to the drivers using their cell phones while driving. It is not hard to drive and not touch or pick up your cell phones; just that habit we all picked up over time.

Driving can be safe again when the cell phones are put up. Driving with them on us is too much of a temptation for us. There needs to be a way to have a safer life. There should be a car designed for your phone. You put your phone in or on something and that way, it's out of your reach. Plus, it starts your car that way if you pick it up the car will come to a safe stop.

Eliminating the risk of the driver wrecking the car in doing so hurting themselves and or others.

That is one way to help with this cell phone driving problem.

In conclusion, there are many awful reasons that driving with a cellular device is bad. It can cause injuries and in some cases, death. It is a privilege to be driving and so for us to take advantage of it, it's not ok. And to put others and yourself in harm's way, it is not what you agree to when you take on the responsibility of driving.

6D0C595AD128,"Everyday people die or get injured in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone can put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid using them while driving.

Others whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep in touch with customers and clients. However, because of their habits, they can create very dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to death or injury. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can affect their driving ability that can lead to lose control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Many say that hands-free set is safety because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone imagine person who they're talking to and that doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrian step into traffic, and the mind lacks the power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time what may cause an accident because of lack of control, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call in case of an emergency. However, it lacks safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable. Also you won't be able to even use your phone if the emergency is severe so it defeats the whole reason to use the phone if it's a life or death situation.

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives.         ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

It is a well-known fact that the average person is not very coordinated or attentive. Along-side the fact that they are even more reckless with a phone in hand, so should they really be allowed to drive while actively using their phones. People should not be actively using their phone while driving.

First of all, it is known that humans cannot physically or mentally multitask. The most common thing people mistake multitasking for is repeatedly shifting focus on things, and that may work in any casual setting but in case of driving it can be fatal. With the average American highway speeds at 55MPH or 80.67 Feet per second, and according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration it takes four and a half seconds and another 144 feet to stop a car going at going at 50MPH assuming that the driver attentive to the road (""Safety in Numbers""). Going off of this, that is 1.5 secs reaction time (1.5sec x 80.67ft per sec = 121 feet) plus the 144 feet is takes to stop the actual car, and that come to a total 265 feet to stop a car going 55mph, with a driver who is not distracted by on the phone. With a phone a that only adds another additional 1 if being generous, which adds another 80.67 feet and brings the amount of road that it takes to stop a car to 345.67 feet. In which the additional 80 feet could have spared a life, but now has taken or seriously injured one.

Back on the topic a multitasking, the repeated shifting of attention from one thing to another. This shifting of attention is not even the full 100% attention. In the case of driving, no one never not wants 100% of their attention on the road while piloting a two-ton metal beast. According to the article Multitasking: Switching Cost by the American Psychology Association, ""although switch costs may be relatively small, sometimes just a few tenths of a second per switch, they can add up to large amounts when people switch repeatedly back and forth between tasks"". Going back to the previous paragraph, those couple feet in which a driver is not fully aware of the road around them is incredibly dangerous, and now adding other drivers also not fully aware, that's not a pretty sight.

Finally, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 3,450 people were killed from distracted driving in 2016 and 391,000 people were injured in motor accidents involving distracted drivers in 2015. All these deaths and injuries could have been easily prevented if the driver just put down their phones for a second and payed attention to the road. It is obvious at this point, that the people aren't meant to do more than one at a time, especially while operating a two ton metal beast.

There was a phone that was able to be carried anywhere, but it was large, thick, and heavy. Later technologists invented the new phone small, less heavy and just the right size for one's hand which is easy to carry everywhere and fit in a pocket. Before this new design, there was not a lot of phone use in cars and not so many accidents. Years later, the most popular phone is the iPhone by Apple. Many people buy phones because they use social media, Bluetooth, the internet, and other apps. Several people become distracted when they receive messages or notifications while driving because they pick up the phone to answer it. Using cell phones while driving should be banned to help decrease accidents, deaths, and legal consequences. Opponents of banning cell phone use while driving believes it is not the only distraction to drivers. What we should do is produce new technologies that make the practice safer for everyone.

I agree with cell phones being banned while driving. I can honestly say that I have almost run into someone's back on numerous occasions because I was focused on texting on my phone. I think driving while using cell phones should be banned because of the many car accidents that happen on a daily bases. The question is people more concerned more with their conveniences than they are with their safety or safety of others. It is a habit that spreads like the flu. Cell phones are the omnipresent electronic device of this era, and multitasking is the word of this generation so, it is quite natural to see many people with them. Studies have proved that drivers who use cell phones while driving are more prone to cause accidents. Driving while using a cell phone to drunk driving, in both cases, a person does not have enough focus and mentally capacity to carry out a potentially dangerous activity like driving. Banning cellphones while driving will keep a safe distance from accidents. One cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles if one keeps talking on the phone consistently while driving.

Another reason and perhaps a more tangible reason to ban the usage of cell phones while driving is to prevent car insurance from rising. In society, money is tight when it comes to doing different things with the way the economy is now. If you can, try being careful because the money you put towards careless accident that can be prevented can be put toward a light bill, etc.

The more the number of tickets you attract against your name, the higher the insurance will be. Driving requires a great amount of concentration, judgment, and precision when you are using a cell phone your concentration is greatly shifted from the road to the cell phone. When texting or calling a call they are not looking at the road they are looking at their cell phone within that split second you are putting your life and somebody else's life in danger. Many car accidents in the U.S are caused by texting while driving. If they ban cell phone usage while driving, they could save millions of lives, they will be more graduations rather than funerals.

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives.

People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc.

Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time.

Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving.

As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.

One such reason is that.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Scott Stone, veteran web business strategist and the owner of the consultancy Jimmy, says He came within inches of a bad accident because of a young driver being on the phone and crossing three lanes of traffic at 45 mph. Drivers are also tailgating you because of, again, the inability to maintain a constant speed because they are on the phone. Clark warns of the rusty red Camaro tailgating the minivan full of kids. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians. A young woman killed a pedestrian on a bicycle while she was texting on her phone. She may not have intended to end that person's life, but she made the poor decision to drive and text which she has to live with for the rest of her life. Any one of us could have been that poor individual on that fateful day. I used to ride my bike everywhere, mostly using the roads in the way that bikes are supposed to. That just proves that point that everybody 60 percent of teens admitted to risky driving. Nearly half of those drivers admitted to text messaging while driving. In April, 2009, in Houston Texas five children lost their lives when the car they were in lost control and slid into a rain swollen ditch. The driver lost control of the vehicle when he went to answer his ringing cell phone. The car went into the ditch and was swept 100 feet down the raging current. The rescue team was unable to reach the car with the trapped passenger. Two adults and one ten year old girl were able to escape, but five children under the age of seven all passed away. A 17 year old girl was driving in Jacksonville Florida. She said that she glanced down at her cell phone"" when she struck a 44 year old man. He was working on side of the road with his tree trimming crew when he was struck by the distracted driver.      ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

In 2018, 77% of the people in the United States own a smartphone. It is no secret that everyone is constantly checking their phone whether it be for games, music or social media. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates 660,000 drivers use their cell phones daily while behind the wheel. People are even willing to put their lives and/or the lives of others on the line all for a notification popping up on their screen. Using a phone while operating a vehicle should continue to be prohibited. It is a game of life and death to not only the driver, but the people around them as well.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or (NHTSA), classifies using a phone while driving as ""distracted driving."" In 2017 alone there were 3,166 fatalities related to distracted driving (NHTSA). Even if you're lucky to survive an accident due to distracted driving, there is still a risk of major injuries. According to teensafe. com, ""2.35 million people in the US are injured or disabled by car crashes every year. More than 330,000 of these crashes that cause severe injury are caused by texting and driving,"" (teensafe. com). This proves that phones have a key part in many accidents. They could've been typing a short response or reading a paragraph. The fact is that they were distracted instead of paying attention to the road. The NHTSA states, ""sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for 5 seconds. At 55 mph, that's like driving the length of an entire football field with your eyes closed,"" (NHTSA). In conclusion, by cancelling out the use of phones/electronic devices while driving, the risk of injury/death is greatly reduced.

While texting and driving can put you at risk of bodily harm, it can also cost you some jail time and put your wallet in harm's way. Anyone who has been in a car wreck knows how expensive it can be. Not to mention any medical bills, lawsuits, tickets/fines, etc. In Georgia just getting pulled over for texting and driving can cost you $150 and a point on your driver license (drivinglaws. org). Not to mention if you actually collide with another person and seriously injure them, you may face serious jail time. ""If you are texting while driving and you kill someone, you can expect to be charged with vehicular homicide or manslaughter with an aggravating factor. The crime can potentially carry a penalty as high as any other manslaughter charge that arises from a gross indifference to the safety of others. It could be as high as 20 years in some circumstances,"" (drivinglaws. org). The consequences are just not worth it. Keeping your attention on the road and the other people around you is the only thing you should worry about while driving. In conclusion, texting and driving accidents when they aren't fatal can still get you into a lot of trouble.

Although texting and driving puts you at risk of fines, jail time, or even DEATH, there are other alternatives; like the ""Hands-Free Driving"" that persuades people into buying phone stands for their cars. With the phone stand, the phone is either at eye-level below the rear view mirror or down to the side either on your left or right. By simply moving the phone to a different angle, people think that it's simply going to reduce the risk of texting and driving. The ""Old"" way of texting and driving was to have the phone in a position where your eyes weren't even near the road, but now the ""new and improved"" texting and driving now has your peripherals as your safeguard from motor accidents. The main issue with ""distracted driving"" specifically texting and driving was not that your hands not being on the wheel was causing accidents; it was that people's eyes were on their phone screen instead of the road. ""Hands-Free"" texting and driving only solves a minor part of a major problem. Before ""Hands-Free '' texting and driving was more of a sharpened skill because of the task of averting your hand(s) and eyes to type a message all without running into oncoming traffic or running into anyone else. In short, ""hands-free"" isn't a safe alternative to texting and driving.

The prohibition of ANYONE using a cellular device while driving, for ANYTHING, will reduce the risk of distracted driving accidents, and the consequences of said accidents, (fines/fees, jail time, and even the ultimate price, life). In conclusion, people should continue to not be allowed to use a phone while driving, so put that phone down and focus on the road ahead. Rather have them wait for a response and make it safe than never make it at all.         ",6,Phones and driving,Independent,1.0

When driving you should not use your phone, because texting while driving is against the law for a reason. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use has been the cause of 1.6 million crashes each year. The amount of injuries that come from texting while driving each year is nearly 390,000, according to the website ""https://www. edgarsnyder. com/car-accident/cause-of-accident/cell-phone/cell-phone-statistics. html"". Those deaths are from People who were using their phones while driving. However, if you haven't gotten into an accident yet, you could get other people in the car with you at risk.

While driving and texting is highly dangerous to yourself, it will endanger others either in the car, or around you. If you're driving especially with people in the car while texting, you are violating your safety and others in the vehicles around you.

20897B41AFB8,"While almost everyone owns and uses a mobile device, using them while behind the wheel of a vehicle should be prohibited.

While mobile devices are useful in everyday life, they are hazardous and in some cases deadly when a vehicle is involved. Devices cause distractions that can put not only the driver of the vehicle at risk but also those inside the vehicles, and the people all around the car. Distracted driving is one of the most dangerous types of driving and according to Edger Snyder & Associates, ""the use of cell phones while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes every year"" (Edgar Snyder & Associates ""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving""). The sheer amount of crashes involving the use of mobile devices is shocking, and this is one of the main reasons that the use of any kind of device should be not allowed while behind the wheel of a vehicle.

Although a crash may not seem that bad, some of these crashes result in many deaths and injuries. In a 2018 study from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, it states that distracted driving claims over 2,841 lives (Andrew. currin. ctr@dot. gov 2020). These numbers represent not only the drivers, but also include their passengers and any pedestrians who have died as a result of the negligence and recklessness of drivers distracted by mobile devices. The dangers that distracted drivers place not only themselves but also those around them is completely unnecessary. The dangers not only lie on the road but they also extend to after the crash takes place.

One of the other major issues that distracted drivers face is the financial costs incurred after the initial wreck. The people that suffer the most financial damage are the drivers, followed by their passengers, and then pedestrians involved in the accident. Some reason drivers suffer the most is because they are left paying for the damages to the cars and for personal injuries, not to mention their insurance premiums potentially increase. The passengers and pedestrians suffer because of bodily injuries and potential long term recuperation. While they likely do not have to pay for vehicle damages, if severe enough, injuries prevent them from performing their day to day activities and work functions, which may leave them unable to work and without money to survive. The law office of Tavss Fletcher states that ""the average cost for each death in a motor vehicle accident is $1,130,000"" and ""each nonfatal disabling injury is $61,600"" (""The Price Paid for Automobile Accidents and Injuries""). So the cost for the accident far outweighs the risk of texting or calling while they are driving, not to mention the potential risk of injury not only for themself but for everyone involved in the accident.

On top of the financial and physical pain these types of accidents cause, there is also the emotional pain of the victims and the victim's families. When a victim survives and they are injured, they can't immediately go back to work, school, or their normal lives. They need to go to physical rehabilitation which causes strain on everyone involved. Along with this, there are mental disorders that develop after the crash, one of which is depression. According to the Myers Law Firm ""Some physical injuries limit victims' ability to work, exercise, and enjoy day-to-day activities like playing with their children. If you're suddenly unable to partake in activities that you used to enjoy because of pain or a debilitating injury, it's no surprise you may become depressed"" (Myers Law Firm 2020). The victims may have difficulty adjusting to a new ""normal"" caused by injuries. These injuries may have caused a lack of mobility or body function, which hinders them from enjoying typical family or personal activities. Things they loved to do in the past that could be spontaneous or done in a few minutes now require extra time and planning to accomplish. Another mental illness that could develop is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD may make going back to their normal day to day lives very difficult. Often time people involved in wrecks will have flashbacks about it, sometimes triggered by being in a car, being near the wreck site or something completely unrelated. Not only is the physical and financial cost of such an accident steep, but the mental toll has a hefty cost.

Aside from the mental, physical, and financial sides of the argument there is also the legal side of it. Many states are starting to realize the dangers of distracted driving and are prohibiting it, and if anyone is caught they will either be fined or sentenced to serve in jail for a short time. One example of a state that has made using a mobile device while behind the wheel of a vehicle is Georgia. The hands-free law states that ""A driver cannot have a phone in their hand or use any part of their body to support their phone...A driver may not write, send or read any text messages, e-mails, social media or internet data content""(""Hands-Free Law""). The states understand that the use of mobile devices while operating a vehicle is dangerous, and they are starting to enforce that they need to get it under control.

The use of a mobile device should not be allowed while driving a vehicle. Some states are moving to make it illegal. The accidents cause high financial damage which supports the reasoning of the states to make it illegal. The many deaths, physical injuries and emotional strain that if inficts far outweighs any possible need for using a phone. The final reason that states are making it illegal to drive distracted is because of the high amount of crashes that it causes. It is because of all these factors that the use of mobile devices while behind the wheel of any vehicle should be completely and utterly prohibited.

People in the United States or anywhere should not be able to use their phones while driving. Texting and driving can cause an accident and can even cause someone to die. People who text and drive think it's safe to do because they look up and down, but it can be a matter of seconds and you hit a car or if in a intersection you hit someone walking. Don't text and drive

In the us there have thousands or even millions of accidents due to someone texting and driving or even talking on the phone and driving. People who do this not care about the life of others or don't even think that they are putting their self at risk. There has been times a car comes out totalled due to the fact that a driver wasn't paying attention to the road and causes a accident when all you need to do is pay attention to the road and nothing else. People that text and drive are ignorant people and are very dumb for doing this.

Phones should be put away in the glove compartment or keep somewhere out of reach because it can be very tempting to grab your phone to see if someone has texted you. When driving your number one priority is to be focused on the road and nothing else. When wanting to text do it at a red light that way you are putting people out of danger. When texting and driving if someone has to get on to you its because they don't feel safe, because you can swerve into their lane and hit them

Motorcyclist are the ones who really feel unsafe when someone is on their phone. One because you can swerve and hit them and end up killing them., second because you could injure them badly, and third they rage when someone is on there phone well depends on the person. Motorcyclist should be able to feel safe on the road and not unsafe and be able to drive on whatever lane they want. There have been thousands of motorcyclist who have either died or got injured badly due to a car hitting them due to them being on their phones or something else.

Driving requires a person to be very focused and every day we see drivers on the roads using their cell phones, and most of the time it ends in a tragedy. In some states it is illegal to let your cell phones touch any part of your body while you are driving, but many people seem to ignore this, some drivers' text while they are driving others may be on social media making posts of videos and photos and others may be talking on the phone. But it's not worth it because this distraction may cause a person to lose his or her life.

Anything can distract a driver and cause them to lose focus from the road. A number of road accidents are caused by people using cell phones we see this on the television and hear about these distracted accidents on the radio daily. There are many penalties if you are caught using a cell phone while driving in states or countries which have banned drivers from using phones while operating motor vehicles, you can be pulled over by police officer and be ticketed to pay fines this can also cause your insurance agency to raise the price of your monthly insurance.

As of July 1st 2018 the state of Georgia issued a hands free law where motor vehicle operators could not use their cell phones. The law states that ""drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or touching any parts of their body while driving.""

If you are caught in the state of Georgia driving and using a cell phone you may face a fine of fifty dollars and one point may be deducted from your drivers' license if you are caught a second time you may face a fine of one hundred dollars and two points will be deducted from your drivers' license, if you are caught a third time you will face a fine of one hundred and fifty dollars and additional points deducted.

Drivers are to just obey the road rules, if they do this we may have less fatal road accidents and so many lives will not be lost. With this people will no longer suffer due to reckless drivers on the roads.                ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Phone use and driving are two activities that should never be intertwined. Using a phone while driving is not acceptable. The level of distraction that comes from using a phone takes a driver's attention away from the road. A driver's attention should be focused on the roadway, not a phone screen. Cell phone use while operating a motor vehicle has led to a heartbreaking amount of people losing their lives and even more injuries. It is simply not safe and can lead to dangerous and heart wrenching moments. Cell phone use while driving needs to be banned nationwide. It will not cease to occur unless people see and hear the damage it can inflict.

When someone is using their phone while operating a motor vehicle, it takes a significant amount of attention away from the road, and onto the phone instead. Looking down at a cell phone for 5 sec while going just 55 mph means that you have just crossed the length of an entire football field without looking up at the road. The AAA Foundation For Traffic Safety ranked using a hands-free mobile device as a level 2 distraction and texting while operating a vehicle as a level 3 distraction, the highest level. Such distractions are unacceptable when operating a motor vehicle, it could lead to injuries or worse. A study conducted by Cambridge Mobile Telematics revealed that roughly 52% of drives that resulted in a crash were caused by distracted driving, and roughly eleven teens die per day as a result of texting and driving. Inexperienced drivers, such as teens, are more prone to engage in distracted driving, and are more likely to suffer a crash or accident when engaging in distracted driving. Having your attention focused on anything other than the road is a terrible and dangerous idea, and should not be tolerated under any circumstance.

Using a phone while driving, be it calling, texting, or anything else, can lead to horrible and heartbreaking injuries and even deaths. In 2016 alone, distracted driving took the lives of 3,450 drivers, and injured over 300,000 more. Using a phone while driving is a gamble with death. The CDC reports that nine people are killed and more than 1,000 people are injured daily as a result of distracted driving. Despite knowing these facts, many drivers still report that they engage in distracted driving, usually via phone. The individuals who choose not to use their phone while driving realize the consequences of distracted driving, and choose to seek the benefits of not using a phone while driving. Cell phone use while driving is a horrible practice. Sending a text is most certainly not worth a human life.

Using a phone while on the road is, as said, a dangerous practice, and must come to an end. The best way to prevent phone use on the road is legislation. New laws or stricter punishments on these laws would likely reduce the likelihood that people would choose to text or call while driving. There are ways to prevent phone use while driving that do not necessarily involve government. Making sure individuals, especially teens, know the risks behind using a phone while driving can persuade them to stop or not start. For teens, stricter penalties from parents would also dissuade them. Give instructions to new drivers to specifically not get on their phone while operating a motor vehicle.

Using a phone while driving, or being distracted by any piece of technology for that matter, is not acceptable. Lives have been lost, many have been injured, and vehicles have been totaled, all because of a call or text message. Laws must be put in place, and knowledge must be spread to end this practice. When driving, please put your phone down, and instead focus your attention to the task at hand.                                  ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Texting while driving is not good. Some people text their friends while driving and some people text for work on the road. Other people text while driving to save time.

More people have phones now and they are using them constantly. That means that texting while driving has also increased. Texting while driving should be against the law because it is causing more injuries and deaths than before cell phones were invented.

Texting while driving is dangerous. Texting while driving is one of the main causes of traffic accidents on the road. Studies have shown that cell phone texting is the cause of 1.6 million crashes every year, with 330,000 people injured in them ( tellrobert). There are probably thousands more accidents that are not reported because many drivers hide this information from the police. Injuries are not the only problem. Many people are dying because of texting while driving too. One study found that in 2016, 3,450 deaths were a result of texting while driving and is the leading preventable cause of death among teenagers now (Christopher ). The number of injuries and deaths alone is enough reason texting while driving should be against the law.

Surprisingly, there are still people out there texting and driving. These people believe that they are responsible enough to avoid wrecks and crashes (debate). Others think that since they are Americans they should be able to have the freedom to choose (debate). They think that they are above the rules . It is unfortunate that these people still text and drive when the consequences are so high.

Texting while driving has proven to be dangerous for everyone. The people who do it think they are bigger and better than other people. But why should their rights be more important than the rights of other people on the road? Shouldn't the other people on the road have the right to be protected, too? Is a text more important than a life?

The law was just passed last year that is you're on your phone while driving, that is an immediate ticket. Due to your criminal record (if it's bad) you can even do jail time if you feel you do not apply to this law. The cops of our cities are doing their job by stopping people who does not follow this law.

The main reason why this show not be condoned is, because most of these situations a citizen could get in a car accident. Approximately 1.6 million citizens die due to being on their cell phone while operating a vehicle. Nearly 390,000 people get real serious injuries due to texting and driving. One out of four of every car accident in the United States are due to texting and driving. In my opinion I believe texting and driving is the main reason we have so many deaths every year.

In conclusion, texting and driving needs to be/ stay illegal. That way people will not do it so often, which could decrease the death rate each year. Texting and driving could possibly be the reason why our death rates increase over time. Especially in this day and age, because almost everything now is technology based. In addition, I believe that texting and driving is not safe for yourself or others, so technology should be the last thing you are on while behind and active vehicle. Texts, calls, emails all can wait until you are in a secure place (not behind the wheel) to respond, and also that way nobody could die or have an injury                                          ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

The popularity of mobile devices has had some unintended and sometimes deadly consequences. An alarming number of traffic accidents are linked to driving while distracted, including use of mobile devices while driving, resulting in injury and loss of life. The most recent national statistics are sobering. 3,166 people were killed by distracted driving in 2017 alone, 8.5 percent of total fatalities for the year.

Approximately nine people are killed and more than 1,000 injured daily in the United States in incidents reported as involving a distracted driver. During daylight hours across America, approximately 481,000 drivers are using cell phones while driving. Teens were the largest age group reported as distracted at the time of fatal crashes. Texting while driving and other cell phone use while driving facts and statistics show that this multitasking behind the wheel is becoming a life-threatening norm. Talking or texting while driving or checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving.

While texting while driving certainly doesn't always lead to a fatality, there are a wealth of statistics that show that texting and driving is directly connected to traffic deaths. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use leads to 1.6 million crashes on a yearly basis while texting while driving is six times more likely to cause a crash than drunk driving is. One out of every four traffic crashes that occur in the U.S. are spurred by cell phone usage, and furthermore, each day, 11 teens die as a result of texting and driving, which is a downright astounding number. Over 3,000 teens and young drivers die yearly due to texting while driving.

Almost every state has laws strictly prohibiting texting while driving, and those who don't often consider it a distracted driving offense. States that once allowed texting while driving have since cracked down on distracted driving. Many states also prohibit talking on the phone while driving unless you are using a hands-free device. If you are a commercial driver, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) prohibits all commercial drivers from using hand-held mobile devices.

Distracted driving consists of driving while distracted in any manner. While cell phone use is often a part of it, distracted driving also encompasses many other activities, including eating, reading, drinking, talking to other passengers, looking around, adjusting location devices, adjusting the radio or any other activity that takes the driver's attention away from the task of driving. While any of these activities may be involved, texting while driving is usually considered the most serious type of distracted driving because it causes the most types of distraction.

A family decides to have a little fun on a Sunday afternoon so they all jump in the car and drive off to a shopping center. As the dad is driving he receives a text from his boss and decides to take a quick look at his phone to respond to his boss. As the dad was trying to make an innocent text, he was unaware that he ran a red light. Screams, screeches, and shatters is all that was heard as the family's car was hit by an eighteen wheeler. This scenario is a major example of what could happen if it was legal to use cell phones while operating a vehicle.

When using a phone while driving a person is visually, physically, and mentally distracted from the task at hand which is operating a motor vehicle. When making an executive decision to pick up a cell phone, both hands are not on the steering wheel.

The United States law states that unless someone is changing gears or putting on signals, they must have both of their hands on the steering wheel at all times .While looking at the phone, people are visually distracted which causes their eyes to be focused on whatever they are looking at and not on the road . The mind is officially concentrated on what is happening on the cell phone when it should be focused on driving safely.

Making decisions for other people by using cell phones while driving is selfish. Why cause problems and danger just to use a cell phone for a few minutes? Many people are risking other people's lives by not taking the responsible route when it comes to the appropriate time to engage in cell phone activity.

There are many ways to insure that a phone cannot be distracting while concentrating on driving. One of the many things that can be done is silencing the phone. This will decrease the level of distraction when someone texts or calls. Another thing is to try to keep the phone out of reach and keep both hands on the steering wheel. There are other things as well as apps that prevent you from using your phone while a car is in motion. These are all ways to make sure that a cellular device isn't the cause of an accident.

When having the privilege to drive, one of the many things people must be willing to do is drive safely by following the laws and rules set in place to help do that. The lack of obedience towards the law can cause serious harm to others. Driving while distracted by any mobile device can cause serious consequences for the driver and others on the road. Children, families, and loved ones could be affected by this simple act of insubordination. Many people in the world receive a call saying that their loved one died because they or someone else wasn't paying attention and got hit because they didn't look up in time to notice anything.

Driving is dangerous in general, but with a phone it is like playing Russian roulette with people who didn't ask to play. We should take the high road and put the phone down while driving and if something is that important than get to a safe place to use it.                  ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

A major problem in today's generation is using your phone and driving. Most of the problem comes from teenagers. Yes, I do think it is bad to use your phone while driving if you don't have to. Using your phone while driving is a really bad thing, it can get others killed or even yourself. Just think twice before using your phone behind the wheel.

Most states have made it illegal to use your phone while driving because it is really dangerous. While you are operating not just an automobile but any type of machine you must have all attention on that one thing nothing else . 100 percent of your attention should be with what you're doing at all times. Using your phone in any kind of way while driving can get you pulled over and even get a large fine.

One of the main things that drivers use their phone for is texting while they drive. That is probably the worst thing you could do while driving. Just think about it, you are taking your hands and eyes off the road and looking at your phone. Not only is that dangerous for you but you have to look out for others around you. Many people have died for using their phone while driving and died because of other people using their phone while driving.

The government has came out with a law that states that no matter the age you are not allowed to use your phone or have your phone in your hand while driving a car. A car is a dangerous thing and if you aren't careful with it then some really bad things can happen to other people or even yourself. If you get pulled over for being on your phone there is a 90% chance that you will get over a hundred dollar fine. So just ask yourself, is it really that hard to just drive?

In September, 2011 there was a texting and driving case. The driver was Rachel Gannon, a 16 year old girl from kansas city that was texting and driving. While Rachel was texting and driving illegally. Rachel Gannon got into a wreck with 72 year old Loretta Larimer. Loretta Larimer was killed in the car crash and Rachel Gannon was charged with manslaughter and assault. Rachel Gannon nw faces up to four years in prison for manslaughter and assault and she also has a 200 dollar fine for texting and driving.(2012)

Is texting and driving really worth killing yourself, killing others, wrecking, or paying a large fine? They should make some kind of technology that cuts your phone off while you are driving anything. If they did that it would cut down just about half of car wrecks and car deaths. Just stay off your phone while you are driving, it really isn't worth it.

There have been plenty of cases where the driver has just looked away for a split second then boom an accident has happened. That's why the ""Hands-free law"" came into place in July 1, 2018. As a driver your eyes should always be on the road , because it's for your safety and the others around you. Records indicate that there were 3,613,732 motor vehicle fatalities in the United States from 1899 to 2013. https://en. wikipedia. org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_fatality_rate_in_U.S._by_year.

The general population needs to understand that the Hands-free law is an important law to follow. Not just for your own good but for the others around you that has families that love them.

I'm pretty sure you would feel extremely regretful if you got into an accident , and it could've been avoided by just staying off your phone.

Driving & texting is also bad because let's say you don't have an accident , but a officer spots you first. Now you have a ticket on your record , and a fine that you have to pay. That's why it's best to purchase a car cradle so you can follow the law and avoid the law.

The Hands-free law is probably one of the best laws in georgia. Even though people still don't always follow the law. It still puts a strain on how often people were doing it.

For a very long time there has been approximately 660,000 drivers in the united states that use cell phones while driving. whether its taking a call, texting, sending emails, or even taking selfies. These drivers very often think that they are capable of multi-tasking with their phones and the road, but statistics have shown over the years people are only capable of doing so to a certain extent. Which is why its so easily avoidable to just not use your cell phone while driving to eliminate one reason of someone being fatally injured in or outside of your automobile. By ignoring the laws put in place to save everyone from being seriously injured due to such a small device , you are now putting everyone around you at risk.

According to ""Orlando health article by Benjamin Kaplan"" it states that ""one out of 20 drivers use a phone once they get into their car"" this makes you over 4 times more likely to get into a car accident. The article talks about how you're more likely to see teens in car accidents because of cell phones than adults now, this is because technology is made to grab the attention to teenagers, instead of putting their phones on do not disturb they rather risk their lives just to send a text.

There's many ways people can try and stop texting and driving and stop family and close family members from risking their lives like in some states have the ""no hands law"" where you can't have your phone in your hands which is a step forward to lowering car accident rates also in most places it's illegal to text and drive. Another good things phones have on them is a ""do not disturb"" app that makes sure your phone doesn't receive notifications, which will help with making you not check your phone because there isn't really a point. Also before you pick up your phone you should think about the lives you are risking (pedestrians, whoever you are in the car with and whoever you get into the accident with) is it really worth checking your phone if there's so many consequences?

Being on your phone while driving can lead to more outcomes than you may know. think about this, texting and diving then getting in a car accident will lead to insurance rates going up, may cause somebody to lose their life or cause permanent damage to your body.

Many teens today are getting distracted by their phones and causing accidents and majority of the teens that are in accidents are dying. Over half of the teenagers in the united states have admitted that they use their phones while driving. Teens that are distracted by their phone are also putting pedestrians in danger along with themselves. People also die every day because someone is not watching the road and is on their phone. They also think that the hands-free method is safe because they can use both of their hands but it's still not safe because people are still getting into wreaks.

Many teens are glued to their phone 24/7 and when they are driving, they still have their phone in their hand. Teens think that they need to have a phone in their hand and they think that if they don't have it in their hand they will die without it but if you are driving and on your phone you will die because you can get a really bad car accident. Teens nowadays are the main causes of car accidents because they are always on their phones talking to people and not putting their phones down while driving which is dangerous to other drivers on the road.

I know that other teens will disagree with me that they need to have their phone in their hand while driving just in case of an emergency but that's not a reason to have their phone in their hand.

Many teens also say that their parents need them to contact them if something bad happens to them while they are driving but if they are driving with their phone in their hand something bad will happen to them.

People should not use their phones while driving. People use their phones to text,answer phone calls,and to make plans. You can not do two things at once everybody uses their phones instead of paying attention to the road. You should always drive safe and make sure you stop at every traffic light. You should have drive at the speed limit. No car should ever go 100mph on the interstate or on a busy street. It will be hard to stop your car at a red light if you are going 100 mph. You will most likely get pulled over or get into a car accident if going that fast.

One reason you should not use your phone while driving is texting. One day you can be driving your car and you will get a text message from someone. That person will look at their phone and pick it up and start texting back. They will be all into their phone and not paying attention to the road. He or she will be trying to text back and pay attention to their phone and the road at the same time. They can be driving and slam on the brakes and the car behind them can hit them from behind and that caused an accident all because that person was trying to text someone back. You should not text and drive at all. That is so dangerous if you drive looking at your phone. Its alot of things that can happen when you are using your phone while driving vehicle. If you want to be on the phone with somebody while driving car you should get some where you can stick your phone in and talk to that person. You can also get pulled over by the police when using your phone while driving.

Picking up your phone to answer a phone call could also be dangerous. If you have to answer a phone call you should pull to the side of the road or wait to call that person back. Driving with your phone in you hand is dangerous because you will be busy trying to answer a phone call and not looking at the road. Your best option is to pull to the side of the road and answer the phone instead of driving with it in your hand. You can also get some earbuds to put in your ear so you won't have to answer the phone with your hand. Holding a phone or tablet in your hand while driving is so dangerous. You can have a phone is your hand but you will try to turn the steering wheel and you will not make a perfect turn. So it is best for you to not have no phone in your hand. If you are driving a car and somebody behind you on their phone. Both of you people will get to a traffic light and the light will be red and you and the person will slam on brakes and most likely you will hit another car and the car behind you will hit your car. It will be your fault that you were on your phone and not paying attention to the road. Then you will most likely go to jail if that person you hit die. Depending on how bad that person is hurting you can get like 5 years in jail probably more than that. Everybody in this world need to just stop texting and driving.

Some people use their phones and look up at the road at the same time that is dangerous to.

Nobody should make plans while driving a vehicle. Some people make plans while on the phone with someone or typing it in their notes so they won't forget. When making plans you should do that while you are at home. Making plans while driving a car can make you not focus on driving because you are trying to make plans. For example, you and a friend is in the car your friend is talking to you about going somewhere and you are trying to listen to what she is saying and focus on driving that is not safe at all. Your friend should wait until you stop somewhere to make plans. Talking while driving is not safe but you can talk and drive at the same time. When you are in the car with somebody you should just be focusing and not talking . When you in your car you should not play no loud music because you need to make sure you can hear surroundings. Like if you are in your car you might hear a police siren but your music is to loud so you wont be able to hear the siren. Say you are in the car with your friend and she try to show you a fight that happened at your school and you are driving a car you looking at the fight not paying attention to the road and you crash. It's your fault that you was looking at the phone and not paying attention to the road.

In conclusion,nobody should use their phone while driving. It is dangerous for you to text and drive. It is also illegal for you to use your phone while driving a vehicle. It's always safe for you to pull over to answer a phone if it is an emergency or to text someone back. No one should text and drive because that can ruin someone's life. All you have to do is pay attention to the road and you can be safe. Don't try to look at your phone and drive a car at the same time         ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Today, many adults or teenage drivers are hooked onto their phones. While driving, they can be prompted to use their phones for text messaging. It may cause many accidents, death, serious injuries and more. I honestly think that drivers should use phones while driving because they are taking risks that could kill or injure others and also yourself. There are also laws against using a phone while operating a moving vehicle but people still disobey them. I think that there should be more consequences when it comes down to texting and driving.

Using your cell phones causes many distractions. It only takes a blink of an eye to cause an accident. Yeah, resisting the urge to text while driving may be hard but it can and will save lives including yours. When driving, your eyes and mind are programmed to be focused on the road at all times. Having a cellphone on your person is a hazard in my opinion. Just think about it, anyone could be crossing a busy street. The person walking is probably expecting you to slow down and obey the street laws. Meanwhile, you're responding to a text that could have waited, now you hit that person and he lost his life. All because of your cell phone.

Texting and driving needs to be taken more seriously now. It is so easy for someone to lose their life over a message. If there is a law for it then you follow that law because there is a reason for it being in full effect. Just imagine you lost a close friend or family member due to breaking the same law you once broke. The death toll in Georgia of people losing their lives to texting and driving drivers is 3,166. That number has increased dramatically ever since 2017. We could do so much better and help decrease that number to at least zero to little deaths. That is unacceptable, literally no one wants to have news broken down to them on how their mom, sister, brother, etc has died in a texting and driving incident.

People have their phones on every day. They act as if they cannot live without their cell phone. I get you need your phone for business, social media, long distance calling or texting but that can wait. People should take in consideration of others and just make the roads safer than what they should be. No one is so busy that they need to hurry and send a last minute text or answer a last minute phone call. I believe that everyone has patience and that they should use it.

We have come to a society where phones are more important than our lives itself. That should never be the case, if anything I personally think cellphones should be banned while in a motorized vehicle. Choosing to value a text message over your own life is showing us you have no respect for yourself or for others. They should be more considerate and put phones down and make sure they are paying more attention to the road.         ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

People have their cell phones for about everything, e. g., Texting, speaking, schedule thinking, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we may still do two or furtherer of these feelings simultaneously. Alas, people are also selecting the wrong moment to take using their cell phones: While they are taking. As the country, We have grown therefore concentrated on how some we will do in once that we are prepared to seek our own safety, too as the safety of others because we can' 't put down our cell phones. Using the hand-held cellphone while driving is harmful to the driver themselves for a few good reasons. One much fact is the number of accidents caused by this type of technology.

Some states have created certain cases of cellphone usage prohibited for drivers while they are running motor vehicles. Some of these bans refer just to texting, and some bans refer to all handheld cellphone usage. Some people contend that all cellphone usage by drivers is harmful and that all usage by drivers should thus be censored. Should the government completely ban all cellphone usage for drivers while they are running motor vehicles? Could cut down on distracted driving, could decrease accidents, save lives, getting calls may take just as distracting as texting, And could send the message that no distractions are good while taking.

Is it really that important to keep the cellphone while taking it? Some drivers nowadays have their cell phones while driving and find it as a harmless act. Cell phones are today not just the form of communication, but also a distraction and harmful component. People believe that checking their phone while driving is only a fleeting activity and doesn't be, yet it may make less control the vehicle and less power to focus which leads to very serious consequences. Regardless of what period this driver is or how skilled they are, under no condition should they be using their cellphone while taking.

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

It is said that smartphones is a substantial and cause us to make very poor decisions.

All of us feel capable of being able to do two things at once but, using a phone while driving shouldn't be on that list. Using a calling phone while driving can decrease the driver's awareness on the road. Using it also can increase the driver's risk of causing a crash.

Furthermore, using a cellular device while driving can increase death rates.

Another big reason drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because it is legal! Under some state laws, serious repeat offenders may even face jail time. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, punishments such as suspending a driver's license may be implemented by police. Even though there are jail penalties you can also get fined.

Using cellular devices while driving is dangerous. Even if the split-second you look away from the road doesn't cause the accident, someone else could cause it by doing the same thing. Avoid the dangers, keep the roads safe, and wait until you get home or aren't driving to send or read a message. If you can't help yourself when your phone rings with a text alert, either shut it off or pull into a parking lot to check your messages. Nothing is worth your life or someone else's.

When people use cellphones, they look down while driving, and they aren't looking at the road, so they can bump into another car and hurt themselves .If they are going to use a phone they need a hand free one so they can just talk instead of holding it I feel like they shouldn't use phones at all because what if they get an emergency call and it upsets them or drive them crazy, they can get weak and crash and lose their life. You should look at the road at all times.

You can't handle a cellphone and a car at the same time, it's hard. Cell phones should get banned because of the amount of car accidents they cause. Imagine someone drunk and texting driving.

Being on cell phones have cost many people life changing injuries or even worse. While you are in the driver's seat you shouldn't even have your phone in sight. Don't put your phone on your lap or any place where it can be easily accessed. Just having your phone in arm reach would make you want to pick it up. When you are on the road you should give the road your full attention and do not look at your phone, you might think that it's okay to look at your phone for a second but that one second could make the difference of life or death.

Today, the majority of people own and operate cell phones and many of those people also drive on a daily basis. Drivers should keep their attention on the road to minimize distractions and avoid car accidents. With that being said, we know that cell phones have become very distracting because it occupies one's eye and takes their attention when what they should be focused on the road. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. This is not only causing a distraction for the driver but also endangering the lives of others around them at the same time. (5)

As a teenager, most of us feel that one of the best things we can ever do is get our driver's license. At the time all we're thinking about is ""Yes, I can finally drive."" We instantly get on our electronic devices and start taking pictures and sharing on social media so the whole world knows what we just accomplished. It hardly ever crosses our mind that in order to maintain having our driving privileges and showing our parents that we really can be responsible when they're not around, we need to remain focused on the road at all times. As I was doing my research, I came across a lawyer's website that said teen drivers are 4 times more likely than adults to get into car crashes or near-crashes when talking or texting on a cell phone. This was very alarming to me but I can easily see how that's possible. I feel strongly about this because anything you need to do on your electronic device, you can do before the vehicle starts. (7)

We know that people who drive and text are more likely to cause accidents that can hurt and or even kill other people. If you feel like it is that important to make a phone call or send a text, the best thing you can do is pull over to the side of the road and take care of it. The other option would be to link your phone to your car so that you can practice the hands-free options. This will include allowing you the ability to stream music, answer phone calls, asking for directions, and etc. You will also find that most cars have voice activated calling and some can even read your text messages through the car. All these are options are not the answer to the solution but they will give you a better chance to be a safer and more focused driver without having to take your eyes off the road. (6)

Modern cars are being built to be able to stop before any accident occurs. People shouldn't depend on their cars to stop because the functions can fail at any given time. Drivers need to be prepared on their own, when you took their driver's test you didn't have that option. If the safety feature works most of the times, it can help keep all drivers safe on the road. (4)

Being a part of the generation we are in allows us more opportunities because of our advanced technology. But this it is not always a good thing. Some phone companies can detect when a car isn't moving and will automatically send calls to voicemail or send text messages to let others know that person is unavailable at the moment. Cell phones should not in any way be utilized while driving because it's one of the easiest ways to jeopardizes one's life and their well-being. I think that technology will keep us safer but making good decisions will keep us safer. (4)

Over the past few years, cell phones have been upgrading thanks to the use of modern technology. Phones are like everyone necessity in living. Humans have the tendency to use their phones wherever they go, like making a call in the bathroom or checking their social media during a meeting or texting while driving the most well-known situation. Seems these devices always get the best of us making it a priority for us to check it because everyone seems to depend on them. Using cell phones while driving to text, place phone calls, or hand free-devices should be forbidden for the safety and protection of everyone on the road. Here are some causes as to why it is unacceptable to use a phone while driving.

Texting while driving has remained a tremendous influence on teenagers and young adults because of the use of technology has impacted this era strongly. When people hear their notification going off it triggers them to check their phone immediately on the spot. This causes accidents to occur because humans are too negligent to abide by the rule. If people can merely follow the law of the road and not examine their messages or attempt to respond until they make it to their destination with no accident occurring the rate of people dying in a car accident will reduce.

People believe that making phone calls is safer than texting. Well think again, people tend to get way into their conversation on the cellular phone that they don't concentrate on what doing causing things to go up in flames. For instance, cooking a meal for the family but suddenly receiving a call from a relative becoming too caught up after a long time, an hour pass the food starts to burn all because of a phone call imagine that happening on the road. But certain circumstances it can be understandable. For example, say that a loved one called for something that may be urgent or cannot be postponed then safely stop somewhere off the road to get out of harm way and answer it. These moments can be crucial to the life of another. So just wait for an appropriate time to use the cellular device.

Nevertheless, hands-free devices. These machines allow people to talk on the phone while maintaining control over the vehicle, however, it can still be risky. Inquiries have shown that chatting with someone on the telephone forces the cerebellum into using most of its strength into the conversation. This indicates that a limited amount of the brain's focus is direct attention on operating the car. This could also determine a discussion with someone in the vehicle is highly threatening, so if this were to be combined with a poor response, it must be cope with an awkward hands-free earpiece to wear which can be inconvenience due to the static or wind, its just a serious disturbance.

To sum up, phones and driving don't go well together. For it has caused too much unfortunate accidents and damage for us and can do more in the future. If the situation can't wait, you can always stop and look for a place to park so you can return the call or text. As for hands-free devices, they can be useful but just wait for the appropriate time to handle it, for it can be inconvenient at the time. Smartphones use should be taken to consideration for people have been abusing the use of this for too long. It may be as inaccessible, but if taken into thought the lives that would be saved this is a worthy sacrifice. There won't be a loss of nearly as numerous juvenile lives to talk or texts if they know their permission could be taken if they chose to continue this act.

Texting while driving is not a very smart thing to do, it puts you, the passengers, and others close to your proximity in danger or at least upping the odds for a car accident. About 1 in 4 car crashes are caused by texting and driving this means about 1.6 million car crashes a year caused by cell phones that's way too much in my opinion the laws that are being passed around this time about new phone laws while driving are 100 percent fine with me that will hopefully help the numbers decline a little bit.

Operating a vehicle requires your full attention to maximize the safety of you and your friends or loved ones. But also I slightly feel that at times it is okay to text and drive as long as you're not going over 15 miles an hour and is repeatedly looking up at the road while typing. It honestly just depends on the person behind the wheel, whether their good, bad, or smart about it. But in all reality I wouldn't text and drive be the smarter person and wait until you're at your destination or pull over if it's an emergency.

There's plenty of ways to counter you from being tempted to text and drive, on some phones you can set it automatically to while you're driving if you receive a text it automatically sends one back saying ""Can't talk now, driving.""

Everywhere you look there is always some on Instagram, Snapchat, or texting. Research proves that 76% of teens have died from car accidents. In many cases the teen was driving while texting on their phones. There has been an unnecessary use of money unfortunately for funerals due to car accidents that could've been avoided. My parents would always tell me the cellphone was the worse invention that was ever created. Although teenagers are crazy about their phones, texting while driving is too dangerous to do.

Admittedly, teens love their phones. We can't seem to exist without them. Teens connect with friends, family, and coworkers in this age of the computer. That's basically what the cell phone is now, a little but powerful, pocket-sized computer. Anything you want to know is just a click away.

However, texting while driving is just stupid. There have been several occasions where police have recovered cell phones after a car crash and the Snapchat application was open and the speed detector filter was active. The fastest speed ever recorded on the app was 121.2mph. There have been cases where people have died at only 10 mph. A lot of people text while they are stopped at a traffic light, but even then it is dangerous because you are not being wary of your surroundings.

In addition, teens act is if text messages or notifications are so important that it cannot wait until they arrive at their destination. Waiting to respond to a text, or just trying to impress your peers on Snapchat can save your life and or someone else's. In the year 2017 there were over 1,500 car accident fatalities in the state of Georgia. There has been a law passed in Georgia where if you are caught holding your phone while driving you will be pulled over and a $150.00 citation will be given. Being a resident of Georgia I feel this law has been helpful with car accidents due to texting and driving. Since this law has been passed the car accident rate in Georgia has decreased 10%.

In conclusion, there is no excuse to text and drive. One typing of a sentence can lead to serious injury and or casualties. The statistics speak for themselves. If it's important the person texting can call. That's faster than sending a message anyway and it just may save your life one day. So, put away the phone and keep your eyes on the road.

Say you check the road and get the clear to check your phone for just one minute, but you just sort of glimpsed to see if there was any cars coming and you missed a stop sign. You hit a car in front of you and seriously injure the other driver. Checking your phone for just one second while driving can cause a life changing accident to happen, so it's better to stay off the phone while driving.

You can accidentally take your own life or someone else's life just because you couldn't keep your eyes off your phone. If you harm someone because you were texting and driving, they could sue you and take a lot of money away. You can even end up in jail if the other person's injury is serious. Imagine having to talk to the victim's family and explain to them that you hurt their beloved family member because you had to send that text message.

A less serious result of using your phone while driving is being caught by an officer and having to show up at court to pay a fine of minimum twenty dollars if it's your first time but texting and driving tickets can go as high as four hundred dollars. Also you may get your license suspended for minimum of six months. Why not just put the phone down?

Texting and driving has many negative outcomes; some more serious than others but we can avoid bringing harm to others and to ourselves by just staying off the phones until it is safe to or until our cars are on park.

29F5392497DA,"Each day in the United States, approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1,000 injures in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. In the last decade primarily due to the impatient and fast-paced culture of today's social world, today texting and driving have grown tremendously. It can have detrimental effects on people and their families, but it is our job as the driver to control what we can, by not using any device while driving.

For starters, A cellphone in itself has drastically changed our society today. Everywhere we go we have to have our phones on us. In many reports like the Pew Research Center, it shows that 59 percent of the texting and driving come from Millenials. Many Millenials are captured on their phones while driving via Instagram. Although the majority of texting and driving comes from a younger age group, the older age group plays a part as well. Texting is considered a distraction and requires the driver to pay attention to the cell phone rather than driving many innocent people who have lost their lives from recklessness. Accidents are a result of people trying to respond "" right quick"" to whatever it is that may have popped up their device. They don't recognize that in a matter of seconds texting and driving can cause both them and another driver to crash and possibly lose their life.

As a result of many car accidents being caused by texting and driving Georgia put in place a hands-free law. The hands-free law makes it illegal for the driver to hold their phone while driving. Reading from a phone or using it to record videos is also banned in the state of Georgia. The law is not to harm those who are driving but to help them and others. After the law went into effect many people began to put their phones down and focus on the road. The rate of car accidents caused by texting and driving has gone down since the law first began to be enforced.

All in all, Texting and driving is a very big issue. Despite the hands-free law in place we still continue to do it and not realize how much we do or how addicted to it we are. A text isn't worth knowing that you can possibly be the reason another life ends. Everyone has the same responsibility to put the phone down while driving and give the road all of their attention.

How Texting and Driving can ruin a generation

Texting and driving is among one of the world's most deadly accidents for young drivers.

This has been occurring to individuals for over 20 years ever since cell phones have been Mainstreamed and publicised for people around the world. Now the most generic answer to this problem is to either ban cell phone, or to just leave your cell phone at home while driving. These problems do sound efficient at first, but when you dig deeper into how humans work with phones, it's really not. Humans have needs and wants, and sure with phones it's wanting to use it, but the way humans work leads to addiction problems.

Humans can have addictions to stuff such as drinking, gambling, and eating, but another addiction humans can get is texting. In a 2015 study published by Kelly M. Lister-Landman, she explains that people are compulsive to texting, even just looking at their phones to see if they got a message with no signs of one. This compulsivity can lead to them in the middle of driving to pick up their phone and check their snapchat. Now addiction relates to the topic because this is one of the problems for texting and driving. This can be a threat for some drivers who have texting addictions.

A question to this problem is should we let people use cell phones while operating a vehicle; the answer is complicated, and there are some reasons for both no and yes. The reasons we can't allow that is because we need our senses to operate on stuff. We use our sight on driving, if we can't take our sight off of driving, that would be like hammering a nail blind

Parker 3 folded. The way that most people see it, if you can't keep your eyes on the road all the time while driving, you shouldn't be allowed to drive period. Now this is where addiction comes into place. Having an addiction to your phone can be terrible for you while driving, so there should be help to people who have this. Now a reason phones should be allowed is for important phone calls or buisness calls. Say you on a business trip, and they need you to call them for explanation about what the trip is doing; you would need to use a cell phone for situations like this. Now like said before, the answer is complicated. People need to remember that there are both sides, and no matter what the answer will cause problems for society.

Not using your phone while driving can suck though, however, there are alternatives to it.

Say you just want to call your friends or family, you may still have your phone in your call, but don't look at it. Instead just wear a small one ear headset that way you can drive without taking your hands off the steering wheel. Another alternative is to have a phone with a voice assist installed on it, so that way you can say to text your friends. Everyone knows not using your phone for communicating with your peers can suck, but using these alternatives can help it less Suck.

After going over all of the solutions and problems, the best answer to it should be to allow people to text and drive but in moderation. You can't just in traffic pick up your phone and text your friends that the lady in front of you is slow, instead issue a more violent penalty if caught. Right now the fine for texting and driving is 25$ for your first fine, 50$ for your second fine, and 75$ for your third fine. This new penalty should be 50$ for your first fine, 100$ for your second fine, and for your third fine you should have your license revoked temporarily ( 2 weeks

- 1 month). Sure there will be objections to this solution, and they will probably have a better way of dealing with texting and driving, but know that there are more people that would be

It has always been a big concern on being on your phone, while driving. There are many bad outcomes from being on your phone while driving. You could possibly swerve off the road, crash into someone, or zoning out and not knowing what is going to happen next. Many people repeatedly still be on their phones while driving, while knowing what the outcome could lead to, and still not caring. Phones are a huge distraction while driving and no one seems to care what happens after.

Being on your phone while driving is not something that should be normalized. It can lead to one major problem, which is having an accident. When it comes to car crashes, and the cause of the crash is someone being distracted, is never a good look on the driver. Many people can lose their life, they can come out alive from the accident, but can still be traumatized to the point where they do not want, to ever get in a car again. 26% of most accidents are from texting while driving.

Another cause of being on the phone while driving, is a possibility of swerving off the road. No one ever wants to experience being a car alone, and next thing you know your trying to get back control of your car, from not being focused on the road. The outcome can be bad to the point where, you do not know where you are, may have lost your phone, and have no way of getting out because you are stuck. There have been nearly 390,00 accidents, caused from swerving while being on your phone. This could all be avoided if you just stay of your phone.

Finally, you could zone out, while on the road. When you are driving, your focus is the road. Zoning out while driving, and your phone can be a pretty ugly situation. You could possibly be intoxicated, and not knowing why, you on your phone and get carried away and zone out for a quick second, and next thing you know. You are in an accident. There are many ways to get an accident, but the common reason of accidents happening, is drivers being on their phone.

To sum up this unreasonable situation, do not be on your phone while driving. The outcomes can be you zoning out, which leads to an accident, swerving off the road, while being on the phone, and mainly just crashing into someone, while being on your phone. Whatever it is, it can wait, just for a good 10 minutes. It is never worth the risk of getting hurt.                  ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Although this topic is an on-going debate I do not believe that drivers should be able to use their cellular devices to a certain extent whie driving.

Also, people should be able to make urgent calls here is three reasons why i think people shouldnt be able to use their cellphones because you can cause traffic collision.

Drivers should not use cell phones because it distracts drivers and their attention should be on the road. There has been increased reliance on cell phones while driving and the issue has been debated over for a long time. This is because some deals and problems are solved instantaneously through making phone calls while driving.

The reason that cell phones should not be used is because it increases road accidents.

From the invention of automobiles, road mishap is always seen by everyone even dating back to times when cell phones had not been invented. With the correct view of the consequences of frequent accidents that are related to reckless driving, drinking, narrow roads and failure of vehicle engines, the prohibiting of the use of cell phone while driving is not an ideal action as it may lead to various unwanted consequences which may be expensive. The drivers who use their cell phones when driving are among the dangers on various highways. The drivers who use cell phones are more likely to be involved in road accidents than the non-users. In the process of talking to the phones, the drivers reduce their focus and their concentration on the things that are taking place in their immediate road environment reduces thus jeopardizing the safety of the pedestrians and the passengers in the vehicles.

When talking on the phone, it appears that a phone conversation takes precedence in attention over everything else, which can lead to accidents. This should overwhelmingly discourage the usage of cell phones while driving. These accidents can cause unnecessary injuries and even death.

In conclusion, cell phones should not be used while driving because it poses a serious threat to the safety of other drivers and their passengers. The consequences include the drain on health, financial stresses and injuries. People need to be aware of the risks of cell phones use while driving and encouraged to make safer choices through education.                   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
02BC8A1B2D2F,"You're on your way to school in your new car when you receive a text from a friend.""It will only be a few moments"" you think to yourself. You go to look through your phone and suddenly you've been charged with manslaughter. All it takes is a few moments where someone isn't watching the road for disaster to take place. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle due to the risk of damage, injury, and death that they not only put onto themselves, but others and society as a whole.

The consequences of damage driving not only include harm to yourself, but also others. In 2017 alone, 3,166 lives were claimed by distracted driving (Currin). That number includes not only the people at fault, but also innocent people who have had their hopes and dreams unfairly ripped away from them. The repercussions of distracted driving extend far beyond those who are responsible for causing an accident because of it.

Distracted driving can lead to damage of not only individuals, but also society in general.

A study by the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration states that distracted driving accounts for $129 billion, or 15 percent of the overall societal harm caused by motor vehicle (Anderson). That number implies that a massive amount of resources, productivity, and human life were completely lost at the hands of distracted driving; this number doesn't even account for what goes unreported. Society as a whole is damaged by distracted driving because of the immense loss of lives and productivity associated with it.

According to a recent study, cellphone bans are not effective in stopping accidents as a result of distracted driving. The study concluded that frequent cellphone users were more likely to participate in risky behaviour regardless if they were making use of a cell phone while driving (Morton). Later in the article, it is mentioned that regulation on cell phone use is reasonable as long as it is enforcement properly. Unsafe driving behaviour is reduced as a result and this could potentially save lives. Even if the impact of a cell phone ban would be small, it's still there, and that matters because those lives do matter.

The use of cellphones while driving could be the deciding factor of who lives and who dies. Though the impact of such a ban may be small, it's still there. Anyone could be a victim of distracted driving; this ranges from friends and family to complete strangers. Crashes as a result of distracted driving are an unfair punishment to those who are focused on the road and even people off of the road such as pedestrians. In conclusion, there should be a full on ban on cell phone use while driving.

EB763115B6CD,"Should drivers be allowed to use their phones while operating a vehicle?

Do you use your phone while driving? If you said yes, then you need to stop. If you don't then you may end up dead and if you don't believe me then let me tell you some facts. Here is why I don't think people should be able to use their phones while operating a vehicle.

Firstly, driving requires your full attention, but phones compromise this focus. You need to keep both hands on the steering wheel to be the most effective driver. But, every time you text, read messages or talk on a cell phone without a hands-free device, not only is your focus compromised, but you can't keep both hands on the wheel. Phone use when you are driving can also affect your alertness of the surroundings, which can make you prone to collisions. Also, distraction and inattention are the number one cause of traffic accidents and it is estimated that nearly every collision involves one of these two related errors. Driving takes all your attention and it is your responsibility to keep your eyes on the road, so put down the phones and pay attention to the road.

Secondly, people who use a cell phone in the car can drive erratically, which puts others at risk. They may fail to give the proper signals, miss road signs, change lanes abruptly or respond slowly to hazards. Erratic driving patterns can be extremely dangerous to everyone else on the road, including other drivers, pedestrians, and animals. Also, motorist involved in a stressful or emotional phone conversation may exhibit aggressive behavior while they drive, such as road rage. This may cause the erratic driving to worsen and this greatly increases the chance of causing an accident. So, if checking your phone is going to cause you to get mad and drive like you've got no sense and possibly kill someone, then there's no need in even picking it up.

Lastly, there are now legal ramifications when it comes to using phones while driving. You can have criminal penalties placed on you such as fines and tickets and depending on if you had an accident and killed someone you may face more serious criminal consequences such as jail time. Driving with a device can cause you to have higher insurance premiums because insurance rates are tied to a driver's driving history and if you get pulled over for using your phone while driving too many times, it could cause your insurance premiums to spike. Also, you can lose your driving privileges because just like your insurance, you accumulate points for your recklessness. So, if you accumulate too many, you can no longer drive. So, unless your like tickets, fines, jail time, or losing your driver's license, I suggest you wait till you get home to check you phone.

Well there you have it, everything wrong with using your phone while operating a vehicle. Hopefully, you all learned something from this. Hopefully, what you learned was that you shouldn't use your phone while driving. But, if you haven't, that's fine. Just ask yourself a question for me. Is everything you just read worth it for just a minute or two on your phone?                                                                                 ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

The Majority of people in this world, owns and operates a motor vehicle. Most people on this world drives them everywhere. But there are things that people need to learn how to keep in check before having the name ""pro driver"", and that would be a good attention span. People are too busy drawing their attention on phones! People drive while on the phone, texting, gets distracted from a notification and bam.. An accident occurs. There are hundreds of accidents, maybe even thousands, involving cars. While this debate rages on, Drivers should NOT use cellular devices in any form while driving as it can cause plenty of accidents,that can harm and kill lots of innocent people, leading to death, and it will cost you and the country a lot of money, IF you make it alive!

Using Cellphones at any capacity is a danger to society. It will most likely get you into a seriously bad accident. These accidents cause many people do get injured, or loose their life. Fatal car accidents that happen every 16 minutes. According to www. asirt. org, it says ""Over 37,000 people die in road crashes each year. An additional 2.35 million are injured or disabled"". This proves how many people a year get into car accidents, Millions a year, and that is unacceptable. The site also states ""Over 1,600 children under 15 years of age die each year.

Nearly 8,000 people are killed in crashes involving drivers ages 16-20"". This shows not only is it adults, its thousands of teens as well. We are talking about a generation that mostly cares about nothing but their phones, which explains why statistics show how teens attention span causes accidents more than a lot of other people.

Another reason while using a cellular device while driving, is that not only will it get you into an accident, it will have the country pay a lot of money for all 2 PLUS million of accidents that happens year. Some, may even come out of your own pockets if your insurance company refuses to pay and you lose a trial. According to branlawfirm. com ,""The U.S. pays about $230.6 billion in car accident costs annually - an average of $820 per U.S. citizen"". This proves that the U.S will be saving billions and billions of dollars if you eliminate all the car accidents that have happened over the years and could have used it for more other good causes. A site, Www. supermoney. com says ""I represented a family whose 9-year-old son was struck by a car. He spent a week in the hospital and racked up $100,000 in medical bills. The insurance company for the driver said the boy was 50% at fault, that he shouldn't have run out in the street. The police also blamed the kid."". This quote is accurate and to conclude this claim, this shows the fact that there's more than just having injuries and car insurance, it's also the medical bill you have to worry about because if you are at fault for being distracted on your phone you will end up paying a house worth of money for your medical care.

In Conclusion, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. The DIstraction causes plenty of accidents,that can harm and kill lots of innocent people, leading to death, and it will cost you and the country a lot of money. It cost the country over 200 billion dollars that they have to give up for all the car accidents, instead of doing what needs to be done for this country like saving global warming or enforcing gun laws, etc. The death rates in america is a lot cause by car accidents, and a lot of the people are teens whose attention is all on their phones. I would think twice about having a phone in the car as accidents and death involving cars is extremely predictable.   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Everyone including myself uses their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, social media, taking photos, etc. There are often times where we can multitask with all of the above. Unfortunately, most people are also choosing the wrong time to be on their phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on the little gadget in our hands that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't prioritize.

Despite of the many risk, people still use cell phones at bad times because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. There are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving. The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.

Although drivers should not be able to use their phones while driving, there are new devices that help multitask with driving and having your phone stationary. People say that hands-free sets are an example of practicing safety because people can drive using two hands and still have their phones in sight. However, hands-free devices don't eliminate the risk of causing an accident and it may even worsen the situation. Recommending such ideas could cause more controversy and promote unsafe activities by suggesting that the behavior is safe to the public. Researches show that using headsets such as bluetooth or ear buds can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distracts drivers from focusing on the road.

When we are driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for our exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. When driving, you have to be aware of your surroundings as well as everyone else's safety. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. No one wants to be apart of a traffic jam or worse, an accident.

Despite being addicted to these little hand held devices, we as a society have to learn to prioritize for the safety of our nation. The hand free devices are fine but Studies show that they do not prevent a high number of accidents. The amount of focus and time spent on being cautious and aware is not high in numbers. Drivers are too in tune with what is going on with the rest of the world that they can not seem to focus on the road ahead. Once everyone understands the importance of not texting and driving, the streets will be safe for us as well as the upcoming generations.

Now that everyone has a cell phone, usage while driving is common. People are multitasking ang doing all sorts of work things, like calling, emailing, and texting while driving. I do not believe that cell phones should be used while driving in any capacity. I believe this because safety and focus are extremely important and there are enough distractions without adding any more.

Cars can be very dangerous. It's very important to be safe always. At any given time throughout the day, approximately 660,000 are attempting to use phones while behind the wheel of a vehicle. Phones have connected us at all times. But that can cause serious safety risks if someone decides to check his or her text messages, emails, phone calls, or any other mobile applications while driving.

Distracted driving is one of the fastest growing safety issues. According to the (NHTSA), 3,477 people were killed and estimated 391,000 people were injured on U.S. roadways in 2015 because of distracted drivers. Distracted driving is doing another activity while driving. This takes driver's attention away from the primary task of driving and increases the risks of crashing. Common distractions are not limited to talking on a cell phone, texting, reading, eating, grooming, using a navigation device, and turning the radio.

The presence of a passengers and animals can also increase crash risk. Georgia law requires drivers to care in driving a vehicle and prohibits any action that distracts the driver from the safe operation of such vehicle. Georgia has a new Hands-Free Law that mandates that drivers are not allowed to hold or support a phone for any reason. A phone can only be used with headphones, a wireless device, phone holder or mounted device. Penalties are fines and points added to your driving record that increase for each conviction.

All drivers regardless of age are prohibited from reading, writing, or sending a text message while driving. This ban applies to any texting while driving. Exceptions are provided for emergency personnel, drivers responding to emergencies, and drivers who are fully parked. A conviction for either violation will result in the accumulation of one point on driving record. Texting while driving is illegal and can result in death.

Many people use their phones while they are driving. Almost 390,000 injuries occur each month due to distracted drivers. People should not be allowed to text and drive! Because it puts others in physical danger. We can stop this from happening by having the laws against phones more heavily enforced and discourage cell phone usage by producing a Bluetooth software to use hands-free across every device.

Furthermore, individuals who disobey the law and keep using their device on the road should have to pay a fine for putting other drivers in danger. If the problem is still occurring after the fine, they should get to face jail time or pay the fine with an added $100. The final step in stopping phone users behind the wheel is that they should lose their license for a year. Hopefully, this will be an efficient way to stop distracted drivers from losing their focus on the road by using their devices.

Also, phone companies should be directed to add safe driving features to help keep the public safe, which will in turn bring down the death rates from people using their phones and driving. Companies should encourage safe driving by making a system that makes answering calls and replying to text messages with your voice to minimize the loss of concentration due to the loss of focus on the road. It would be beneficial to make hands-free devices mandatory before they go to the market.

All in all, stopping phone usage on the road is beneficial. Creating hands-free phones by all phone companies should be a safety demand required by the law. The number of offenses on the new law should be up to 5 offenses each month. When you are in trouble for using your phone while driving by the law with an offense, you should loose your drivers license for up to a month along with additional taxes to teach you a lesson. If these actions are carried out properly, up to 421,000 road incidents related to distracted drivers could be prevented each year.        ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

97% of teens agree that texting while driving is dangerous, yet 43% do it anyway. In my opinion, I am glad Georgia passed the law where you cannot operate your cellphone at all while driving. It will most likely stop wrecks from happening as much and will make the passengers feel safer knowing that the person driving won't be distracted by whatever texts and twitter messages that pop up on your phone.

It is a known fact that while you are operating a cellular device that your mind is focused on whatever your looking at on your phone, and not focused on what is going on around you in the car. Even using hands-free is against the law and the first time you get caught using your phone while in the driver seat results in a $50 fine and one demerit point. They both serve the same purpose when it comes to distracting the driver. Now there are some exceptions such as reporting traffic accidents, medical emergencies, and criminal activity, but you have to have proof if you want your case dropped. These rules might sound crazy but its finally time we took a stand and did something about people using cellphones while in the driver's seat.

Being someone who struggles with anxiety, sitting in the passenger seat while someone is using their phone while driving can be really nerve-wrecking. It's like wow is whatever you have going on in your phone really more important than my life? I don't think so. The passenger should control the driver's music, phone calls, and any other reason they are on their phone, it's really not that hard. It is proven that you cannot focus fully on the road or on other vehicles around you while talking on the phone.

Some studies say that driving while using your phone can be just as dangerous as driving while intoxicated. Which makes sense because your mind is not focused while in these states of mind. Cell phones are amazing devices that are useful in life, but threatens the passenger and other peoples lives. I wish people weren't so inconsiderate and thought about the consequences these actions had on not just them, but everyone around them. It isn't worth it!

Whatever it is on your phone that you're dying to look at, can wait until the car ride is over. No text or phone call can be that important to take your own life or someone else's, and if so let someone else in the car handle it. All in all, I think it was a great idea to ban cell phones while in the driver seat because it is making it safer for everyone on the road and ourselves. It may be frustrating to not be able to look at your phone, just think you're saving a life by doing so.

5B20D8C3781D,"Today, around the world, there are concerns that many individuals abuse the use of cell phones while driving a vehicle. Using a cell phone, while driving a vehicle, is dangerous to the user and puts others at risk of unnecessary accidents or death. The use of a cellular device, while driving, increases the risk of a car accident and decreases the driver's focus on the road. The abuse of cell phone usage, while driving in horrible weather conditions may also increase the risk of injury or death. Drivers should not use mobile phones while driving because it could lead to distraction which increases cognitive delays in the brain. Several emerging concerns of cell phone abuse, while driving, includes: texting or speaking to another individual, an increase in vehicular accidents, and a disruption of brain activity which results in a decrease of concentration.

Texting or speaking on a mobile phone while driving is distracting to a driver of a vehicle. These types of distractions may cause drivers to lose focus of the road or their surroundings which can ultimately endanger the driver and others. Talking to people, while operating a vehicle increases one's distraction. Conversations, by mobile phone, while driving, can be emotionally charged which only decreases awareness on the road, its rules and other drivers on the road. Cell phone distraction rates, due to texting or speaking while driving, are at an all-time high. Taking one's eye off the road or removing a hand off the steering wheel significantly increases the chance of an unnecessary car accident. It is not only the responsibility of the driver with a cell phone, but the individual on the other end of the conversation, to be respectful of the need for a driver to have complete focus while driving. At one time, cell phones did not exist, so it is imperative that conversations between people are held before or after a person is no longer operating a vehicle. There are state laws which have recently passed that impose fines, upon individuals, for cell phone abuse, such as texting while driving.

Accidents can be caused by individuals using their cellphones while driving. Car accidents and human deaths, due to cell phone abuse while driving, have unfortunately increased in the United States. Today, nearly everyone uses a cell phone where people check their social media, read or send text messages and/or make calls. Unfortunately, many people try to use their phones while driving which cause car accidents. Car accidents can ultimately lead to unnecessary injury or death of innocent bystanders. In addition to driving under the influence, the use of cell phones while driving increases accidents the world over.

A disruption within the human brain causes an individual to lose concentration or focus while driving. For example, driving a vehicle and talking to someone on the phone cannot be given the same amount of equal attention at the same time. For example, if the brain, of a driver, is focusing on a conversation on the phone, he or she may not notice the red light because he or she is looking at the phone versus straight ahead. It is virtually impossible for an individual mentally focus one hundred percent on more than one thing at a time. People cannot multitask where there is optimal focus and effectiveness. The brain handles tasks sequentially, switching from one task to another. Yet, the brain is incapable of juggling focus or attention simultaneously. .

The abuse of cell phones, while driving, is detrimental to oneself and others due to the contributing factors of texting, holding phone conversations, vehicular accidents and loss of focus due to limits within the human brain. There is only about a three second reaction time between a potential car crash and a driver being distracted by his or her cell phone. Texting or holding a conversation on a mobile device, while driving, is arguably just as dangerous as driving under the influence of alcohol or other substances. In many states, throughout North America, it has been made illegal to write, send, or read a text-based communication while operating a vehicle. Today, current vehicles install bluetooth in order to increase the use of hands free cell phone use, and in hopes of decreasing unnecessary vehicular accidents.

Have you ever been on the road and almost got into a wreck? Majority of the time these accidents are caused by negligent drivers. These individuals tend to ignore the rules of the road, and operate their motor vehicles while on their mobile devices which results in 1 out of every 4 accidents. Is a text message, or the next level of Candy Crush more important than your well-being, and the welfare of others.

In many cases accidents are caused by distracted drivers. As the National Safety Council has reported, phone usage on the road can lead to 1.6 million or more accidents a year. This leads to a total of 390,000 or more injuries and deaths a year. This is a fairly large number and the problem needs to be dealt with.

Due to these shocking statistics on distracted driving, a law or regulations must be put into place to prevent these tragedies. For instance, the government could implement having fining to any individuals caught with their mobile devices in hand. However, in most cases this won't stop an individual from doing what they want. So what I propose is a two strike law. This would implement at first heavy fining. However if the individual continues to cause problems, it may result in the permanent suspension of their license. The question now is; What happens to the individuals who cause deaths do to their negligence? Simple, They will be fined and imprisoned for vehicular manslaughter.

You may be wondering why my views on this subject are so harsh? It is quite simple; I have been in an accident due to distracted drivers. When I was young riding around with my mother, a distracted driver rear-ended us, taking off the bumper. The shocking part is, if my mother had slowed down even a little, I would not be here to express my concerns. I believe that all people should strive for safety when it comes to driving. As many wise elders say, ""It is not the road you must fear, but the other drivers.""

Finally, I wish to express how distracted driving could be permanently purged from the world. Due to the increasing advances in technology, companies could begin to create self-driving cars. This will eliminate any potential risk of distracted driving, due to the fact, the individual is not driving. However, with the people who may not have the means to purchase such a vehicle, I recommend either purchasing a taxi such as an Uber or Lyft. The real productive way to stop all distracted driving would be to simply put down the phone while driving, and if it is a serious emergency pull to the side of the road where you are no longer a danger to yourself or others.

EC6294806131,"Cell Phones and Driving: A Potentially Fatal Combination

Cell phones are a staple in many people's lives today. It is a convenient and straightforward way to communicate with someone, gain knowledge, and directly search for information and use for different types of entertainment and media. Everywhere you go, you can see a phone on someone's person, and sometimes even on the road. This single action of holding a phone in your hand on the road has a heated debate going on around it. Should this be permitted or not? Let's look at the statistics-- The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA 2019) reported 3,166 deaths that occurred in 2017 due to visually distracted driving. That makes up 8.5% of the total fatalities that year (FCC 2019). While this is still less than ten percent, we can make that number a lot lower and spare hundreds of lives each year. These deaths are avoidable.

The utilization of cell phones in a vehicle while operating should be prohibited in all states by legislation, nationally. Such prohibition includes messaging and all media; however, navigation programs on the phone could have several legal compromises and adjustments.

As mentioned previously, 8.5% of the annual fatalities in 2017 were caused by distracted driving. In addition to this information, The CDC states, ""Each day in the United States, approximately nine people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver."" (CDC). This is a massive amount of injuries each that could be easily avoided and possibly save many lives. Edgar Snyder and Associates, a personal injury law firm, publishes that ""Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving"" in the nation and 21 percent of teenagers behind the wheel that died in crashes were diverted by phones (Edgar Snyder and Associates). Texting is while driving is the most hazardous activity that can be done while operating a vehicle. ""Texting can make vehicle accidents 23 times more likely to happen."" (Helbock 2018). Looking at a phone while typing a message impairs the visual, cognitive, and manual abilities needed to efficiently and safely drive a car. While sending or replying to a text, a person is no longer only thinking about the road, but also taking in information and visuals on the phone. They are distracted from lights, signs, signals from other cars, and the entire road overall. Additionally, both hands are not on the steering wheel, weakening their control and regulation of the vehicle.

All of these disturbances, individually and combined, are exceedingly dangerous. When a person that is driving is using a mobile device, it not only imperils their own life but also the lives of passengers that may be in the vehicle with them, pedestrians, and other road users such as motorists and cyclists. In these kinds of accidents, many are either killed, injured, and many are frequently left disabled in various ways. However, phone use for travel navigation is a complex debate distinct from texting.

Numerous drivers use navigation applications installed on their phones and acknowledge that they are more efficient than the ones that may come in the system within their vehicles. However, not all are using them safely- having their phones in their lap, or next to them in a cupholder while looking at directions. They do this while also trying to pay attention to the road, but this is no better than not paying attention to the road entirely. Even if a person is not typing, the dilemma yet lies in not having eyes on the road. Looking down even for a few seconds to follow the navigation route is extremely dangerous. To this problem, the solutions are phone stands added with audio navigation guides. A sturdy phone stand should be fixed to the front windshield of the car from the inside a touch lower than eye level, so a person can still see the road ahead and their directions. In addition to this, an audio guide can play to direct them with ease while still having a visual guide at their convenience that will have a significantly lesser probability of inducing a fatal accident.

The best ways to prevent these accidents are with laws and education. Teaching young adults early in school is essential to have them remember the lessons later in life. The education system should take charge of incorporating lessons on road safety and phone use each year of a student's educational career to help them recognize the danger they could put themselves in when driving and looking at a phone in their hands. The earlier they start, the more educated they would be, and the less likely they would be to make the wrong decision later in life. After a student has graduated, strict road laws on phones and driving should be a regular reminder of their education, and not to put themselves and other people at risk. Legislation should be passed in every state regarding phone use in the car and make it reach out to citizens effectively. This would significantly reduce the number of vehicle fatalities each year.

While cell phones are utilized everywhere throughout our everyday lives, people should not use them while operating a vehicle. Various statistics show that this is an extremely practice that claims a multitude of lives every day, yet people continue to do so. Through education and legislation, the fatal numbers could be reduced, and citizens would be more educated on road laws and safety for themselves, including those around them, and make the streets safer for everyone. It is time to take this data more seriously and prohibit cell phone use on the roads.

Although laws have been put into place to try and prevent the usage of a cellphone when driving, sadly, there are still people who don't feel the need to abide by these rules. Which is why the punishments for breaking such laws should be highly enforced and more drastic. Examples of this would be increasing fines, harsher warnings, or longer time served in jail. When people driving are distracted by their cellphone, they are not only putting their life in danger, but also everybody`s around them. In the United States, one out of every four car accidents are caused by texting while driving. Something needs to be done.

If you look down to check a text message and have averted your eyes for 5 seconds while driving 60 miles per hours, you have already traveled the length of a football field. Anything could happen within those 5 seconds. While you were looking at a picture of a dog that your friend sent you, you ran a stop sign resulting in another car driving full speed to crash into you. In this scenario, two cars are destroyed, and the people inside have forever mental and physical trauma and that's only if they didn't pass due to the impact of the collision. It is very important that people know what they are getting themselves into when being a distracted driver.

Depending on what state you live in, the punishments put into place when someone is seen texting while driving is to give them a fine, criminal charges (usually misdemeanor), and/or jail time. There are 48 states who have banned texting and driving. A handful of states` average fine amount is around $150 to $375. Although it can range from $20 to $10,000. A 90-day license suspension is also put into place whenever a person repeats this doing. Georgia`s hands-free law not only prohibits the use of texting while driving, but also reading emails, recording videos, and taking selfies. Please consider the consequences before responding to your friend while driving.

One way to prevent getting tempted to use your cellphone while driving is turning your phone off before you turn your car on. This eliminates the possibility of even getting a tempting notification in the first place. You can also put your phone out of sight/reach. If a situation ever does come up where you have to respond immediately, you could pass your phone to whoever is riding passenger, or you could pull into a parking lot and wait until your vehicle has come to a complete stop before responding. By knowing how to avoid being a distracted driver and putting your practice into play on the streets, you're not only making your life safer but everyone`s around you.

Overall, texting while driving is a highly dangerous task that doesn't just affect your life. When you are driving, you must be considerate and mindful to everyone else on the road. Being a distracted driver doesn't just show that you are selfish, but also that you have no courtesy for fellow drivers. As long as we enforce the consequences put upon people who text while driving, the road will be a much safer place. Whether it's because people don't want to pay a pricey fine, or because they follow precautions to prevent being a distracted driver. In reading this essay, I hope you now know why it is so important for you to drive safely.       ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Watch out! Phones used when driving should not be allowed under any circumstances.

While driving, one should have their eyes focused on the road not on ones phone. In fact, using a cell phone while driving can cause many distractions and it can be dangerous as well. People should not be allowed to have cellphones while driving because it causes needless accidents.

To begin with, cellphones allow drivers to get distracted. For example, most of the time, most drivers are bored when driving, so many tend to text or call friends or family while driving. Doing so, would cause cellphone users to cause accidents that do not need to happen and thus, putting others in danger.

In addition, studies have proved that drunk driving and driving while using a cellphone have similar effects. The common denominator in both of these instances is that the reaction time of the driver decreases when distracted or impaired.

Even though talking on a cellphone may be less distracting than other activities, eating while driving, it is still considered dangerous and life-threatening.

Finally, acknowledging that even minor distractions can affect ones ability to drive and cause disastrous consequences . Not using a cellphone while driving could prevent a serious accident, which is one reason we shouldn't let people have their phones.

Moreover, distractions can also be quite dangerous. It is important to know that the one time the smallest of distractions to cause an accident.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Many teenagers have their phones as their top priority. Many of them are on them all the time even while driving. Texting while driving is one of many causes of death in the United States. These young 16 year olds don't understand that not only are they putting their life in danger but they are putting the person beside them, in front of them, and behind them in danger. With that being said phones should not be aloud to be operated by a human in any sort of way while driving.

Teenagers do not understand the meaning of putting your phone down. If so many teenagers would just pay attention to what's going on around them they would understand what's going on in the world. As a teenager i feel as so that if Georgia passed a law on hands free driving there should be more cops out. Cops are not paying attention to any of the drivers on the road. There is probably more people on the road texting while driving than speeding.

More people die from texting while driving than actually getting into a harmful wreck not involving a phone. Teenagers and even adults could care less about the people around them on the road and that is not how it should be.

People should be careful while driving because driving is what everyone does and even if one person is on there phone while driving when there driving next to just think about how much damage that could cause in just a quick second.

If more teenagers and adults cared about the people who are around them on the road than wrecks like this would not happen. You would not be hearing about tragic deaths on the news caused by distracted driving. If you realize it, there are more teenagers out on the road getting killed because of phones more than adults. I'm pretty sure adults got the hint when they realized that they were putting not only their lives but other people's lives in harm's way.

Phones while driving can wait. You only get to live your life once and so do the people around you. Don't think that looking at your phone for one second won't change anything because it could change everything. You can look at your phone when you get home or when your parked in a parking lot.

Did you know that car crash fatalities are the number one cause for teen deaths in the United States? In fact, according to TeenSafe. com, 11 teens die as a result of texting and driving each day. Distracted driving has now been universally labeled as an epidemic in America and a large quantity of distracted driving incidents stem from cell phone use. Cell Phones should not be eligible for use when handling a street motor vehicle.

When people use cell phones, all of their focus is not directed toward driving.

Whilst listening to music or conversations (like from a podcast or a call), drivers dedicated focus on the road decreases by 40%. This is a major reason as to why cell phone use leads to 1.6 million wrecks a year. Without being allowed to use cell phones while driving would make it so everyone is solely focused on driving and uses their full brain capacity to reduce the risk of crashes.

Even without constant use of a cellular device whilst driving, it still has a hindrance on people's ability to view the road. Our brains instinctively respond to the alerts our phones send us, making it nearly impossible to resist the temptation to do so. Aceable. com says that you are 1.4x as likely to crash when just simply reaching for your phone and 23x the risk when texting, which is 6 times the risk of when under the influence. If we can't handle not reaching for our phones, then it needs to be banned similarly to alcohol.

Alcohol is made so that you are not allowed to travel with open containers. Cell Phones should be completely off and tucked away somewhere for you to retrieve them for when you are finished traveling. Your phone should not be on your person if you are controlling a vehicle to avoid the temptation. If you decide not to turn your phone off, you must pull over safely and steadily when you wish to answer a call that may be of importance. Following these rules would drastically decrease both the risk of getting into wrecks and the number of annual fatalities that come from distracted driving.

I understand sometimes it could be an emergency but still at the same time, that's why you just turn your emergency lights on.

It's an increased risk of crashing. While driving your usage might be banned so you won't be able to use your phone while driving.

Please drivers keep your eyes on the road and off the phones. Like for example you can last 30 minutes without being on the phone. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. It's extremely dangerous in horrified accidents.

Everyone wants to be free and safe and not have to go through court and the hospital.

Teens are only supposed to be on the devices a certain amount of time and this goes for teens and adult that drive.

This is important because phones also distract us from driving now. This very dangerous, and we should pay more attention to our surroundings. This is because driving with our phones can cause us to have a wreck, cause harm to others, and get in trouble with the police.

To start with, having a phone as a distraction can cause you to have a wreck while driving. Your eyes should be focused on the road at all times. If you take your eyes of the road for a split second there is a chance you are not paying attention to what is in front of you. Chances are if you are looking at your phone you could end up on the other side of the road and could possibly hit a car. You could also run into the back of somebody else's car in front of you.

Next, you could cause harm to others or yourself. If you are speeding while driving the impact could be very harmful to you and someone else as well. If you are on the other side of the road while being distracted by your phone you could have a head on collision and the impact could be very powerful. Having a wreck by not driving safety and being on your phone could raise the price of your car insurance. You could also have damage from your air bag.

Finally, you could get in trouble with the police. If you are driving reckless passing by a police they are going to notice. This could get you a ticket or possibly cause you to go to jail.

If you are on your phone and get pulled over, you could possibly get a fine. It is a law that you cannot be on your phone while driving or even have it in your lap.

The ability to use our phones while driving has always been a problem involving many accidents, laws, and fines to be paid. Phones shouldn't be allowed to be used while driving for many relevant reasons. It's important for drivers to not be blinded by their phones, that would lead to a terrible situation.

First of all, it can cause a car accident to happen and, in some cases, even worse. When using a phone while driving, it doesn't let you pay attention towards the road you're driving on.

This includes the driver having eyes on his phone and that moment that the person is paying attention to their phone, they may not stop in time if something or someone were to pass by them in front of their car. These types of accidents happen often because of drivers using their phones while driving.

Second of all, phones are considered illegal in some states which can cause a ticket or fine to be paid for. Even if the state says it's legal, you can get more of a bigger pay fine if the driver were to violate any other law and proven that the person was using a phone. The fine or ticket can be a bigger punishment for those using a phone while driving in most cases that involve accidents. More legal actions can occur from using a phone while operating a phone as well.

Third of all, Phones while driving is a high leading cause of death. These cases where car accidents happen, could not only end up in a hospital bed. Most cases that occur with the driver being distracted by their phone involves more fatal collisions. When you become unaware of your surroundings for those seconds spent on your phone while driving, it allows for only the worst car accidents to happen, therefore leading to the cause of death.

In conclusion, being able to use a phone while driving should be prohibited. Throughout my reasonings it is clear to see that phones have been a problem involving many drivers.

Overall, the ability to operate a phone while driving will lead to accidents, fines to be paid and even death.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Many people text while driving or call while driving. Snap chat is the most used app by teens while driving, mainly to show off that they are in their new car, or to show that they are out somewhere. Some talk while driving holding the phone up to their ear driving with one hand on the phone and one on the wheel. Others face time still driving with one hand holding the phone to their face and the other one the wheel. Some text while driving with one hand on the phone and the other on the wheel. Others use the hands free were people can just talk into the phone, and tell the phone what to send in text. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving.

One reason why people should not use cell phones while driving is they could get in a car crash. ""The national safety council reported that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year,"" (Edgar Snyder & Associates). People using their cell phones while driving have one hand on the wheel, and one on the phone causing less control of the wheel. Also some people crash their car due to looking at their phone trying to text, call, or take a picture or video of themselves. Driving and using a cell phone could be dangerous and can lead someone into a car crash.

Another reason why people should not use cell phones while driving is they could get pulled over by the police for the use of texting driving. This will cause the driver to get their license suspended, or lose it. ""Nearly 390,000injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving,"" (Edgar Snyder & Associates). Police try to pull people over before there can be a possibility of an accident happening. People think that police are being too strict when they pull people over for texting and driving, but they just want to help people out before it is no other person in the world to save.

On the other hand, others may go against, and say that Drivers should be able to text and drive. For example if people learn how to text and drive there will be less accidents. In that learning process people can crash the car from being too cautious do to slamming on the breaks trying to stop. Learning how to text and drive is more dangerous than getting stuck at the top of a rollercoaster. Therefore, people should not text a drive ever.

Cell phones should not be at use while driving ever. More people are being killed by it, and others are losing their licenses from it. Texting and driving is not worth losing someone's life, or worth going to jail over. Texting and driving is a big danger and can lead to many bad out comes at the end.

If used correctly, driving with moderate phone use could be very helpful. GPS is the only thing that keeps the current generation on track. Of course, with all distractions that occur while driving, phone use can be detrimental, but without these devices, driving would be completely different.

GPS is an amazingly useful tool. Many people find the option to have exact directions quite comforting, or even speaking to someone can kill some anxiety when driving. Going from one point to another has never been. Before this beautiful inventions called GPS, one would have to use an atlas or general directions, but now with the internet slowly becoming more and more essential, most GPS maps come with features such as a speed limit sign, just in case you missed one on the street or highway you're on. Not only that, but out is the day of calling to get traffic and accident information. Now is the day of real time information, quick rerouting and even small shortcuts not known by most.

This ties in with the anxiety of driving in general. The constant fear of missing an exit, getting in a car wreck, and not making it on time. Speaking with someone, keeping a conversation, or even music played from the phone itself can ease that stress and make life much easier for the driver. Music has always been a universal way to calm one's self. Speaking to someone either about your anxiety or holding a civil conversation is also a very good way to calm down and focus easier and overall be more safe.

Many advocates for the way things used to be will say that any use of the phone should be prohibited, that any use at all can cause a wreck. I completely agree, if used incorrectly, cell phones can be detrimental to whoever is on the road with you, but one thing some of these advocates don't think about is the amount of people who are safer due to their phone. Some insurance companies have apps which track and adjust rates based on the person's driving. If it weren't for GPS, many people would miss exits, swerve to get in their lane, and in general make dumb mistakes which could lead to more harm than good.

In all, I believe texting, using social media, and constant use is bad for the driver, drivers around them. If you find the correct and safe way to use these devices while driving your vehicle, I do not see it fit to completely ban or prohibit the use of these everyday tools. Correct use is not life and death, correct use is making the time you have on this Earth easier. If you wish to be an advocate, look into what you're advocating for.

Many people use their phones while they are driving. About 390,000 injuries happen each month due to someone distracted by their phone. Using a phone while driving is dangerous, and it needs to stop. Two ways that we can stop this are having the laws against phones and driving more heavily enforced and developing a hands-free software for all phones.

Even though there are already laws against using your phone while driving, they should be more heavily enforced. Law breakers should have to pay a fine for putting other drivers' lives in danger. If it is still done after they are fined, they should face jail time. For the third offence, they should lose their licenses. That will be an effective way to stop some drivers from losing their attention to the road by using their phones.

More hands-free software should be added to phones. The hands-free software should be mandatory to have on every phone. They should have it where you can answer calls and reply to text messages with your voice to minimize concentration loss from the road. It would be a great idea to make it mandatory to add a hands-free software to each phone before they go on the market shelves.

In conclusion, ways to stop phones and driving are having the laws against phones and driving more heavily enforced and developing a hands-free software for all phones. If these actions are carried out proficiently, up to 421,000 incidents related to phones and driving could be prevented each year.

243C93B97E8E,"Ever since cell phones were introduced to the United States Market in the 1980's, their usage has grown tremendously over the years. One main reason is that they facilitate communication between people, with a cell phone you could reach a person from virtually anywhere. Unfortunately, people decide to use their cell phones at the wrong place and time, while driving. Driving while using cell phones and/or cell phone gadgets distracts the driver and greatly increases the chances of an accident. The use of a cell phone is also illegal in many states and it comes with consequence. If a person is behind the wheel they should not be able to use their cell phones as they are putting many lives in danger.

Cell phone use while driving distracts the driver from keeping their full attention on the road, therefore, greatly increasing the chance of an accident. There are three types of distraction: visual, manual, and cognitive. Visual distraction requires taking your eyes off the road, manual distraction means taking your hands off the wheel, and lastly, cognitive distraction is when you take your mind off driving. Texting while driving is highly dangerous because it combines all three types of distraction. If the person behind the wheel is entirely distracted from the road, they are a danger to themselves, the passengers in the car, and everyone else on the road. Every second a person spends looking at their phone while driving they travel another 25 meters without paying attention. Research from 2019 has shown that drivers use their phones for up to 3.5 minutes per hour when driving (Texting and Driving Statistics in America). This means that drivers are traveling a considerable amount of distance while not paying attention to the road, which could result in a motor vehicle crash.

In 2018, 4,637 people died in car crashes due to cell phone/electronic device use. These crashes were responsible for $129 billion of the overall societal damage caused by motor vehicle crashes. Many states in the US have noticed the increase in cell phone related car accidents, so not only is it dangerous to use electronic devices while driving, it is also illegal. On July 1, 2018, the state of Georgia enacted a law called the Hands-Free Law. The law states that drivers cannot have a phone in their hand or touching any part of their body while talking on their phone while driving (GA Highway Safety). It even mentions hands-free technology, stating that even with gadgets that do not require the use of hands, drivers cannot write, read or send text messages, e-mails, social media content and other internet data while on the road. Besides the consequences for breaking the Hands-Free law are monetary fines and points assessed against the driver's license.

Each day in the United States, approximately 9 people are killed and more than 1000 injured in car crashes that are reported to involve a distracted driver (CDC Motor Vehicle Safety). This suggests that phone use while driving is almost as dangerous as driving drunk, although studies show that texting while driving is 6 times more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk (Texting and Driving Accident Statistics). The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that every day 660,000 drivers use electronic devices while behind the wheel, but 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving (2017

Cell Phone and Driving Statistics). This implies that although many drivers are using their devices while driving, they know it is wrong.

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones and/or cell phone gadgets while behind the wheel. Statistics show that while doing so, the probability of being involved in a motor vehicle accident increases greatly. Even federal law supports the ban on cell phone use while driving as many states have enacted laws against it.

You can communicate with people, listen to music, watch tv, and a lot of other things. There is no question about why cellphones are this popular. Some would say they are too popular. Cellphones have been the cause to many vehicle accidents. People text and drive, or just do things on their phone while behind the wheel and next thing you know, their car is in a ditch.

There have been laws passed in some states that outlaw the use of cell phones while driving. While I don't completely agree with the full banning of phones while driving, I do understand why they did it. Being on your phone while driving is a huge safety risk to you, anyone in your vehicle, and also anyone on the road with you. It isn't fair for others to be at risk because one individual can't wait to respond to a text or check a notification.

I think there should be some kind of phone lock that is incorporated into each device which basically only gives limited access while moving in vehicles.

In these times, phones are a huge distraction while on the road of driving. A Georgia law was made that drivers are to have a phone holder while driving in the vehicle, but there is still a large abundance of deaths in due to car accidents. According to research conducted at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any drawbacks. In my opinion, I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers, it is illegal, it increases the number of deaths per year, and because it's a myth of multitasking while driving.

One reason I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it increases the number of deaths per year. For example, cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts show that this behavior is common and dangerous for teen drivers. Distracted driving is dangerous, and cell phone use while driving is a major factor. In 2018 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was involved in 2,841 motor vehicle crash fatalities. Among those killed: 1,730 drivers, 605 passengers, 400 pedestrians and 77 bicyclists. Knowing cell phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts may help people manage a dangerous crash risk. Though texting and driving caused many injuries and deaths, there are still people who don't think it's a problem and are confident that they can use their phone and drive simultaneously. However, 34% of teens aged sixteen to seventeen spend about 10% of their driving time outside of their lane. This affects other people who are driving and can cause the deaths of innocent lives.

Another reason I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it is inconsiderate of other drivers. The consciousness of events happening around vehicle has a huge impact on driving. It is necessary for the drivers to monitor outside events and their possible impacts on driving. Using cell phones make it difficult to keep an eye on the outside events. Negligent behavior is highly immoral and unethical as it exposes human lives to a huge threat of accidents that could ultimately lead even to death. Now, a new study indicates that damn near everybody uses their phone while behind the wheel, damn near all the time. Using sensor data from more than 3 million drivers and 5.6 billion miles of trips, driving analytics company Zendrive found drivers are using their phones on 88 percent of their journeys. The average driver spends 3.5 minutes on the phone per hour trip, a stat that sounds worse when you realize just a two-second distraction increases your risk of crashing by 20 percent.

The last reason I believe that phones should not be allowed of use during driving because it's a myth of multitasking while driving. Multitasking is valued in today's culture, and our drive for increased productivity makes it tempting to use cell phones while behind the wheel. People often think they are effectively accomplishing two tasks at the same time. And yes, they may complete a phone conversation while they drive and arrive at their destination without incident, thus accomplishing two tasks during the same time frame.

Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving."" Drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones while driving because it creates a distraction that could not only lead to injury to the person on their phone but also other innocent drivers on the road. Even the most experienced drivers can find themselves losing control of the wheel while concentrating on their phones. Also driving is a task that requires constant awareness, any type of diversion can lead to accidents no matter how quick it is. In a lot of cases death and serious injury is the result of ""glancing"" at your phone even for two seconds. In reality no text, call, video, etc is worth losing a life over.

Additionally the mortality rate behind using cellphones while driving has caused some states to take legal action. 19 states have banned hand-held cell phone usage while diving, 39 states bans any cell phone usage for novice drivers, 20 states bans any cell phone usage for school buses and 48 states have banned texting while driving. So not only is cell phone usage while driving dangerous but also illegal. So if you are using a cellphone you risk getting into an accident and getting into trouble with the law, which could possibly require jail time or a fine. Also this can affect your insurance, constant tickets and fines from texting while driving can make your insurance go up almost two times its original cost.

According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause car accidents. Studies show that using a cell phone can make you 4x more likely to crash. Despite the dangers, people still use their cell phones while driving to communicate or occupy themselves. Some may argue that using hands-free features is safe, but research shows it can be just as dangerous as holding the phone because the conversation can distract drivers from the road. Distracted drivers have a slower reaction time meaning in case of an emergency where they need to make a quick move they won't be able to. Having that quick extinct when you're not distracted could make the difference between life and death.

Although people may say ""It was just a one time thing, I barely text while driving."" Science begs a differ, during recent years it has been studied that texting while driving has become a huge epidemic. Scientist have even compared it to craving junk food, stating that like junk food we crave being on our phones. Study shows that the average person check their phone once every 12 minutes and 80 times a day. So using your phone while driving can definitely become a habit even if you just do it a ""couple times"".

In conclusion, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and others people lives. Putting up your cell phone and waiting until you're at a stable place can save your life. No one should put themselves or others at risk to reply to a text message. Even if you're hands-free it can still distract you on the road and make you unable to make detrimental last minute decisions.

Due to the number of accidents that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal.

A study from the Harvard Center of Risk Analysis estimates that cell phone use while driving contributes to 6 percent of crashes, which equates to 636,000 crashes, 330,000 injuries, 12,000 serious injuries and 2,600 deaths each year. Due to the number of accidents that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Cell phone use contributes to 6% of crashes, and drivers are at a four times greater risk of a crash.

Smartphones have made it easy for us to stay connected at all times. But that can pose serious safety risks if someone decides to check his or her text messages, emails, phone calls, or any other mobile applications while driving. Cell phone distraction rates are alarmingly high. Worst of all, the usage of cell phones before car accidents happen is known to be underreported due to potential legal issues. Using a mobile phone while driving is reckless behavior, and every single crash that happens due to it can be prevented.

The safest possible way to use a cell phone while driving would be to attach it to the radio system or another suitable hands free device via Bluetooth. The hands free device does not guarantee safety either. While the distraction from using such technology is significantly smaller, it might still cause an accident. So there is no better decision than to simply postpone calls until you have arrived at your destination.

In conclusion, humans should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can cause accidents, and even worse death. Using cell phones while driving can put us at great risk, so just wait until you get to your destination                                   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Phones and driving are two bad combinations. They can lead to serious danger and harm.

People must be careful on now they use their phones while driving as it can lead to major accidents or worse. I think drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Cell phones are major distraction when driving. People/drivers can't help but to pick them up and use them. This could keep the drivers focus off the main thing which would be paying attention to the road. In these cases it could potentially be dangerous as they could cause an accident.

Next texting is also another reason why cell phones shouldn't be in the drivers capacity. Drivers often check their phones for messages or calls. This causes the driver to take his/her eyes off the road and cause an accident in a split second. The highest number of accidents come from texting and driving. This can is a major problem.

Finally music is also a problem as most times the driver don't listen to the radio as they more than often listen to the bluetooth connected to the phone. The driver may not want to listen to a certain song and try to change it which would make him/her take their eyes off the road. It could also lead to them getting badly injured.

In conclusion driving with phones is bad. We must try not to use phones as much as possible when driving it may save our lives as well as others. Doing this could also bring the accident percentage down. This could save thousands of lives maybe even more.         ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

How is driving cars dangerous in today's world? Well cars today go a lot faster and are very dangerous. They can cause deaths very easy by hitting just about anything or total your car. You can get distracted or cause a wreck and put other people lives in danger just by you getting in one. This how I think today vehicles are dangerous.

How do I think using a phone and driving is dangerous at the sametime? When using a phone while driving you might end up in the other lane or running a light or something. When doing that you can easily cause a wreck and be in the wrong by hurting other people and for being on your phone. That's why tickets are so high for being on your phone while driving. I think people shouldn't use they phone while driving in today life.

These are my thoughts on today about using cell phones and driving. I think texting and driving or using a phone while driving should be stopped.

Statistics show that every year 1.6 million crashes happen because of cell phone use. I believe that sometimes you may really need your phone for emergencies but with the new technology, there are safer ways to answer the phone while driving. I truly believe cell phone use shouldn't be allowed while operating a vehicle for the safety of ourselves and others.

Over the past few years cell phone use has become one of the leading causes for car accidents. So why would people continue to put themselves in that situation daily ? Cell phones are an addiction, its proven that swiping on some of the apps we have causes our brain to release dopamine. I know how it is getting that notification and automatically wanting to grab your phone and that's also a reason why so many teen car accidents happen. Teens are the majority of whats on social media, and not every teen realizes the seriousness of driving.

Even Though cell phones are dangerous while operating a vehicle these days with all the new technology it is safer to talk to people on the phone while driving without having to really be on your phone. A lot of new cars have a bluetooth, so you don't really have to ever touch your phone. These newer cars give you great technology to basically have a touch screen ""radio"" that gives you access to itunes, messages, and more. Now for the people who don't have a newer car there is an alternative for y'all. Nowadays you see a lot of people with an attachment on the inside of there windshield that holds their phone, even people with the new technology in their cars. These options make using your phone safer and easier in cases of emergency, or just to use gps.

Although cell phone use and driving don't correlate, the new technology in cars and cell phone holders give people safer options. People should definitely take the dangers of using devices into consideration and the safety of their kids. One day your kids will be teens and you don't want to give them the impression that cell phone use in a vehicle is ok.               ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

There are certain things that can't (and actually SHOULDN'T) be done while using a phone. Because of this, people are obsessed with the things they usually do on their phones. However, there is a certain action that is most likely not advised when a phone is involved due to the end results that will occur.

Out of the millions of people who use their phones daily, a large amount people will do a usual activity with it while driving. Texting is the main problem that goes on when people drive because there will be full on conversations that will cause distracted driving to become of the driver. Literally hundreds or more of people have either ended up injured or died because of texting and driving. This is not the only problem phones will cause with driving, however. Unfortunately, there are more ways that phones will cause accidents with driving.

People will be having a hard time trying to talk to others in a phone call while either one or the latter would happen to be driving to where they need to be. Unless anybody can really hold their phone in one hand and steer the car with the other, the chances of dropping that phone and looking for it will result in accidents and/or death. Not just that can cause injuries because there are unintended calamities just from only looking from a song on the phone because the radio doesn't have enough songs. All these things may cause just a random person to swerve off the road and hit either an object or roadwork in progress, then have a busted car and body.

There are solutions, however, that prevent accidents and fatalities caused from the distraction of phones. Hands - free technology can allow drivers to use their phones without having to use the screen, but also keeps little interference from random calls because of the use of wireless connection and Bluetooth. Laws are also used to keep people from being occupied with their phones, only for the sole reason of to keep people safe and prevent fatalities. Stoplights may provide a temporary break, but they are or are not enough to have time for checking social media updates depending on traffic.

Countless amounts of people have been having accidents, so there have been efforts to stop distracted driving and texting by including laws and different ways to keep focused on the road. Too many people have been hurt just from using their phones when they're driving, even if it's unintentional. There may be a solution in the future that will help to lower the overall rate of accidents from distracted driving caused by use of phones.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Driving is a dangerous thing for everyone in the vehicle. The driver needs to stay focused for everyone's safety. It is impossible to multitask while driving a four-thousand pound vehicle.

Also Apple has a block on the phone while driving.

In many states, it is illegal to use your phone while driving because it can cause an accident. When the phone vibrates the driver normally looks down at the phone to see why it made the ringing sound, but in the minutes, that it takes the driver to reply to the texts something can go wrong. The moment they look at the phone, they are putting everyone in danger including themselves. Sometimes people do not realize that there is someone in front them until it's too late and ends up killing someone or crashing into an object.

With people texting and driving it creates more car accidents and even deaths. The cell phone is an attention grabber that causes deaths. In the US, the government has recently been putting laws on phones being used while driving. Around the world texting and driving should be stopped to prevent any car accidents and deaths.

When a car accident happens it's not always because the person who caused it simply hit the other person but was on their phone. It states that 38% of people ages 18-24 surveyed to see if they know their own state laws on texting and driving. Within those 38% only 55% said it was illegal to text and drive. 14% of car crashes that were fatal were caused by cellphones and in 2018 4,637 people were killed due to texting and driving. People that use their smartphones while driving have the urge to pick it up and answer the phone or reply to a text message.

In 2016 3,450 fatalities were caused by drivers on their phones. Texting and driving is the leading cause of teen deaths, and about 3,000 teens die each year from texting and driving.

Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a greater risk of a crash. Although drivers know the risks and dangers of using a phone while driving, people still use it because they want to use it and be able to be in touch with other people. I advise people that are driving to not use their cell phones while driving because it can be a major distraction.

The cases of fatal automobile accidents, related to cell phone use while driving, have risen dramatically over the past few years. Majority of these people are younger people under the age of 25 years old or even younger. The cell phone use while driving causes more negative incidents than positive incidents. It causes road rage from other drivers, traffic jams, and minor accidents. I think that using a phone while driving is underrated, studies show that it is more dangerous than most people make it out to be; teenagers seems to be the worst at it.

Some people think that texting on a cellphone is considered the only thing when they say ""stop using your cell phone and driving"". Using a cellphone while driving means doing everything whether it is texting or talking on the phone. I've learned a lot about using a phone and driving from researching.

Many may say that using cellphones while driving is dangerous and that the shouldn't be used while driving, but actually there are more pros than cons. You have apps now that let you use your phone while driving without actually touching your phone. Its pure fact that if not many but all teens that are in school and driving stress about school, life, etc. With students and people in general stressing, They may lead to hit and runs and cameras on phones can clearly help identify or capture the drivers or their licenses plate.

While many may complain about how driving while using your phone is dangerous and this and that, they probably have been living under a rock for the past couple of years because there has been this new feature that has been around for a couple years now it called ,hands-free feature. It lets you do about everything you would be capable of doing if you were actually touching and your phone. On the website ""drivingschool. net"", they stated that ""a hands free mobile phone can minimize such issue, allowing driver to make calls without taking their eyes off the road or their hands off the wheel.""

Hit and Run drivers do exist. On the website ""newsroom. aaa. com"" they claimed that,"" Hit-and-Runs deaths in the US have increased an average of 7.2 percent each year since 2009."" The cameras on phones allow for drivers to take pictures of license plate numbers. In the past year its been reported that the percentage from 8% to 12% and those where from how many Hit-and-Runs where caught in only 2019.

Yes, although many people have stated that teenagers get distracted while driving due to their phones its also proven that using phones while driving driving may be beneficial. People love to complaining and talk about how teenagers get distracted while driving due to their phones but they always bring up the irresponsible one or the more reckless ones as an example. There are people that drive perfectly fine and are capable of using their phones that exist. Many people don't like bringing those type of people up because they want to make a point.

As i've been stating now this entire time, yes using your phone while driving may be beneficial but its also dangerous. So im not stating that you need to starting doing it always just when neccessary . Using your phone while driving may be useful but remember your safety comes first.

Now with modern technology many people have devices were you can look at your phone while you're driving instead of holding it in your hand because it is illegal, which I feel makes it even more dangerous than talking on your phone while driving. There's honestly no reason to be talking and driving, it's not worth the consequences.

For starters, 13% of car crash fatalities are caused by distracted driving. I know that it may not sound like a lot but that's almost 35,000 people reported to have died due to looking at their phone while operating a vehicle. There are things like phone holders and things that can go into your care to hold your phone while driving, but that makes and even bigger distraction.

People are responding to text messages, being on facetime calls (that's video chat), watching videos, etc. While driving thinking that it's safer to be on your phone this way not realizing that their chances of crashing is higher than having the phone in your hand. Taking your eyes off the road for even a quick second could cause you to crash into anything, causing harm to possibly you and other drivers and pedestrians around you.

Next , I feel like honestly if you need to talk on the phone that bad or need to respond to a text that bad pull over, that message from your boyfriend can wait till your safely parked somewhere it's not worth your life to respond to a message, it's not worth the jail time you might face if you crash and you're at fault, it's not worth the extra money you would have to face to fix your car if you crash if it not totaled at the scene, it's not worth the pain to your body and all the medical expenses if you get hurt in the crash. That perfect driving playlist can wait, the phone call you missed can be returned when you're not operating your vehicle, my point is there are so many outcomes and possibilities you can avoid while staying off your phone while you are driving.

Lastly, in case people forgot it is indeed illegal to talk on the phone and drive or to be on your phone period. 38 of our 50 states have a no cell phone ban on novice and teen drivers since it's mostly teens texting and driving not saying our adults don't text and drive because they most definitely do. Now even though the law says you cannot use your phone while you're driving and if you do it needs to be in a hands free device , it's still does not prevent you from crashes it does not prevent you from driving of the road from not keeping your eyes on the road. Only if you're under 18 you are required not to use your phone completely. There are devices approved the government like in ear Bluetooth that are allowed to be used while driving so I can be less of a distraction while driving but let's face it, it's probably as much as a distraction as the hands-free devices. For example, I know for my when I'm talking on the phone its most likely to one of my friends so I'm probably gossiping, and when that's happening, I'm zoning out of whatever I am doing to completely engage into the conversation. If you're not going to pay attention to the road you really do not need to be driving.

In conclusion, cell phone use while driving should not be allowed at all, there are so many possibilities and outcomes that can come from using your phone while operating your vehicle. It is not safe at all for you or the other drivers and some cases pedestrians around you. It's not worth the danger of your life or anyone else's life, it's not worth any of the consequences just put your phone down and drive or don't drive at all.

When on the driving it is a great responsibility to make sure that you refrain from doing anything that might distract you from driving. One mistake can cause you get to hurt including others around you.

If you get caught by the police you can get a ticket for it or worse. Majority of the people today don't care.

One of the most controversial arguments is that of texting or talking on the phone while driving. This controversial argument is debated all of the world and why or why not it's wrong. Regardless of opinions, there are statistics and facts on using your phone and driving. The facts say that it's not the right thing to do for a number of reasons such as accidents. The fact is that using your phone and driving is wrong for a lot and here's the reason why.

Approximately 660,000 drivers attempt to use their phones behind the wheel of a car every day. Smartphones have made it easy for us to stay connected at all times. But that can create serious risks if someone decides to check their phone when they're behind the wheel. Risks such as car crashes. The National Safety Council reports that people who use their cell phone while driving causes 1.6 million crashes each year. One out of every four accidents that take place in the US are due to cell phone usage and almost 390,000 injuries happen each year caused by texting and driving.

Texting and driving being dangerous enough, people also tend to talk on the cell phone while driving, which some people think is less dangerous than texting and driving but, there is still a number of safety hazards to worry about when talking on the phone and driving. One of the obvious rules to follow when driving is to keep both hands on the steering wheel while driving. Specifically ten and two, which they tell you when you go to get your driver's license. This action can't be achieved if one hand is holding the phone to your ear. There are some exceptions to talking on the phone and driving such as having speaking on the phone and connecting it to the car via, bluetooth. This is hand free and therefor not dangerous.

Due to the number of crashes and accident that are related to making calls on the phone and texting while driving, some states have made it illegal to use the phone completely while driving. Cell phone use has also become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. While talking on the phone or texting, drivers are distracted decreasing the driver's awareness while they are on the road, which lead to a number of crashes. Drivers who text that are behind the wheel are twenty-three times more likely to have a crash.

In conclusion, texting or talking on the phone while driving is not safe for anyone. It will more than likely cause an accident and people can wait to make that one phone call or that last text. Risking your life is not worth it. Driving while using cell phones should be a thing of the past. Texting and driving should not be done anymore and nobody should suffer from crashes or accidents due to a driver using their phone while behind the wheel.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Using a phone while driving is insane. Drivers should not be allowed to operate any type of vehicle while one a cellular device. So much can happen in a split second that can cause a reck or someones life to be taken and for what a response to ""what's for dinner?"". Why take on the burden of taking a life and just put the phone down. Using any type of cellular device that causes distractions while driving has been proven to be extremely dangerous life threatening.

Experts like crash test specialist, police officers, and many research companies that have focused on seeing how dangerous phone usage while driving is have proven that its extremely dangerous. The reason of using a cellular device while driving is because it draws the attention of the driver away from the road cause risk of lane change into oncoming traffic, hitting a person or animal or damage to property. A lot of excuses for people are ""oh, i can multitask"" or ""i know what i'm doing"" but the truth is those people truly can't. People claiming they can multitask or they know what they are doing are wrong and push a great risk.

Why risk getting pulled over or taking a life. Majority of pullovers and crashes involves texting and driving or intoxication. With all these warnings and restrictions and risks people still use cellular devices while driving. One day maybe people will finally put down the phones and release the true danger of out. Put down the phone focus on the road the use of a cellular device is dangerous.      ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time.

Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones.

Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons. One the driver can be distracted. Two it's dangerous to other people on the road . And then diverts attention away from the road and and other drivers and the consequences could be dire.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use.

Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us. Drivers who use cell phones while driving are also highly dangerous to pedestrians.

Ranging from the age of 13-60+ most people around those ages has a smartphone which can put all their attention on their devices. The whole world is revolve around smartphones, kids at a young age instead of running around and playing outside like kids used to do, nowadays all they do is focus on their smart technologies, it's very rare to see a kid off their devices unless they are in school or doing homework. Teens are heavily addicted to their phones, if a teenager loses their phones they act like they lost their whole world, they get very sensitive and gets angry at everything if they lose their phones. Teens can't learn from the adults since the adults acts the very same or even worse than teens, smartphones to adults is their way to escape the hard real truth of the world, and it can also act as a way for teens or adults to communicate with others if they are unsociable in real life.

Driving is a thing most adults and 16+ teens do, they use the cars to drive to work, school, or go to a place where they can have fun. To teens driving is the first thing teens will do to start taking the responsibility of being an adult, but for some reason even though you're supposed to keep your eyes on the road teens and adults alike are on their phone texting and driving which is as bad as drinking and driving. Teens cant follow the adults who they look up too since the adults themselves are setting a bad example by texting and driving which give teens a sign saying it's ok to text and drive. I've been in minor car accidents due to teens or adults on their phones not paying attention on the road, I've also seen many of my older relatives go on their phones while on the road.

There are laws set in place already to ban texting and driving which means due to how many accidents and murders there has been due to people texting and driving on the road. Cops can pull you over and give you a ticket just for texting and driving if they have suspicions of you being on your phone. It is not worth getting a $200 ticket for texting and driving, you should wait until you are at your destination or at least pull into a parking lot to see your texts if they are that important. I do not support the use of texting and driving due to the high risk that involves with usage of a technology while driving, phone companies such as Apple or Samsung should create an app that forcefully locks your phone while you are driving so that you cannot see the texts or send back text.

Overall, texting and driving is as worse or maybe even worse than drinking and driving due to everyone having a cell phone and not everyone is at the legal age to drink alcohol. Texting and driving can happen in any part of the day while drinking and driving is usually around night time due to how everyone drinks when it get dark outside.

E94074738406,"Operation of Cell-Phones While Driving and Why it's Useful

Imagine a scenario in which we lived in a society of the past; where we never developed cell-phones or gps technology. We would still require maps of areas we travel, and areas we would require directions for would be marginally more difficult to traverse. People would be unaware of the most efficient way to get from place to place by being incapable of receiving updates on the state of traffic in progress. In our current society and with our current regulation around cell phones have resulted in a best-case-scenario that balances the reward from using such technology and the reducing the dangers that they present.

One of the best things about modern travel is the gps technology that all people have access to. In all of our phones, people have a location option they can turn on. Using this, the phone can communicate with GPS satellites and give people directions to any location that people desire to travel to with things like Google Maps. This makes perfect sense to use in conjunction with operating a motor vehicle, and since it makes the roads easier to travel it should not be punished.

Not only do phones reduce traffic by providing people with the most effective way of reaching their location, but they also give updates that wouldn't necessarily be given otherwise. GPS does this by providing people with traffic options and traffic updates, which works by calculating how many users are on each road. This information is useful because the wider-spread the technology is, the more information can be collected to provide more accurate data to represent traffic effectively. This indirectly reduces traffic by providing alternative routes of travel.

One argument against the use of phones in vehicles is that they encourage distracted and dangerous driving. While this risk is undeniably present, restrictions on the use of phones is an action most states are implementing currently. The exact implementation differs from state to state, but most laws are ""Hands off"" laws, meaning that drivers can be pulled over and fined for driving for having one hand holding a phone. This reduces risk by discouraging distracted driving, but not punishing those who use phones in vehicles responsibly. Hopefully in the next few years, studies will show these laws to be effective.

In conclusion, using phones provide many beneficial effects to our society in regards to driving. The objective of any regulation should be to reduce the risks of distracted driving by discouraging the act. To completely restrict the usage of phones in cars would be detrimental to how we operate as a society. Effective implementation of Hands-Off laws will hopefully show results that reduce the risks surrounding phones in vehicles. A balance between regulation and effective and responsible use is what we should strive to achieve.

Sometimes people are so into these smartphones that they don't pay attention to their surroundings especially if you are using them while driving. Using your phone while driving is not and will never be safe. Not even at stop lights because if you aren't paying attention to your surroundings you can ruin the experience for others by not going when you are supposed to.

If you are anything like me, you like to use your phone a lot and you spend hours on it daily. That's completely fine but if you are using your phone to change a song, check Instagram, etc. While driving you aren't paying attention to what's going on around you and you can hurt yourself or others with you. Phones should never be used when driving it's dangerous not even just for you or the other people in the car but also the people around. If you aren't aware of what is going on around you can crash into another vehicle and you might end up being fine but then they end up dead and it would be your fault and you would get charged with vehicular manslaughter. Respect the law they are in place to protect people from reckless stuff like this.

There are laws in place in order to stop people from using their phones while driving so that they can keep people safe. If people followed the law like they were supposed to accidents wouldn't happen as much as they do now a day. Now I do understand if you absolutely must call someone like the cops or if your wife is having your child if it is absolutely necessaire use the phone as much as you'd like.

Would you ever drive the length of a football field at 55 mph blindfolded? Well that's essentially what you're doing when texting while driving. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, texting behind the wheel takes a driver's eye off the road for an average of 4.6 seconds, which is the time it takes to go from one end zone to the other. Dangerous? Incredibly. Deadly? You bet. Texting while driving has now replaced drinking and driving as the leading cause of death among teenage drivers.

Teenagers are not the only ones guilty. According to a survey conducted by AT&T, 49 percent of American adult drivers admitted they text while driving. In that same survey, more than 90 percent of drivers know texting while driving is dangerous. So why are we still doing it? Experts believe we compulsively check our phones because every time we get an alert on our phone our brain sends out a signal that makes us feel happy. Drivers are saying they continue to do this because it's a habit, like to stay connected and it makes them feel more productive.

Over the past decade, technology has been deeply integrated into our lives to the point where we couldn't live without it. One of those technologies is our phones. Phones are constantly being used; from texting and talking to watching movies and playing games. People are constantly using them and it seems like you can't go anywhere without your phone. Because of this, there's been a dramatic rise in car accidents caused by phone distractions. States have passed laws banning cell phone use while driving, however, this really hasn't achieved much.

There are still many people looking down at their laps instead of looking at the road. Phones are helpful while driving for things like navigation or music, but drivers shouldn't be checking their social media or texting while driving. This diverts their focus from what's happening on the road, leading to an accident. While driving, drivers shouldn't be able to use their phones.

In the United States alone nearly 390,000 car accidents occur each year due to drivers being on their phones. ""1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.""(Snyder). A survey done by CBS News found that ""98 percent of motorists who own cellphones and text regularly said that they were aware of the dangers, yet three-quarters of them admitted to texting while driving...""(Ap, 1). So even though most people are aware of the dangers, why do they continue you to use their phones while driving? According to the same CBS article, most of the people who do use their phones believe they're good multi-taskers. In the article, they said, ""drivers believed they can ""easily do several things at once, even while driving"".""(Ap, 3). Most of these drivers honestly believe that they are competent enough to use their phones while driving but despite all their confidence, texting while driving is still ""6 times more likely to cause an accident than drunk driving""(Snyder, 1). In a survey conducted in 2014 about 28% of the people surveyed said, ""they are worried about missing out of something important if they don't check their phones right away.""(Ap, 9). Another group, ""believed that others expect them to respond to texts ""right away"".""(Ap, 10). And a small percentage believed that they are, ""addicted to texting""(Ap, 11). For most of these people, it seems almost impossible for them to put their phones down for even a second. The constant use and over-reliance on phones have caused them to become very dependent on them. That means even while driving they are focusing on what's happening in the digital world on their phones, and not on the road they are driving on.

There are studies out there that say that banning cell phone use while driving has more positive effects than negative and that there are many benefits for allowing its use on the road. A study done by Harvard University found that using cell phones while driving, ""Decreased emergency response times/improved life-saving outcomes""(Ropeik,3). This is a common argument habitual cell phone users make. They say that they will be able to report an emergency or accident faster if they have their cell phones already in their hands, but the truth is that they are the ones that will probably cause that accident. Another argument made is, ""I was at a stoplight!"" (Schule, 5). This is one of the most common excuses made by drivers caught using their phones. They believe if they're stopped that they aren't a danger, however, this isn't the case. A poll done by the Huff Post revealed that 63% of drivers, aged between 18-29, text at red traffic lights. Another statistic showed that, ""More than 20 percent of distracted drivers age 15 to 19 involved in fatal crashes were distracted by cell phones...""(""Texting At A Red Light"", 4).

While on the road it is never safe to text, even while at a stoplight. ""Stalling to text could lead to rear-end crashes if the other drivers notice the light turn green first.""(""Texting At A Red Light"", 5). Almost, ""28% of all automobile accidents...""(Ryan, 1), are caused by rear-end collisions.

This is considered one of the largest categories of car accidents in the entire United States. One of the most common causes of rear-ends is distracted driving.

Most people believe that they are skilled enough drivers to be able to drive with distractions, but that's just not the case. This ignorance has caused thousands of people to lose their lives every year. You are more likely to die in a car accident than a plane crash, and that's because of how easy it is to be distracted while driving. Imagine a loved one being involved in a fatal accident because a driver was on their phone. It would be devastating. Phones have become such a huge part of our daily lives, and we should be able to utilize them in order to help better them. The bottom line is, they have the potential to cause a lot of damage when they aren't used appropriately and they should not be used while driving.

Teens between the ages 16 to 19 are more likely to be involved in a fatal car accident than any other age group. I think teens in that age group are afraid of missing out or (FOMO) basically the desire to stay connected with what others are doing at all times. A subconscious habit that causes drivers to feel the need to know what other people are doing constantly. Texting while being behind the wheel takes the drivers eyes off the road for 4.6 seconds which is the same amount of time it would take to travel the length of a football field.

We shouldn't be able to use cell phones while driving to protect us and others around us. It is many temptations when we are driving but we got to remember that we drive for others not ourselves. More than 1000 drivers are injured every day due to distracted drivers and we got to limit the distractions for drivers.

Texting while driving is illegal.

As of July 1st of 2018 Georgia Governor Nathan Deal passed a law prohibiting the use of a handheld phone while driving. The Hand free law first conviction is a fair $50 fine and 1 point assigned to their driver's license. Second conviction fine is a $100 and 2 points added to driver's license. You can receive jail time if you are a continuous offender. I do believe that the consequences of violating this law is fair and should be complied by.

Texting while driving is becoming a growing problem throughout the United States. Many of the offenders of this crime are teenagers. Being distracted while driving not only puts you in danger, but it also puts the other people on the road in danger as well. Many people have died as a result of other people texting while driving. Being distracted while on the road, no matter what it is that you're doing can be highly dangerous to everyone involved.

Over 90 percent of crashes are the fault of drivers. The most frequent driver mistake is ""recognition error,"" which encompasses driver's inattention, internal and external distractions, and inadequate surveillance."" In other words, most crashes are not caused by flagrantly intoxicated people, nor that driver who will do whatever it takes to get to their destination one minute earlier. Most crashes are caused by people like you and me who think they can pay attention to the road and do something else at the same time. When you are engaged in conversation, be it on a call or texting or even with someone else in the car your attention is divided.

Texting while driving is a real life situation and more people are at risk by the minute. Of course some people may not care about the effects of them texting while driving but other people do. Being patient and waiting to send a text could save many lives. It starts with you. Take a stap and save lives.                                      ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
9642AB15DD6E,"Cell phones have become increasingly prevalent in the 21st century, made even more popular by the introduction of smartphones. Having access to the internet on demand has led to people being more informed but also made driving more dangerous. Many drivers nowadays drive and do many other things, usually on their smartphones. Texting and driving is almost always looked down upon but talking on the phone and driving is still seen as ok. Distracted driving kills over 1000 drivers a year and 600 pedestrians a year. These numbers could be cut down on if drivers were encouraged to just figuratively 'disconnect.'

Many smartphones apps have taken up the mantle to send messages telling whoever is messaging the driver that they are behind the wheel. This is a great solution to keeping drivers, both teenage and adult, eyes on the road instead of on their phone. These apps may just be the future for smartphones and driving. Another good solution for distracted driving is teenagers should be encouraged to take a step back from electronics every once in a while in order to do something else, like read a book, or spend time with family. This could encourage driving not plague by distractions.

Many teachers and employers can help in this as well. Distracted driving is everywhere. Educators could certainly spread awareness about the dangers of distracted driving (""Distracted Driving,"" NHTSA). The few and far between presentations about distracted driving a year help some but there could be some more awareness outside of school. Maybe advertisements and the sort. Advertising got adolescent smoking down from 9% to just 5% before the popularization of Juuls and Vapes. Why can't that be done again?

The final reason to cut back on cell phone use while driving is that people who text and drive are less likely to wear a seat belt (""Cell Phone Use While Driving"" teendriverresource. org). This is another good reason why a bigger effort should be made to stop distracted driving.

Distracted driving kills more drivers than pedestrians, cyclists, and passengers. Oftentimes, the driver who was distracted dies in the accidents caused and the person who is crashed into usually lives because they are paying attention and wearing their seatbelt. This is why distracted driving should be cut down on. It kills over 1700 drivers a year ('Cell Phone Use While Driving').

Overall distracted driving is definitely an epidemic causing over 3000 deaths a year that can be avoided by just disconnected. By encouraging disconnection, people won't be as liable to pick their phone up in general, causing less distracted driving. Getting awareness out makes not just teenage drivers, but also young adults and older people aware of the dangers of driving.

Distracted drivers oftentimes don't wear seatbelts either causing even more undue deaths. With just a little more effort, distracted driving could be a thing of the past.

Although cell phones haven't been around for the longest time, they have become an essential part of our lives. Cars and other vehicles have become great assets in daily life as well. Combining the two, however, is a terrible idea. Texting and driving is extremely dangerous, and leads to nearly a million and a half crashes per year. It switches the focus from the road to your hand, and makes you a weapon, capable of easily ending someone's life. Texting and driving is a product of this generation because it takes your attention off the road, is caused by a lack of responsibility, and causes a forth of all car accidents per year.

The teenage generation causes a large majority of accidents due to their lesser experience, but also because of their addiction to social media. They are easily absorbed into their phones, unable to realize that a truck is turning into you. One moment, your texting your best friend about kittens, the next your bones are broken, and you hang from the floor, your car upside down at the bottom of a hill.

This extremely deadly situation has a very easy solution; put the device in your pocket!

However, the temptation to do otherwise leads to those situations. Sometimes it's not their fault, though. Some teens aren't taught how to be responsible with their electronics, and later in life, their eyes are still glued to that screen. They then have to learn the hard way, by wrecking. That's why we should teach the younger generation about safety, texting and driving, and to pay attention to the road.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
67204B22ED12,"Human beings have invented some amazing technology, one such example is the smartphone this device plays a role in the daily life of everyone who has one, whether it be for communication, GPS, or even paying for store bought goods, however should these same devices be used while on the road? The answer to that is no, a smartphone offers too many distractions such as social media, games, videos, and much more. This is evident by recent laws such as the hands off law, which prohibits drivers from touching their device while driving. This is also evident by car accidents caused by one or more drivers being too occupied by their smartphone. With this being said, smartphones are definitely a hazard while used on the road.

Social media when used on a phone can be a wonderful thing, it keeps you in contact with friends, family, and even your fellow co-workers, however, it can also be a major distraction. As humans use social media chemicals in their brain are released, these chemicals are called dopamine, and in humans it's what makes us decide we like whatever we're doing, thus a habit is formed. This habit if not controlled can lead to constant checking of a person's phone, including when in the car, which could lead to catastrophic accidents and even death while on the road. This and the added distractions of potential passengers could create an even more dangerous environment.

Gaming can be a great hobby despite what people say, this includes mobile games, but they can also be a great distraction on the road. The same chemical mentioned earlier is released when you play games, it's what makes them entertaining, and for some people it makes them need that one last level on Candy Crush or to complete that one last quest on games like Clash

Royale. Some people decide to do this when driving, once again endangering their fellow drivers, as well as any passengers in their car. This helps prove the point of smartphone use shouldn't be allowed in the car because there have been plenty of car and motorcycle accidents due to this. The more people want to do something, the greater the release of dopamine is when their craving is finally fed.

Some people like to play videos in the car while they drive, while that's ok for some people to do, there are still exceptions to this. People who have low attention spans as well as people who like to pay more attention to the video rather than the road are more likely to crash than someone who just plays music from their phone in the car. The reasoning behind this is simple, a music video is more likely to be watched than someone simply opening a music streaming app and playing the song. Other people like to watch movies or just normal YouTube videos adding to the risk factor. This all leads to the hands off law.

The hands off law, as mentioned earlier, outlaws the use of any type of cellular device while driving, creating a safer environment for all drivers. Some people may ask, ""What if the police don't catch everyone who uses their phone while driving?"" That can only be helped by us humans putting down these devices while on the road, while there are laws in place, not everyone follows them, and officers can't always catch everyone. This leads back to the starting statement, no, smartphones should not be allowed while people use the road, because as human beings, no matter who you are, you can still be distracted by your device.

To start off this issue we are going to go over the law of this. Almost all states including some without cellphone rules prohibit text messaging while driving. In most of these states, you can be pulled over and cited for texting as a primary offense. Distracted driving very dangerous. In an older time there was no problem with this, Therefore as I said in my introduction that it is indeed my generation who's careless driving cause the law of no texting and driving to be made. Not to mention if you get pulled over the driver may obtain a monetary fine which can range from as low as 20 or 500 dollars depending on the state that is.

Secondly, The National Safety Council reports that using a cell phone while driving is the reason for 1.6 million crashes each year. Almost 390,000 injuries happen each year, from accidents caused by texting while driving. One out of every four car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. That's a lot of deaths caused by loss of focus you would think people would learn. Just a little to add, but according to NHTSA, driving while texting is six times more dangerous than drunk driving. Read into it my people.

In my conclusion texting and driving is more dangoroue in many ways more than one belive me.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

What should happen about the phones and driving issues plaguing society.

As humans in our time we revolve around our phones at almost all times. From texting and long distance calls to games and GPS it has a connection to our phone. Driving already is dangerous because of all the imperfections we carry. We need to be alert at all times because if we lose focus for a bit that portion of time will ruin a life.

When we drive our phones should be used for GPS only or for emergency phone calls. We have fatalities and injuries being born from use of phones while in a vehicle that is in motion. There may be a wide array of factors that go into causing a wreck it's understandable.

Your focus is what allows you to react to a sudden situation, if and when you lose focus you may meet a surprise motorist that wants to say hello. Anything that is done will upset someone while satisfying another. Improvement MUST be made at the basic level of human thought if we are to increase safety of drivers.

The best outcome is to reduce the reason to be on the phones and say no to this addiction.

As technology improves and grows we need to grow with it. Focus on one thing at a time so you may live your lives with less stress.        ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Thousands of accidents happen every year, and a high percentage of them involve distractions, on either end of each driver involved. Adding phones to the risk only increases the chances of crashing. D.U.I is a lead cause of accidents, but it is safer than texting and driving, statistically. It has become restricted and illegal in certain parts of the world, and for good reason. Many deaths and injuries are caused by simple mistakes. The risks are extremely high and only increase as new drivers appear on the road. Phone-related accidents have become common since 2010 (Zebra pg.1) and are even more of a risk forward from then. With more technology-invested generations of new drivers and even adults that use phones a great deal more today, accidents involving phones are more prone to happen, becoming very common.

The statistics do not support using a phone while driving. In fact, 1.6 million crashes on average per year are caused by phone use while driving while 390 thousand injuries are caused by these crashes and 3 thousand deaths are averaged between them respectively. (Edgar synder and assc. pg.1) The amount of people that are distracted while driving is even higher than the accident rate, with surveys conducted having an average of 30% of answers admittedly stating distraction while driving is common for these drivers. Unfortunately, watching Netflix, youtube or other streaming apps while driving is something done regularly, which is extremely dangerous to other people around them. It is 8 times more likely for a crash to occur when reaching for any object while driving, and even eating and drinking increases the risk by 3 times. Eating and drinking while driving is much more common than watching streaming apps. However, recklessness like that causes many accidents, which could have been avoided by being responsible.

1 out of 4 accidents are caused by texting and driving, which means other hand-held phone use causing accidents is entirely too dangerous considering it can have an 8 times more likely chance of causing accidents than regular driving respectively. With the 400 percent increase of not looking at the road, using a phone isn't the best idea. Thousands of accidents that happen even without distractions are the same level of lethality, which would warrant thinking twice before reaching for your phone. That is the theory, at least. Hopefully, there will be a way to show these drivers that the risks are far too high for a miniscule benefit of texting someone back immediately. Proper education on the dangers of distracted driving and how easily losing your life could be is important. Help others around you and warn them what could happen.

Life is precious, and losing it over texting back or looking at an email is not worth it. The risk is very high and thousands of people who had their lives ahead of them have been put down, when it could have been avoided. Statistics do not lie, and ignoring the risks will not end well. Study and research on these accidents is done for a reason- they keep happening. Living is more important than texting. Even laws can't protect you in the moment where the accident is going to occur. If you don't personally text and drive, you must still worry about others who refuse to cooperate. Encourage others to wait to text back if you want to save lives. Don't use your phone and drive.

? I say that you shouldn't be able to drive while on the phone because there are many reasons why. People might think it isn't a big deal to drive while on the phone but it really is because it's dangerous. Some things that you think can't happen while your on your phone can happen to you or anyone. I'm going to explain why it's a big deal to not be on your phone while your driving.

? The first reason why you shouldn't be on your phone while driving is because you can harm yourself. The way you can harm yourself is you can crash into something and get hurt. Or you can be on your phone and not know what is in front of you and end up hitting that object. And hearing is very important while driving because you need to hear your surroundings.

? My second reason is that you can also get distracted by the small things that you could've avoided. Like if your on your phone and a light turns red and the person in front of you stops you might hit them. And you might not have meant to but you weren't paying attention and now there is a problem. Also you can get distracted by listening to loud music and you can't hear if a cop car or fire truck is coming behind or in front of you.

? My last reason is that you can also harm someone else by being on your phone and not being aware. You can end up running into someone's car and hurting them really bad or even worse. That person can be harmed really bad and you might not be but that other person is. Then you have to explain why you got into that car accident and you don't know what to say because you were on your phone. Or even worse you might end up killing the person that you hit because you weren't paying attention because of a text message.

? I'm just mentioning all of these problems because being on your phone is a dangerous thing while driving. Things can happen to anyone that you run into by being distracted by the small stuff. Being distracted is a problem because it takes your eyes off the road. And then something can easily happen really fast and you won't even see it coming.

Texting and driving needs to stop now before more people get hurt. ADD is a big reason too for people have no choice but to get distracted on things which cause crashes.

Distraction is the main reason crashes happen, people get distracted on anything and everything and don't know what to do when they're about to crash. Phones are big distractions in the world today, especially in teens who just start driving, when they get a message the first thing they know to do is check it no matter what. To fix this problem states have inflicted heavier laws, for example Georgia has the no hands law and that means you can't have any hands on your phone at all, not even calls can be answered. Texting while driving is such a bad choice because it can cause you to swerve off road or swerve into someone's car. It's a bad habit in today's society and it needs to be stopped.

In conclusion texting and driving is all out bad, and needs to be stopped, there needs to be classes and more lessons taught on the effects of texting and driving. People need to also set an example for the new future because if it's not in forced more teens are liable to do it.      ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Cell phones can definitely be a huge distraction in someone's life when someone is using their cell phone they are not always paying attention to their surroundings because of how focused they are on their cell phone. This has become a big issue in how people drive.

Having a cell phone out when driving can be very dangerous. While driving you should be focused on the road only and if someone if is calling or texting you when you're driving and you decide to your phone you are then putting yourself and anyone else in the car with you in danger. If you use your phone while driving you are not only affecting who is in the car with you but you are affecting other cars around you. For example, if your using your phone while driving and don't see what's in front of you then you can hit a car in front of you or a tree or even run into a building.

With this being said cell phones shouldn't not be used while driving or operating a vehicle. Cell phones can cause car accidents or even deaths during use when driving. If you use a cell phone while you're driving you can also be holding up traffic. For instance, say you're driving and you stop at a red light and you pull out your phone you may be so focused on your phone that you don't notice the light turns green.

So this is why you should not use a phone while driving or even have it out.

Please everybody stay safe and don't use your phone while driving because its not that important and you can check it later.                                   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Drivers should NOT be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. One out of Four car accidents in the United States are caused by texting and driving. Driving while using a cell phone is dangerous. My brother Corey lost his life last year in May while driving and texting. Being distracted and looking down at a cell phone while driving at any speed can cause an accident. I don't need statistics or percentages or fancy facts from websites to come to that conclusion. Driving and cell phone use leads to death, injury of yourself and others, injury to your vehicle, destroys your clean driving record, increases your insurance rates and can causes psychological issues. Driving and cell phone can lead to jail time if the person doing it kills another person.

I believe that even using hands free devices or using Bluetooth in your vehicle can be distracting and shouldn't be allowed. A conversation can distract you from paying attention to your surroundings. Driving while using a cellphone reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37%.

What is surprising is, that a survey done by AT&T shows that 97% of teens surveyed agreed that texting while driving is dangerous. It shocked me to read that 43% of them still do it anyway. This proves that stricter laws need to be put in place to stop this from happening.

Any death or injury caused by cell phone use while driving is too many deaths. Drivers should not be using them while operating a vehicle. Laws should be changed or made stricter to stop accidents caused by using cell phones while driving. Any upside to having a cell phone while driving is not worth the damage it may cause. Before cell phones people drove without them and suffered no problems. Cell phones should be banned from use by the driver of a vehicle.

CB0A108B7695,"Is the cost to potentially end a life in a matter of seconds and cause collision in exchange to glance at your mobile smartphone worth the risk. Is it really worth causing harm to yourself and others to check if your smartphone received a notification. Do not risk the lives and safety of other people on the road because you're preoccupied with irrelevant phone use.

Issues such as accidents , deaths, tickets, etc can be avoided if the owner of the mobile device does not allow distraction by the device overcome them. Most drivers who usually drive while using their phone take matters such as the effects very lightly and not serious enough. They do not understand the consequences and the permanent changes when it comes to the controversy. Many drivers claim that there are no bad results or claim that all the fuss is unnecessary and exaggerated. What they do not comprehend is in a matter of seconds everything could be a blur and possibly be the end. When driving, the driver should take much precaution and take driving on the road very serious and not as a joking manner. Before even compulsing to use the mobile phone , think about who you as a driver could put in danger while on the road and think clearly while reflecting the consequences.

There are many forms to be away from the mobile device until the driver arrives at the destination to use the device once again. The driver must find strategies to help the bad habit end or find a way to resist the desire to obtain the device. Instead of having the compulsion to utilize the smartphone the driver can do many things to avoid causing accidents. For Example, if the driver has no need or hurry to arrive at the destination , what can be done is they can pull over on the side of the road or find a destination to park and have the liberty to use the cellular device.

Another useful strategy , could be to purchase a device that is Hands-Free Bluetooth Headset, which is a very effective technological device. By purchasing the device, it will reduce the constant movement to grab for the cellphone and revise it. The sole purpose of the device is to avoid the driver to grab the smartphone when there is an incoming phone call and occupy the device to make answering simpler. Also, causes no movement, only requires the driver to press a button and answer any incoming call without physically holding the phone, the device is only restricted to answer calls and listen to music.

There are certain states within the United states that yield the issue of obtaining a cellphone while driving. With having that issue and referring to fatal or minor accidents or issues relating to using cellphone causes the government to pass laws to better improve the issue. The cause to pass and enact the law over banning cellphone use while conducting a vehicle is from reports of fatal deaths, bodily injuries and many accidents have increased. There are some states that take note that majority of crashes or any incident involves the cellphone use. Despite efforts to control the use of cellphone calmly does not give any effect which leads to the enactment of the law. When using the cellular device comes a consequence to pay such as receiving tickets, fines and penalties will come along with not obeying the law. There will no longer be any tolerance of the mobile device use , if you are found at guilt , if the state you live in has passed a law over the driving no phone use.

One thing drivers will ignore and be naive to is the constant use of operating a vehicle with a cellphone in possession. It's unacceptable to be cause of a collision or even worse cause death to innocent driver due to the driver wanting to be on social media, talk on the phone,etc.

A driver can discover many useful methods to reduce the cellular use, such as using a Bluetooth Headset to answering or simply parking on the side of the road to attend the cellphone. Before causing harm put others people lives before the irrelevant technology that can be used later on. Take precaution, be aware of consequences and be reasonable if using the mobile device while driving which should only be used if there is an emergency or utilizing a Wireless device to answer phone calls.

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating. Reasons why are because far too many accidents have occurred because of texting and driving. If a driver uses a device while driving it limits their ability to operate the vehicle. Its equally important to have your mind free of distractions while driving. Each day in the United States approximately 9 people are killed and over 1,000 people were injured due to a distracted driver.

Even bluetooth devices shouldnt be used while driving. The brain tends to use a lot of its visual processing abilities. Talking on the phone may seem to need the use of only your ears, but your ears send a signal to a part of your brain that creates images which is why when your talking on the phone you picture that person in your mind. For example someone asks you a question over the phone, like where did you put the tape? You'll imagine the last place you put it.

These are my reasons and good reasons why drivers should not be able to use cellular devices in any capacity while operating a vehicle.    ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Should you or should you not text and drive? In today's world texting and driving is illegal, and yet some people still do it. Are they taking this law serious? Police haven't been cracking down on this law like we thought they would, but how's it possible that yes they are police officers and they have a job to do just like everybody else but they drive with a computer next to there hands, but people can't text and drive. Don't get me wrong I am for the no texting and driving law, but if we can cause a wreck with phones, they can definitely cause a wreck looking at a laptop. At the end of each day we have a law to obey.

In my experience, which isn't much i'd say no texting and driving. I'm with the law that was passed so my safety and so others safety are always available. At the same time people still do not listen to the law and still get into wrecks and still get tickets but turn around and do it all over again. For this law to be passed it's basically to make people feel better because still to this day you see a police you put the phone down, they pass its right back in your hand. What good is that helping? Not only are you putting yourself in danger you're putting the other cars in danger with you because at any given moment you can look up and the light won't be green anymore, or pedestrians will be crossing the road. I understand emergencies happen and you need your phone but at the same time there is bluetooth and onstar for that reason exactly. It's not much you needing to be on the phone, you want to be on the phone, you're so use to it being in your hand that you constantly got to look down at it.

On the phones themselves, something pops up on the screen about the silence texting while driving but you have the option to keep it on or off. There shouldn't of been an option, once you're in the car you're officially at a no phone zone, put the phone down way in a place you can't hear it or see it and don't touch it until you get somewhere.

If you need a gps, there is one in the car and if not there is an app on the phone, and a holder to place your phone on your windshield. Then turn off notifications or like before turn on the silent feature for driving. No text is ever more important than your life and the people's lives around you. Phones can be a distraction just like everything else, you see an animal what are you going to do? Look at it. Driving without texting prevents a lot of things. With your phone in your hand you're capable of hitting signs, cars, people, buildings, etc. When you put your phone down you see the road and you see what is around you and you become so much more aware with your phone put away.

Driving takes a lot of effort, you have to know that you know what you're doing. You can't just get on a road and decide that this is the time to practice your turns, or your parking. Putting a phone in your hand is much worse when you haven't been driving long. Even grown adults still today don't know how to drive while on the phones so clearly practice doesn't even help with that. Each day you are on the road 9 people are killed and 1,000 injured due to texting and driving. There are 3,500 deaths each year due to texting, imagine if not all but most people sat down there phones how many people's lives would have been saved from paying more attention. There is guilt in each death that happens whether it's your fault while driving or the other person, you were in an accident and you feel like you did wrong even if you were doing everything right.

At the end of the day, it is illegal and police aren't necessarily doing everything they can to prevent it. They put this law into order so something could change but the people aren't changing so why aren't the police officers doing anything about it to help our and there safety. Whether you drive or you are a passenger make sure when you get into the car they text who they have to before they start driving around and if they go to reach fr tere phone don't be afraid to ask what they are doing. Tell them how you want your safety to be prevented and don't let them put your life in danger.         ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Phone, tablets, smart watches, and bluetooth headsets are attached to us. Most people have them with them in the car, at home, and on the go. But the biggest problem is using them in the car while driving. People that are behind the steering wheel, at no time, should be on their phone. It could make them lose their license, endanger other people, or even pay fines for using them.

On the road, drivers don't realize that there are cameras and police cars everywhere, even if they don't see them. Getting caught with a phone or any electronic device can get the average driver his or her license taken away for 6 months to three years. Most importantly, people who have CDLs (Commercial Driver's License), if they get caught using and electronic device, their license taken away. Commercial Drivers are usually big 18 wheelers or busses. If those drivers get their taken license taken away their whole livelihood is also taken away. When big commercial vehicles drivers get distracted on their phones they can lose control easily making it very dangerous for other drivers and even pedestrians.

In the US alone, 390,000 distracted driving injuries have occurred in one year. 1 out of every 4 car crashes are from distracted driving. Drivers might be texting, on social media, or even facetiming.

While traveling at 55 mph, the five seconds used to answer that text is the length of a football field. One hundred yards is enough time to run into a car or into a pedestrian. Even pedestrians are 4x less likely to obey crossing laws. No matter how fast you can text a lot can happen in a few seconds.

Studies have shown that 93.7% of cellphone owners admit to texting while driving (distracted driving). The average fine for distracted driving is $150-$250. The newest phone costs around one thousand dollars. That means, its just a minor inconvenience to pay the fine on electronic device that are attached to us. Maybe if fines were made steeper people would think twice before using their cell phones behind the wheel. Fines could be used for driver education, safer walks for pedestrians, and safer roads.

There're drivers that are always on their phones. Drivers that have lost their lives just because of picking up their phone. Don't pick that phone up, always look for people and cars, most definitely just be smart and just think twice.

However, it becomes a dangerous risks if someone want to decide check social media or any mobile applicant while operating a vehicle. Cell phone distracts are very high that why laws are put in place so that people have consequences for those that break laws put others in danger. Including the fact that 94 percent of drivers would support the ban to stop driving while texting and 74 percent support an ban on hand-held cell phone usage.

Laws such as Hand-held Cell Phone Use Ban, All Cell Phone Ban, and Text Messaging Ban are put in place to prevent crashes and a drivers distraction from the road. The Hand-held Cell Phone Use Ban is in 16 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands prohibit all drivers from using hand-held cell phones while driving. While the Text Messaging Ban is in 47 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands ban text messaging for all drivers with Missouri prohibits text messaging by novice or teen drivers. So States like Georgia, Louisiana, Washington, Oregon, and Maine have it were you will get fined $100-$500 for break these laws. But states Alaska and Utah can fine you $750-$10,000 or even one year of imprisonment.

Most of these laws are created and being enforced so that someone won't put their life or lives of others in danger.

In conclusion, cell phone shouldn't not be used while operating a vehicle. It could be very dangerous and lead to death so that's why laws are put into place.

There have been many stories of teens losing their life due to texting and driving causing grief from family but if teens choose to put the phone down while driving or text before they start the car there would have been less accidents in the united states,honestly i think drivers get distracted either way if they use the equipment for the phones or not because if they was to get a text or phone call they still gonna look off the road and possibly cause an accident,ways people could possibly stop this would be to lead by an example maybe if someone show other the proper way to drive they would want to drive good just takes one person to show others the right way.

Many people in the world today are distracted by a little screen called a cell phone. Some say they are dangerous while driving, have you ever thought of them being safe while driving? Having cell phones in a vehicle period can be safer, they do not have to be texting and driving. See, if you were to pick up the cell phone while driving, then of course it would be dangerous and put you at a higher risk. However, when you have a cell phone in the vehicle it can be used for navigation, emergencies, and for the parent's safety.

Imagine driving in the middle of nowhere and not having a clue of where you are going. That is where having a cell phone comes into place. You can use navigation on your device and it will give you a faster route and show you where you are going. It will also give you options on the nearest gas stations, places to eat, and resting places. With navigation, you are more likely to not get lost and it also gives you a destined time of arrival, along with faster routes.

Being safe in a vehicle is top priority, which is why having a cell phone can reduce the risks when there is an emergency. For instance, if there happens to be a car crash and someone is injured and if you have your cell phone then you can call for help. This can reduce the number of people getting injured and they can be sent to safety faster. Also, when you call for help and you happen to not know where you are, the police or whoever can track your phone and locate where you are and you will be able to receive, help. Even with this new technology, most cars have a method called ""hands-free"" and you are able to call, text, and navigate while keeping your hands on the steering wheel at all times. that is why Getting help quicker and easier is top priority for someone who just got into a car accident, and cell phones can make that happen, and how the hands-free method reduces these risks.

The last safety cell phones offer is the ability for a parent with children to know where they are at all times. Today with the new technology parents are able to track their kids with just one touch. If something were to happen to their child and the parent does not know where they are, they can track their phone and it tell them where they are. For example, there is an app called life three-sixty and this app allows the parents to see where their children are going, how fast they are going, if they run a red light, are speeding, etc. This app is very crucial when it come to a parent looking out for their kid. This app almost helps the parents because they feel a sense of comfort, knowing where their child is at.

Overall, having a phone in the vehicle while you are driving can be safe when it comes down to certain priorities. As long as you don't pick up the phone while driving, or go down to look at it. You are safe and put yourself at a lower risk. Things like having a GPS helps you navigate where you are, and can locate you for emergencies, as well as the parents feeling comforted knowing where their child is with one touch at their hands. Having a cellular device in a vehicle is safe, however it is up to you whether you want to put your life at risk when picking the phone up.                ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8
30B44E108321,"Americans in the world are using cell phones in every hour of their lives. Cell phones allow connection with the world. However, it is now considered more fashionable to carry a phone and less about what benefits cellphones actually offer. Cell phones offer multiple characteristics (in addition to communication) including cameras, TV games, texting, music, social media etc. As a result, because cell phones offer so much more other things to do besides communication, cell phones should not be used while driving.

Cell phones are a big distraction while driving. Drivers can easily lose focus on the road and switch lanes without noticing what they are doing because their eyes are not on the road. Therefore, it is not safe for to use cell phones while driving because kids will grow into teens and think it is cool to use their phones while driving because their parents did it. There have been more accidents with teens than ever before. Phones take your attention from the road and you can endanger citizens. The greatest disadvantage of using cell phones while driving is that it distracts away from the road.

In my state of Georgia, there is a new law called the hands-free-law. The hands free law says texting while driving is banned. Also, drivers cannot use hand held devices when driving. Therefore, drivers should not be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Since this law bans the hand-held usage of electronics devices while running a vehicle, drivers should use hands-free devices. Some hands-free device options include: blue-tooth devices and or GPS devices.

In closure, I believe that drivers should not use cell phones while driving. Using a hand-held device and driving isn't safe for the driver, other drivers, or even nearby civilians. Using a hand-held device takes more effort while driving than having a hands-free device. When driving, you should not have to multi- task. While driving you need to concentrate on the road. However, you cannot focus on the road if you're trying to use your phone at the same time.       ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

Driving while having a cellular device in the hand of anyone is a bad idea. It can cause someone, including yourself to lose your life, it can cost you, and it sets a bad example for children.

Using your phone while driving can cause yourself and others to lose your life. In the passage ""7 Reasons To Stop Texting And Driving. Is any text really more valuable than a life?"" by Gabi Levey it states how ""innocent people; young children, friends in your car, pedestrians, and fellow drivers, did absolutely nothing wrong and are forced to have their lives at risk solely due to a poor decision that you made""(2). Which means that one person's life can be taken away from them even though they have not done anything all because another person decides to pick up their phone. It also states in that same passage how the ""simple action of ""answering a quick text"" or even glancing at a text, means that you are selfishly putting other people's lives in danger""(Levey 2). Which also means that even one little answer to a text can cause someone to lose their life or almost lose their life because people want to be selfish and answer a message that can wait. Due to others wanting to be selfish can cause one or themselves to lose their life.

Another reason why people should not be able to use their phones while driving is because it could cost you. In the passage ""7 Reasons To Top Texting And Driving"" by Gabi Levey it states how ""fines and punishments for texting and driving range greatly depending on the state that you live in; for some states, the fine is merely $20, however, in others, it can be up to $500""(8). Which means that if someone were to get caught using their phone while driving, they would have to pay at least twenty dollars or even five hundred dollars for their fine. It also states in that same passage that ""if the action of texting and driving ends in injuring any other individuals, you can actually end up in jail, depending on the severity of the injury""(Levey 8). Which means that if someone were to get caught texting and driving will possibly go to jail. Any action that a person decides to do with their phone while driving will cost them.

The last reason why people should not text and drive is because it sets a bad example for children. In the passage ""7 Reasons To Top Texting And Driving"" by Gabi Levey it states how ""portraying to them that it is okay to text and drive is only going to lead to them making the mistake and risking their lives in the future""(7). Which means that if a person is texting while driving around that child then they're going to think it's ok so they are going to want to do it. It also says in that same passage that texting and driving ""portrays an awful example to them!

Children pick up on a lot more than we think they do""(Levey 7). In that case we should always set good examples around children due to the fact that they pick up on almost everything we do and we don't want for them to pick that up as a bad habit.

In conclusion, we as humans should not text and drive at all. We should be able to go at least thirty minutes without a cell phone. We should also realize that we are putting ourselves and others in danger, it can cost us, and it sets a bad example for children.

How many of you own a cell phone? And how many of you have used your cell phone while driving? The second we hear the ring of an incoming call or the beep of a text message, we instinctively reach for our phone to answer. But while driving, that may not be the wisest decision. For those of you that do not use your cell phone while driving, then I would like to thank you, because by resisting your phone, you could be saving a life. That is a powerful statement, but it is true.

Cell phone use while driving is dangerous. In Houston Texas, a father of five children veered of the road into the Green Bayou River. The father had his five children in the car when he veered off the road in the river. The reason for his reckless driving, he was distracted because he answered an incoming cell phone call. This tragic accident could've been prevented if the father had simply ignored his phone when it was ringing.

Accidents such as this are happening more frequently because people are talking and texting on their cell phones rather than paying attention to the road. To prevent our loved ones from becoming victims, like the five innocent children who lost their lives in Houston, we must support the banning of cell phone use in cars and make the choice to put down our own cell phones when we are driving. Better yet, let's turn them off when we get in the car and turn them back on when we arrive at our destination.

As you can see, driving while using a cell phone is unsafe and may result in serious and even deadly consequences. It is so dangerous that cell phone use in the car is compared to drunk driving or driving under the influence of drugs. If you think about it, in both situations the driver's awareness is altered. I am going to give you three reasons why cell phone use should be banned. The first reason why cell phone use should be banned is because it is very distracting. When we are talking on the phone or texting while driving, our attention is on our phone rather than the road. Secondly, this distraction had caused numerous car accidents that have resulted in deaths and seriously injured people. The third and final reason that cell phone use should be banned in cars is because cell phone users are reckless as drunk drivers. Since accidents are occurring more frequently, cell phone users are being compared to drunk drivers due to the recklessness of their driving and lack of awareness.

Isn't driving a vehicle without cellular devices distracting and stressful enough?? I can go ahead and explain why driving with a cell phone is not the right thing to do. It is also not the safest idea. Most of the world's population are using these devices while driving but don't realize, that to operate a vehicle it always takes two hands, at all times. So many things could go wrong at any time while driving even without these dangerous devices. No matter how far or how short of a distance you are traveling it does not make a difference.

The generation we are barely living through in todays society, these people don't think about anyone but their selves. During this process, you don't only place yourself in life or death situation, you are also harming others and even the people around others. Driving while operating an electronic device is more than illegal in my point of view. Once, a family member of mine suffered and literally died during a car crash and this entire situation never involved a cellular device. That shows there is no need to add another hazard behind the wheel. Especially around others.

Personally, the first step I take after entering a vehicle, is slapping that seatbelt on and placing my phone in my pocket after choosing music. Always do your personal process before you take the vehicle out of park. Cellular devices never became an issue until all of these smart phones were produced. The whole reason the government are making all of these newer, electronic, and way smarter is to prevent humans from using their cell phones while driving. One more thing to think about, is the larger the population grows, the more of this problem will grow and go on and on and on for generations.

In my opinion, I think all these people that are driving, and operating cell phones, are just not experienced enough to drive at all. If you have ever been in any kind of accident behind the wheel, you should know that the littlest mistake can make the biggest difference. The feeling after that, just the adrenaline shoots through the roof. Once these people have made those mistakes, they would learn the lesson that is waiting for them in the future. If your one of the people that drive while on your cell phone, then you need to rethink if you really want to risk your life. It will happen, sooner or later, driving while using a cell phone is not okay, so it will happen. Even to the best of us. Do not drive while operating a cellular device. It is against the law, and it may cause serious injury and possibly death.!             ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4
DBB077A0818A,"People shouldn't be able to use phone while they're driving, but at the same time people need their phone in case of an emergency. Or if their job requires using their phone and driving at the same time they'll have to use their phone.

Everyone knows the law that says that you can't use your phone while driving. Some of the reasons law enforcement say that is because they're plenty of incidents like car accidents or someone getting hit or running a red life. Those reasons could put your life or someone else's life at risk. If you need to use your phone, mostly for emergency purposes, you should pull over on the side of the road and their will me no lives at risk. Many people in the world, including teens, have been badly injured or killed from accidents because either them or the other driver were using their phone.

On the other hand some people in the world are going to have to use their phones as a job. For example, ubers and lyfts. People that do that as a job are going to have to use their phones to use their GPS to find the person that they are picking up from there location. But that goes for anybody that is traveling to places that they haven't heard of before or haven't been there in a while and forgot their ways on how to get there.

People should be able to use their phones while their driving, but at the same time they should not be able to use their phone at all. So what the law enforcements should do is that they should event some type of bumper sticker that people could put on their cars so that they should use their phone for certain purposes only. That should help the driving more safe at least. That should cause less accidents in the world. The only way to get those bumper stickers is that you have to have a job that requires you to use your phone. You're going to have to show proof that you are doing that job. Hopefully they will make this a law and the world will be a better place.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent,0.4

In 2018, 4,637 U.S citizens died because they or someone else were using their cell phones while operating a vehicle. Now imagine how many people died or have been injured within a decade. In my opinion people should not be allowed to use their cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. In my opinion these are three reasons you shouldn't text and drive while driving; It puts innocent lives at risk, you are more likely to crash, and is also very illegal to text and drive. I'm going to ask you three very important questions to make a compelling argument.

You would be surprised how many innocent people have died because the driver was on the phone. Answering a quick text or glancing at your phone your selfishly putting others in danger. According to the CDC, "" more than 3,000 people die every single day because of a distracted driver. That is a lot of people everyday that die because you want to answer a call or text someone. I personally think someone life's more important than my phone, my phone can wait.

Why text and drive if it's twice as likely you crash if you're driving while on the phone? Studies from Drivingtests. org show that those who text and drive are 23% more likely to be involved in a car accident. You are quite literally forcing yourself to pay the price for making the mistake of texting and driving. Crashing not only increases your car insurance, you also have to pay to fix your car. I feel like it's important to know that after you texting or on a phone call and get in a crash because it was your fault you will pay for a lot.

Last question I have for you is if you know it's illegal to text and drive for your safety why do it and put everyone around you in danger. If you get pulled over you could get a Monetary fine that can range from as low as 20-500 dollars. In some states texting while driving can result in criminal misdemeanor charges. If the offense has resulted in bodily injury to another driver Jail or Prison time is a possibility. If you hit someone and they die you are looking at 20 years and a fine of 250,000 and Yet again my question is why do it if you know it's illegal.

In conclusion to this I hope that you agree with me now based on the reasons I gave. Don't text and drive for you and others safety. I feel that those three reasons not to text and drive are the three most important reasons why not. What's sad to me about the three points I said that's common is that everyone knows who drives that these three things can happen to you.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Nowadays mobile devices like cell phones are in constant use everywhere on a daily basis. In recent time cell phones have become an important item to people, whether used for calendars, communication, organization, etc. But with the very helpful use of cell phones, they have become more of a distraction and potentially dangerous. Like the Samsung Galaxy note 7 exploding and lighting on fire, possible radiation from screens leaving marks on skin, and possibly the most dangerous driving while using cell phones. Its assumed that the majority of teen drivers are affected by this but some adults are too. Cell Phones have become a significant factor in car accidents.

SECTION HEADER

Despite the fact that there are laws against phone usage while driving, people still have their eyes away from the road without hesitation. Statistically, distracted driving caused 3,166 lives in 2017. Just about every state has issued a law or ban against cell phones while driving but it seems that there not very effective. Most have banned all use while driving but some have issued the hands free law. These offenses can lead to fines or a possible license suspension. Applying to all drivers but especially teen drivers. Mostly because teens already spend a lot of time with their phone but also they understand most of the technology and features of their smartphone. It's baffling that with these laws placed people don't abide by them.

CONCLUSION

Some vehicles even have features to increase the effect of the hands free law. Being able to answer calls just from a press of a button on the steering wheel, voice text message replies, even the use of Siri or ""Ok Google"" stops hands from reaching the phone. It's extremely useful but not used enough. More action needs to take place to stop any occurrence. Not only should people preemptively be more cautious of the road but should also follow the law. Officers should be more alert and punishments should be more harsh to be able to make a big statement to save lives. If people are on their phones so much they should know and see that these laws are in effect but most people have that "" If it's not me why should i care"" mindset. They don't understand it until it happens to them when it's already too late.

Some people might say i just picked up my phone to check but even for that split second something bad could happen.

Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. Answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field. People think that it's not that much of danger when you just check a text but they fail to realize that they are driving on the road with other people that might not know how to drive that good there could be up coming traffic and they wouldn't know because there eyes are not on the road.

I believe that drivers could use their phones only at stop lights or anything that they have to stop for. I feel like there is no text that is important you have to risk your life for i see no problem with being on the phone actually talking because you can use a speaker on your phone you can actually communicate with your eyes on the road. If someone is texting you there are many stops and breaks in driving you could wait a little bit before pulling out your phone.

Majority of the age of people that are getting in theses accidents are teenagers. Teenagers feel like there phones are everything they can't go without looking or using them for a long period of time which tempts them to eventually pick it up and check it.

Cell phone use while driving is one of those hot-button issues at the moment. Everyone has a cell phone. When notifications sound, kids my age and many adults have now been conditioned to immediately engage. Our engrained Pavlov's dog reaction doesn't stop just because we are at the wheel.. Whether it is a message, social media or a phone call, curiosity gets the better of them and they feel they have to look now. Using cell phones while driving should be banned completely for the safety of everyone on the road. It doesn't matter how good you are at multitasking. It should be forbidden and against the law entirely. Here are a few reasons for that.

Let's start with texts, social media, and any other alert. To stop and read this alert you would have to take your eyes off the road for longer than the recommended time of one second, it takes to check the rear-view mirror. It is extremely dangerous to text or read while driving. It is a hazard to everyone on the road, so it is not just your life you are risking. We endanger every one of our passengers and anybody we are sharing the road with.

As for making phone calls, this to should be banned. I do understand that sometimes your spouse may call needing you to stop somewhere on the way home, or you think it may be an emergency. If that is the case just pull over to the side of the road, take the call, then return to driving. If the call can wait, return it later. If it can't wait, you can always stop briefly. There should be no reason for you to pick up your phone while you're driving.

Whatever it is can almost certainly wait until you get where you're going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many lives to tweets or texts if people are under the threat of losing their license, steep fines, or if they truly think about the potential consequences. I don't think I've ever liked one post or seen one funny meme that could replace the loss of a friend or loved one.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent,0.6

Drivers should not be able to have the use of a cellphone while conducting a vehicle. People die every day in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. Each year over 330,000 accidents happen due to being distracted over a phone. Studies show that a cell phone puts drivers at a four time greater risk. Although many people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences and studies showing that the use of a cell phone while conducting a vehicle is dangerous and people should avoid using them while driving.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road, which makes it easy to forget that everyone else shares the roads as well. Many cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. This is what leads to fatal accidents. People may think they can multitask while conducting a vehicle and using their cellular devices but in reality that is not the case. Studies show that no matter how concentrated you may think you are, you cause an accident. Whether it's you hitting something small, making others get into an accident, or yourself hitting another car.

Hands-free phones are just as disturbing as holding a phone. They both serve the same purpose when it comes to distracting the driver from the road. Although hands-free devices do not increase safety, but causes the same amount of distraction as if one were holding a phone. They both serve the same purpose when it comes to distracting the driver from paying attention to the road. Studies show that the reaction time significantly reduces when paying attention to a phone rather than the road for an aged person. Now imagine how much more this affects an elderly person.

Many drivers keep their cell phones in their vehicles. However, when it rings, they are not going to ignore it because of how tempted they will be to reach for it. Therefore, they lose all concentration while driving, and all the focus is on the phone. Many States have rightfully stopped local governments from prohibiting cell phone use while conducting a vehicle due to many fatal accidents. Many people continue to do it and not follow the law. In addition, for those people are who to blame for when someone innocent loses their life because of someone else being distracted over their phone.

Not only should cellular devices be prohibited completely but, the law as well should be changed to not having a device at all while conducting a vehicle. This will prevent many accidents as well as saving many lives. Many people already do not follow the law and maybe never will. Only way they will actually respect the law is if an accidents happens to them or they get caught not obeying the law. Therefore, people should be restricted from using cellular devices while conducting a vehicle. No one wants to go through a terrible accident nor be the reason for a fatality.                           ",5,Phones and driving,Independent,0.8

Today, we use our cell phones for just about anything and everything to include; texting, talking to our loved ones, and connecting with the rest of the world via social media. Cell phones have become a natural way of life to where we pick up our phones and use them like second nature. However, the dangers present themselves when we get behind the wheel of a car and carry these habits of cell phone addictions with us. If all states ban the use of cell phones while driving, then there would be a reduced amount of fatalities each year.

When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road which makes it easy to forget that the roads are shared by everyone and not for your exclusive use. Other drivers on the road take notice of drivers on their cell phones whether they want to or not because of the hazards they create. Erratic driving is something that we all get quite worked up about, especially if it makes us late or is otherwise a direct inconvenience to us.

First of all, by using the cell phone while driving, the driver will experience visual distraction which takes the driver 's eyes off the road onto the cell phone. Secondly, the driver will experience a physical distraction by having to release the steering wheel to attend to the cell phone.

Or if there is a family emergency then yes you should use your phone. If it isn't one of those occasions, then you should not use your phone in a vehicle at all.

Lastly allot of people listen to music through their phone while driving. Changing your song should not be an excuse. This is because it still takes away your attention from the road to pick the song you want. Before you start driving you should pick a song and just let the rest shuffle and put your phone down. If caught on your phone while driving, you should be fined depending on the setting you are in.

An sort good option would be to use speaker phone. However, this option is not completely hands free, as it requires the driver to either make an call or answer one.
