Throughout the years people have lost their lives due to the use of their cellular phones. Using phones while driving could be dangerous for everyone that's on the road 24/7. Innocent people that go to work a drive every day put their lives at risk for other people that drive while using their phones. Phones should not be used while driving.

People that use their phones while driving put their lives at risk for the simple fact that they could cause an accident on the highway or even in the streets. People choose the wrong moment while driving to look at their phones and sometimes forget that they share the road with other innocent people and they turn what could simply be a normal day to a tragic ending on a person's life. Phones haven't been out for that long and we as humans can get so distracted by just looking down at your phone and not being aware of the cars around you or in front of you. Every year more people die for causing an accident while using their phone or is killed by a person thats on their phone when not supposed to.

In the U.S., 4637 people died in car crashes in 2018 due to cell phone use. Including the cost of people's lives, these crashes were responsible for $129 billion dollars. The national safety council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 millions crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving , these mortality death rates are from every country that people are able to have a phone. One out of four cars accidents in the united states is caused by texting and driving. however , the sad reality is that there are 3,287 deaths each day due to fatal car accidents. On average, 9 of these daily fatalities are related to people that are distracted by their phones while driving.

Ways that we can prevent accidents of people using their phones while driving is that people should put their phone on silent or out of reach. People should be able to use their phone if they are going to a certain location and they need to use their GPS. car accidents are mostly caused by the fact that nowadays teenagers have the privilege of driving around with innocent people that go to work to bring food to the table. Most teenagers know the risks that their lives could be at risk while driving. According to a AAA poll, 94% of teen drivers acknowledge the dangers of texting and driving, but 35% admitted to doing it anyways. 21 percent of teen drivers involved in fatal accident were distracted by their cell phones.

I say don't think it is smart to be on your phone while driving because it can cause accidents. There are 1.6 million car crashes a year because people are driving with their phones out. If more people put down their phones then they can know what's going on around them to slow the death rate down. There are 10 percent of teens that die in car crashes because they are on their phones. they are distracted by the internet or people texting them more then there life.

If you need a phone for a gps because you don't know where to go then you can use the audio. It will be safer that way because you wont need to keep looking down at your phone or have the passenger help you if you are driving with someone else. Your life means more then a text that can end it all for you or someone else.    ",2,Phones and driving,Independent
4F0E197053FF,"Drivers Should Be Limited As To When They Can Use Their Phones While Driving

Drivers who are distracted by their phone while driving have an increased risk of crashing. Crashes affect both the crasher and any possible crashing victims. Everything from physical pain to emotional pain as well as financial pain can be felt after a crash. 3,287 deaths happen every day due to fatal car crashes. On average, 9 of these fatalities are related to distracted driving. Due to the inability to test if a crash was due to distracted driving, it is believed that the recorded number of distracted driving incidents is greatly under-recorded.

Over 80% of drivers admit to not paying attention to the road while they are doing blatantly hazardous behaviors while driving. The listed activities are not always the driver interacting with their phone, however it is safe to assume that interacting with their phone is one of the many hazardous activities these drivers admitted to doing. Distracted driving is now considered to be the ""new drunk driving"" since it follows the same psychological pattern. With recent studies of phone addiction showing some of the same signs as drug addiction, people are having a harder time ignoring their phone. It is no coincidence that car crashes are the number one killer of teens in the U.s and that 16-19 year olds have a three times higher chance to be involved in a fatal crash than any other age group while studies show that teens and younger children are the most addicted to their phones.

While it is dangerous to be interacting with your phone while driving some people have no choice in the matter. Reasons for this can range from work related texts or phone calls to family matters. Some states are trying what is called a ""hands free law"" that makes it illegal for a driver to hold their phone while they are driving. It also states that a driver cannot read or watch videos on their phone while driving. Because of this law there have been multiple accessories made that allow drivers to mount their phones in their car so that they can send voice messages or speech to text messages. The law along with the accessories allow these types of drivers to access their phones, though very limited, and keep up to date with their important concerns.

The hands free law and the accessories could make the open roads a little safer for everybody while allowing people to keep their phones in their car but it is important to remember that no matter how many laws are put into place, people will still continue to abuse them and accadences will still happen. It comes down to the individual and how properly educated they are and whether or not they can mentaly handle a responsibility like driving.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Look around you! All you see is people from all ages staring at a device all day which is a phone. People are always stuck on their phones, that it seems they can never let it go while:working ,at school,cleaning,and driving. Some things caused by using your phone while driving are car accidents, irresponsible people driving, or you can get a fee.

Phones can be such a distraction to everyone at anytime including while driving which is a safety hazard. A major cause of deaths in the US is motor vehicle accidents because of phone usage most of the time. ""About 33,700 people die in motor vehicle each year"" shown on CDC. This means that some of the accidents are from phone usage and other factors, but if people stop using their phones while driving their could be less accidents in the future. In the article ""Mobile phones and driving safety"", it stated that,""In a 2011 study it was reported that over 90% of college students surveyed texts (initiate,reply,or read) while driving."" It proves that even adults can be immature that they use their phones while driving even when knowing the possible consequences they may have. If people continue to use phones while driving then the rate of death will get higher and people would think that nothing will happen to them while using their phones.

Many people may say that teens are the ones driving irresponsibly by using their phones when operating a vehicle. In reality, everyone from every age is irresponsibly driving. According to an article of "" Teen driver source"", ""In 2015, 42 percent of high school students who drove in the past 30 days reported sending a text or email while driving.""The other half were most likely adults in which adults should set younger people an influence because they learn from them. In another passage on ""Science Daily' stated that, adults are always on their phone while driving with young kids either by sending a text, reading texts, on social media, or their just distracted driving. I believe that the adults should be more cautious including the teens but adults tend to have younger kids with them in the car.

Both the adults and teens are guilty of driving on their phones, but they should learn sooner to avoid any type of tragedy.

Each state in the US has their own laws to protect their people. Since some don't listen the people in charge of the state they've made laws for people who drive careless. About 43 states have prohibited drivers to text or even be on their phones (Facts & Statistics about texting and driving). Even though not all states have been prohibited of being on their phones, almost all of them have which is a good difference. In some states if the police stops you for the first time for texting and driving, you can get a fee depending where you live. For example, Georgia has a fee of $150, Florida has one of $30,and New Jersey has one of $400. The fee law is a good option because if they stop you a second time then you could have jail time if you didn't learn the first time from the fee. If the US keeps making stricter laws of being on the phone while driving then the people will learn.

In conclusion, driving while using your phone at any age isn't right. By one simple distraction something tragic could occur. It's not always teens driving reckless, but if anyone act young by not responsibly driving then they could get a fee they have to pay. Driving while using the phone should be taken more serious to prevent any issues.       ",6,Phones and driving,Independent

Most humans have that habit of attending to their phone when they receive a notification while driving. They are so anxious to know what's going on right there at that moment. But they have no idea of how much danger they are putting themselves & others in! Using a phone while driving can wait. Here's why!

First, you can't multitask & pay attention to both a phone & the road at the same time. If you can't pay attention to the road, you're not aware of what is coming at you, your surroundings, potholes on the road & pedestrians! Driving is not only about you valuing your safety but also others & avoiding mishaps.

Second, you could enter other lanes just by slanting the steering wheel a little without knowing it! So therefore, you're putting others at risk because you're not concentrating on the positioning of your vehicle which could lead to crashing into something whether it is another vehicle, pedestrian or object. You could also damage your car by hitting curbs or potholes in the street which could also result in a flat tire or the car needing a new wheel alignment, something like that.

Lastly, it is proven that using a phone while operating a vehicle is a high risk. Cellular devices are involved in approximately 1.6 million auto accidents causing nearly 500,000 injuries and 6,000 deaths annually. Using a device & driving maybe more dangerous than driving under the influence. Just think about it.

Those are my reasonings for advocating that phones shouldn't be used while operating a vehicle. It's a high risk & dangerous. But hey, it's just my opinion!   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Losing your life over having a cellphone in your hand or trying to respond to a text that can wait is not worth your life. It is not that serious to ruin someone else's life and yours to send a text back to your homeboy saying your on the way. Stop signs maybe but while driving of course not.

Using your cell phone on the road is nothing to play with. Driving without a phone in your hand is hard enough. You have to focus on your surroundings and other people driving is hard enough. I think I can speak for everyone when I say stuff can happen right before your eyes. That means as soon as you look down to send a text back to your girlfriend you can be in a ditch or through a building as soon as you look up. I feel like there should be more technology that can help people use their devices on the go. But the way it is looking now in the world it does not need to be addressed at this moment.

Moving on, I feel like people should not be able to have their phones active while driving. And music should not be played loud enough to where they can't hear the outside world. Personally I don't like how people do that. It is dangerous to others and themselves. But more phone laws should be introduced because that is way too many deaths to be comfortable with. I don't want to be known at my funeral for being killed all because I was texting a friend.

InConclusion, phone laws are looked over in the country today. If we want to cut down on these deaths we need to take action on the little issues that are called cell phones.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent

In my opinion, while you are driving you should not be able to use your phone. You are putting your life in danger as well as others. Phones are a big distraction while driving and if you don't have some type of bluetooth system in your car then you should not be on it. Cell phones are the leading factors that cause accidents. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands.

Holding a cell phone to your ear, or having your eyes diverted from the road by logic and common sense the driver is distracted. If an emergency maneuver or emergency braking is needed a driver has a second to react, and a split second to execute the appropriate maneuver to avoid a collision. Picture doing this with a cell phone in your hand. Those who are caught will be issued a ticket by a police officer who will probably be quite perturbed at the driver's ignorance and poor decision after witnessing the devastating effects of texting and driving at accident. A text message that reads ""ok"" isn't worth a couple hundred dollar fine.

However, people shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is OnStar. OnStar is a service that in case of accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while On Star is always prepare to help you in an accident.

In the society of today, everyone is easily distracted when they get a notification on their phones. Which can lead to some funny stuff like running into a pole or a wall. But it can also lead to the end of someone's life.

The average person drives 70 mph on the highway, and if a person were to look away for 5 seconds they would have traveled 102.7 feet. That is more than a quarter of a football field. By that time anything could've happened that would lead them to an accident. Each year, over 390,000 accidents caused by texting and driving leads to severe injuries such as broken bones, neck and back injuries, traumatic brain injuries, etc. For example, in 2013 a 22 year-old man named Alexander Heit flipped his car and rolled for a while. He died while typing a text to his friend.

Because of all the deaths and injuries caused by texting while driving, most states in the United States have made laws to try to make the road a safer place. The first offense you will be charged with a misdemeanor and can get a ticket that ranges from $25 to $50 and one on their driver license. And it just gets worse from there on out if they continue violating the law. But if you were to kill someone while texting and driving, you will be charged with vehicular homicide or manslaughter and can spend up to 20 years in prison. Although all of these precautions have been made, accidents are still growing.

The states of Missouri and Montana do not have laws to regulate texting while driving even after all of the accidents caused by it. I honestly think that there should be harsher laws for people texting while driving. It so saddening to hear that someone lost their life over a text that could have waited till later. Something needs to happen so that all of these deaths stop.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

It distracts you from paying attention to your surroundings and you could hurt yourself or others around you. It is also against the law.

The U.S department of transportation reported that cell phones are involved in 1.6 million vehicle crashes each year. It has caused half a million injuries and around 6000 deaths annually. Texting while driving is even more dangerous than driving while under the influence of alcohol. People should put their devices down and focus on the roads and surrounding cars.

Everyday around 11 teens die in crashes caused by texting and driving. It only takes 3 seconds for a crash to occur after a driver becomes distracted by their cell phone or anything else. Holding a device while driving slows their reaction time by 49%. Car wrecks have killed nearly 32,999 people yearly and injuring around 2,239,000 people.

As of July 1,2018, in Georgia the ""hands free law"" was passed. The ""hands free law"" means that drivers will no longer be allowed to have a phone in their hand or supported by any part of their body. Texting while driving is highly illegal and it's good to see the state's law being put in to action.

We should not text and drive. It is overall a distraction and could lead you to death or you could kill an innocent person. The laws are very strict about texting and driving now.

DB48F47BB981,"A large majority of the population has a smart phone or some other devise like it. A lot of these people think they cannot live without their phone being on their person. This causes people to be distracted while driving, and causing crashes. They do have other things they can use like the hands free in their cars. They also have the very high possibility of being pulled over and given a ticket by police. All these are more than enough reason to stop driving with a phone.

In America 28% of the crashes happen because of a phone using distracted driver. This is freighting to me because all it takes is one person on their phone to crash into someone else and possibly take their life. This is a danger to anyone and their vehicle on the roadways making people unconfident while driving. Motorcyclist also have an even greater danger as they are harder to see even for non-distracted drivers so the danger is multiplied.

In 2019 most cars on the road have a hands-free devise built in to the car. This helps many people not use their phone and keep his or her eyes on the road. A lot of people that text and drive may not even know such a thing exists, but if they use this then they will greatly reduce the chance of a fatal crash.

A lot of states now have laws against having your phone in your hand while driving at all now. You will run the risk of getting pulled over and receiving a ticket with a large fine from them. I am glade that they do this as it makes people think twice before picking up their phone for an unnecessary text and causing an accident. People need to realize that other people's lives are not less important than their phones.

In conclusion I believe that people should not be able to use their phones in the car. Using the phone can cause you to be distracted and lose control of your car. There are safer ways of going about this like use the cars hands-free systems. And finally the fact that you could be given a ticket should make you think twice before using your phone.

I think that people should be able to use their phones while driving even though it's dangerous. If that person is responsible and can pay attention while driving and looking at their phone once in a while then it should be fine.

Phones are a key part of our life, we use it for everything we need but some people can't be away from their phone for a minute and that can be a problem if there driving people. They could get in a car cash a severely injure someone and also put there life at risk or maybe even kill someone. As long as that person is responsible and can pay attention to the road while on their phone it shouldn't be a problem.

What if there's something really important that you need to handle on your phone and your on the road you can drive and handle your business at the same time instead of waiting until later where you might forget about it later and what if you get a phone call or a text from someone and its important and you can't answer or text them later.

These are some of the reasons I think people should be allowed to you use their phones while driving and some of the reasons and risk of using your phone while driving. I don't think it should be illegal because that's too much because you never know what people got going on these days.

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because it is so dangerous. Driving while using a cell phone could cause many accidents and maybe others on the road lives. Using cell phones while driving is illegal but everyone does it and it could cause problems..

Driving while using cell phones is known all over the world. There are no less than 75 percent of drivers nominated not only ignoring mobile phones rules while driving but texting as well. People using their phones an any case could cause themselves in trouble, harmed, or probably dead.

The reason why people are using their phones while driving because of the psychological aspect. Not only adults doing it also teenagers are driving and using their cellphones and driving too. The young adults had got to the point that they have to respond back to a text or a call, that they need to learn that a long-awaited response from a text or call does not mean rejection all of the time.

My opinion is that they should not be able to use cell phones in any situation while operating a vehicle. I think this for multiple reasons such as they can get into an accident, they could harm someone else, and they could easily take a life out of this world.

My first reason why I think they should not be allowed to use cell phones is because it could lead to a car accident with someone else. For example, on the News 24 website the driving states this, """"I was trying to get my phone on the bed behind me. It was ringing. I did this while I was driving. I'm sorry about this I should have stopped the truck."" This shows that many people don't think about their surroundings within the reality and rather have their phones.

My second reason why is because they could harm someone else. It is proven that nearly 390,00 injuries happen during accidents that involve the use of cell phones. For example, an article on livestrong. com states , ""traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for American teens, and when it comes to distracted driving, young people are among the most likely to text and talk behind the wheel."" This proves that many accidents harm other people when the collision happens or within the next few days after the collision.

While some may say they need it for if their family is having an emergency and they had to make a quick phone call, you should still need to think about others and your surroundings and not just yourself.

Today, many states within the United States are making it a law to drive with a phone in your hand and can take you to court and write you a ticket for driving with a phone in your hand.

Driving in itself is already dangerous and risky but then you put the additional risk of unneeded distractions it makes it more dangerous.

3,637 people died in 2018 alone because of phone related accidents.

Believe it or not this is one of the lowest recorded numbers in recent history. The National Safety council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. 1 out of 4 crashes in the United States is caused by texting and driving.

DE01C3FDCA0A,"Driving while operating your phone can end in a very horrific way and has for a number of young adults. The number one killer of young adults is motor vehicle crashes. This is a major issue in the United States and it is shown because a law was made to prevent operating a phone and driving. For example, there are billboards everywhere saying no texting and driving and commercials saying the same. Texting and driving may seem tempting to do, but every year thousands of drivers and passengers are killed due to someone being on their phone and driving. It only takes a couple of seconds for you to take your eyes off the road and someone can swerve in your lane or you swerve in someone else's lane and didn't notice because you are texting someone back or looking at a notification. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving because in a matter of seconds you, your family or someone else's life could be put in danger or worse, taken away.

First, ask yourself if the text or notification you received is more important than your life or than the people on the road with you. If not, put down the phone and wait until you are at a light or until you get to your destination. No notifications are worth someone's life or yours. You can look at the news or on the internet and see just how many young adults' lives are cut short because they wanted to text someone back or make a snap, all of that can wait. Seeing the statistics, the death rates, even some people's friends dead because they couldn't wait to text someone back or make a snap. Just because you got away with it once doesn't mean you should keep trying to do it because all it takes is a couple seconds and then you or someone else is hurt or dead.

Secondly, ""In 2018 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was involved in 2,841 motor vehicle crash fatalities. Among those killed: 1,730 drivers, 605 passengers, 400 pedestrians and 77 bicyclists."" All these deaths could have been avoided if the person could have just waited until they stopped or until they got to their destination. Your parents tell you to text or call before you start driving for a reason so they won't lose their child or see their child hurt. ""Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent."" So this shows that texting can make you forget important things you are supposed to do before or while driving.

Lastly, ""Typing text messages reduces a driver's ability to adequately direct attention to the roadway, to respond to important traffic events, and to control a vehicle within a lane and with respect to other vehicles."" This shows that the couple of seconds you take to text or look at your phone can take away the attention you are required to have on the road to ensure safety. Texting while driving could make you miss that there is construction going on, someone is walking, or etc. Parents should not call while their children are driving, they should call before or after they arrive at their destination. If their child is called he is going to look at their phone and some might answer, but all it could take is a look and boom the car goes into another lane or they hit someone or another car.

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving because in a matter of seconds you, your family or someone else's life could be put in danger or worse, taken away. No notification is worth someone's life. You can easily take someone's life young or old by a simple text. Before you start driving, call and text everyone that needs to be called or texted and if they call or text wait until you stop or get to your destination.

Should people have the privilege and/or the right to be able to have their phone out inside the car? While there are some good reasons why you should have the right, there are some things that people just can't help.

We already can't stop all the people that use their phones while they drive and now a days more and more people are getting addicted to their phones almost making it impossible to put down even while just having a simple dinner let alone putting it down while there driving most people don't even realize that there even doing it and most care now a days have the Bluetooth or people sell Bluetooth devices so you can be on call and drive while you drive making it better for the people but as tested on ""MythBusters"" changes a little but still distracts you in some sort of way people also know there way around things already and sometimes work or no most of the times it works but some of the times it doesn't under a code of law because there are not enough laws in places or ""fine print"" and they can just say oh well it's like a Bluetooth but it wasn't type of stuff and the court can't do anything about it.

This is what I think about the phones calls and driving is may not be clear cause there really is no answer to this question for me personally I don't care what they do or say all I care about is if our people our safe there really is no reason for people to be not allowed to have there phones in a car or make calls or answer them maybe there should a cam in every car that shows whenever your texting and driving or have your phone up against your ear just so if the other person that gets hit they have the cam to see if there were texting or on a call whenever you are driving and get into accident (hopefully no) but still you would have the prove that they were on it meaning the phone or not.

They (cops) think they can just lie as well but with that cam they can't lie, or anything even know they shouldn't even if it's an exsaturration it still means something in the court of law it could either mean good or bad for the person testifying what they did or didn't do and with that cam there is no more lying anymore and takes away more problems like for example who/what happened before the crash how many people were really in the car and finally how they got hit and out of the car if camera is in correct placement in every car sadly they all have to be in different placement in each variety of car.

This is what I think and what people should do about cars and phones the true ones would understand this message thank you so much for taking your time to read till again bye.   ",2,Phones and driving,Independent
B8EB9AC4606F,"Cell phones have become very popular. Almost everyone who is old enough to drive owns a cell phone. They have become a part of life. Cell phones are an asset this day and time, but they can also be very dangerous. Although cell phones are a necessity, I do not think they should be used while driving.

Drivers should not be able to use cell phones while driving. You shouldn't be on your phone while driving. It causes all types of tragic deaths. The best way to stop it is to enforce the no use law. People die almost every day from this. When you drive and text it causes accidents and deaths. People have a hard time with texting and driving. They just have to pick up the phone that instant. To me, I fill like electronics are evil to humans because since they dropped the first phone the death rates has increase.

Using your phone and driving is just like drinking and driving. I saw my mother actually texting and driving and she slam on brakes. It was very scary at the moment because we were young. People just love to do that. I'm not going to lie if the phone call is important to me, I am going to answer it, but I will try to pull off of the road first. I do not want to cause an accident and hurt myself or someone else just to answer a call or text. That can wait.

Using cell phones while driving put everyone's life in danger. We don't know what the person behind the wheel is going through. There is nothing so important it can't wait. Next time you get that phone call or text while driving, wait until you stop the car to answer it. You could save your life or the life of someone else.        ",4,Phones and driving,Independent
47185B1F5C2A,"In the world we live in, everyone has a cell phone. Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. They should not because it is a distraction, and the call or text can wait.

The call or text can wait because you have to take your eyes off the road to answer or reply. Many times when you're texting and driving you misspell words and then you have to go back and correct it. So therefore when you go back and correct it your eyes are still off the road. This also means you are risking your life and someone else's life by being on the phone . In addition this leads to my next reason.

Cell phones are a distraction. They are a distraction because if you get a notification you're going to look for your phone. You can look down for 1 second and anything can happen. Also when people talk on the phone they are distracted. They have a tendency to look ways that they aren't supposed to and they drive crazy.

In conclusion drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones while driving. It is a distraction and the call or text can wait. Remember when you drive you have to drive for yourself and drive for others too. So try to avoid texting or answering and call while driving especially if it's just a friend.

5E538C8612E2,"In today's world there are many people that text and drive or talk on the phone and drive at the same time, but should those people even do that? Texting and driving is just as dangerous as drinking and driving. In my opinion I don't think people should text and drive because it can cause many dangerous scenarios. Approximately 9 people are killed and over 1,000 people are injured every day in the United States due to people texting and driving. During the daylight hours an average of 660,000 people are using electronic devices while driving. People from ages 16-24 are mostly involved in car accidents having to do with texting and driving.

When you text and drive you put not only your life at risk, but others around the environment as well because you take your eyes off the road and are not paying attention. The average person focuses their attention away from the road for about 4.6 seconds. Also when you talk on the phone your reaction time is the same as if you are under the influence of alcohol. In addition, if you get caught texting and driving your license can get suspended and or get penalty points.

Texting and driving can be very dangerous because you have to look at your phone and your eyes are not paying attention to the road, and since your eyes are off the road you can end up hitting another car, and or end up causing a death. When you text and drive you are distracted and are not paying attention to your surroundings. When you're not paying attention to the road and your surroundings you are not aware of what's around you, objects such as humans, animals, walls or any other objects that can cause you to get hurt. This is a big reason why texting and driving is bad and also illegal.

Additionally, when you crash your car because of texting and driving the car insurance is very expensive, and if your insurance company finds out that you wrecked your car from texting and driving your car insurance will be even more expensive. So if you don't want to pay a lot more money for a car wreck don't text and drive. Furthermore, monetary fines for texting and driving can range from $20-$500 depending on which state you are in. also you can get criminal misdemeanor charges in class B or class C. or if you injure or kill someone, jail time may be imposed.

In conclusion, texting and driving does not need to occur. do not do anything else in your car besides paying attention to the road and having both of your hands on the steering wheel. People around the world need to realize how much danger you are putting yourself and others around you in. too many people di because others are too worried about their phones instead of the people around them.

DFADF4684C43,"The Dangers of Driving with a Phone

On a daily basis the majority of humans own and utilize cell phones. The use of a cell phone while driving can lead to injuring yourself; injuring others on the road; and having a record in the system. Drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones while driving a vehicle.

Drivers are risking their lives when they decide to utilize their cell phones while driving. The cell phone is a form of distraction that can cause an accident. An article points out ""Failing to keep a proper lookout and to pay attention to surrounding dangers because of distractions caused by the cell phone"" (Warner and Sherman para. 4). Giving your phone a quick glance can result in an accident. Therefore, it's important to always keep your eyes on the road while driving.

People are not only risking themselves but others on the road as well; when they decide to use their cell phones. Talking or texting while driving is life threatening; that being the case it's essential not to try to multitask while driving a vehicle. When a driver is not being continuously attentive while driving; it can cause an accident. If they crash into another car; they're putting others life in danger. People need to be considerate of the other drivers on the road; so they need to be focused on their surroundings when driving.

Although, no state bans all cell phone use for all drivers. If you were to get in an accident because you were using a cell phone there would be consequences to the one at fault. If an accident were to occur you're more likely to face jail time; especially if it resulted in the other driver getting injured. Being in this situation can result in having a record in the system. A way to avoid this from occurring you would have to consider to put your cell phone on 'Do not disturb'.

At the end of the day it's a choice to decide whether or not you're going to utilize a cell phone while driving. Humans need to be cautious because their actions can affect others immensely.

Losing the privilege to drive can be upsetting, all the work that's put in just to get the privilege to drive. Driving is a privilege that we earn and lose, this essay discusses the ways to lose and keep the privilege to drive. There are multiple ways to lose the privilege of driving but one way is by using a electronic device while behind the wheel. Most people believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones,texting,etc. while operating a vehicle.

Driving while talking on the phone can get others and the driver hurt. One example could be hydroplaning. Hydroplaning is caused by traction and sliding on a film of water. Using one hand for driving and the other hand for the phone while it's raining is a creation of an accident and getting the privilege to drive taken away. Your driving privileges would be taken away because the driver has a phone in their hand and it's not allowed to have a phone in the vision of the driver behind the wheel.

Another example would be of course texting and driving because once again there is a phone in the hand of the driver instead of both hands on the wheel and no one paying attention to the road. This could lead to an accident because many drivers don't know where they're going and the car could lose control. Driving with a device in your hand is a distraction because your attention should be focusing on your surroundings and the vehicles on the road.

To keep from getting hurt and jeopardizing your life and the life of others,drivers should follow the Hands Free Law. The Hands Free Law is a proposed driving law that states that a driver shall not ""record or broadcast a video"" on any mobile phones, iPads, computers or touching any part of their bodies while operating a vehicle. Even with the Hands Free technology, drivers are not allowed to write, read, or send any messages or emails, but voice to text is allowed. Voice to text is a form of speech synthesis that converts text into spoken voice output or when the speaker can speak into their device and it translates their words into a text so that the speaker is able to answer the text message or any other important subject.

Driving is a privilege. Responsible drivers should always pay attention to the road and other drivers. Cell phones should always be out of the drivers hand so they may maneuver the steering wheel and not drive reckless. Drivers need to remember that driving is a privilege and that it can easily be taken away from you.       ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

There are pros and cons to using cell phones while driving, also depending how you use them. But if I had to choose in between the two, cell phones should not be used while operating a vehicle unless there's an emergency, and here's why.

Accidents happen every day and it is very rare at times, that people make it out alive. People are dying almost every day from car accidents because of cell phones. About 30 percent of accidents involve talking, texting on cell phones. That should send a message to people saying, "" Hey, stop texting and driving"". When you decide to use your phone and drive, you've basically just decided to put not just you, but someone else's life at risk.

Take consideration in your passengers, pedestrians, and other people's operating a vehicle life. It does not take long to pull over or park your car to take care of whatever was so important that u had to put other lives in danger and pull your cell phone out. You need to really think about what's really important when your want to pull your phone out. And let's not just skip over the fact that is illegal. Being pulled over or caught on your phone while driving can affect you, negatively.

With driving and using your phone being against the law, if you are caught, you will get an automatic fixed penalty notice, three penalty points, and a fine. And if your license gets suspended and you continue to drive, it's an additional 6 months. So slow down and really ask yourself is this worth picking up the phone right away to text your boyfriend/girlfriend back. Is this really this time to call friends and make plans? I would say it's a lot to think about but it's not. Just do the right thing.

Imagine not making it back home to your loved ones. Imagine what you could cause and put other people through that they didn't deserve, because they were doing the right thing. Or put yourself in their shoes. Just think about it before you decide to pull your phone out and possibly cause accidents maybe death. We can prevent things happening like that if we just do the right thing. Is the cell phone worth it? That's a decision for you to make.

Primarily involving teens who are so distracted by their phones that they are not paying any attention to the road. With the growing number of car accidents happening, they have put into place the hands-free law so that it is now illegal to be on your phone while operating a vehicle.

If you are driving while driving a vehicle, there is no good excuse for using your phone because anything that is on your phone can wait till after you're are done driving and the car is in park and everyone is safe and not in danger. Looking away from the road for even just 2 seconds can be the difference between life and death because one moment the roads might be clear and the next you could be rolled over trapped in your car.

When you are on your phone while driving, you are not only putting your life in danger but the lives of everyone around you on the road and possibly even pedestrians on the side of the roads. There are many deferent alternatives to being on your phone while driving, such as Bluetooth enabled devices that connect to the car so that you can still talk on the phone without using your hands.

Over 1.6 million crashes yearly happen according to The National Safety Council. More than 220 million people in the US have a wireless service and just about 80 percent use phones while driving. Did you know you can be charged with multiple charges and a fee of 150 dollars and you lose a point to your driving record.

To me phones should not be used on the roads unless it is for an emergency. I have personally had an experience when my mom was texting and driving which led us almost getting into a car accident. Results from using phones while driving can lead to death, PTSD, depression if you get into a car accident. Using a phone while driving increases the risk of their lives. Also the drivers are more distracted making it hard to focus on the road which is leading to crashing. When stopped at a red light people feel as if it is safe little do they know it is just as risky because a car can come smashing into you and you wouldn't see it. Also you can make people mad because the light could turn green and you could be holding up a line.

For people to use their phone less there was a bluetooth, a hands free thing and air play which all 3 limit the use of the phone where you can just talk. It still is not safe but it is not as bad as using your actual phone. Instead of holding the phone to your ear you just speak, call whoever and you don't have to touch your phone. It is easier to just wait to text or use your phone than to rather take your life. For Iphone users apple company made a do not disturb to mute the notifications, which is when you won't receive any notifications until you turn that mode off. There is also a driving mode you can turn on to send a message to a person who texts or calls you saying that you are driving and they won't see their message until they stop driving and check it.

Well-enforced traffic laws have been a highly effective countermeasure for reducing risky driving behaviors and the associated crashes, deaths, and injuries. However, it is not clear that laws limiting drivers' cellphone use are having the same beneficial effects. The research on the effects of driver cellphone and texting bans found mixed results.

E341A9A188EB,"Because it's a common activity for most people, sending a text doesn't seem dangerous. However, when you're doing it behind the wheel, there are a ton of other factors at play. Driving is a privilege because of the inherent risk and responsibility we all need to assume out on the road. When you choose to text and drive, you're threatening every single driver around you and placing more value on that text message than yourself and your fellow drivers.

It can be hard to grasp the dangers of texting and driving, but once you know the facts, this hazardous habit starts to become a reality. When you're engulfed in a texting conversation, it's easy to forget you're sharing the road with other people. In just the 5 seconds it takes to send or read a short text message, you've already zoomed past the length of a football field with minimal attention on the road ahead. Would you want a family member or friend to be on the road with someone so oblivious to the traffic around them? Remember, every time you get behind the wheel, you're entering a shared experience with mothers, fathers, friends, and children.

No driver wants to think about being responsible for a traffic accident that takes his or her own life or the lives of other motorists or pedestrians. Nevertheless, most drivers still use their cell phones while operating their vehicle. While taking a phone call is dangerous enough, the advent of text messaging made cell phones even more incompatible with driving a car. Reading or sending a text or email takes both eyes off of the road, your mind off the task of driving, and sometimes both hands off the wheel.

When you're behind the wheel, you should always be considerate of other drivers and remember you're putting your life at risk while texting and driving.

Transporting other human beings in your vehicle is a tremendous responsibility, on that many young drivers take lightly. Sending or reading a text message while driving puts your passengers' lives at a significantly higher risk of being involved in an accident while riding in your vehicle. Could you live with the knowledge that your decision to pick up your phone while operating a vehicle caused someone to suffer a life-altering injury or be killed?

While driving, you should always be focused on getting from point A to point B. Having any kind of mobile device in your hand while driving puts your life at a major risk. Once driver takes his or her eyes off the road to read a text message, suddenly the driver's life is changed by a horrific accident. People should definitely reconsider before pulling out their phones while on the road. Dr   ",5,Phones and driving,Independent

Many people have the bad habit of using their cell phones while they're driving every time they step into a car to drive somewhere. Both teens and adults have this habit and most drivers are aware that it is not a good habit to have. They could be texting people, calling people, getting on social media, etc. However, using a cell phone while driving is a huge distraction to the driver which is why it is such a bad habit to have. There are plenty of reasons as to why people should not use their phone while they're driving and why it's so dangerous to do so. If people are on their phone while they're driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident, they can get a ticket, and they give a bad influence to young people which is why people shouldn't do it.

Since some people go on their phone while they're driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident. If a person causes a car accident because of being on their phone, it can cause harm and even death to the driver, the passengers in the driver's car, other people driving on the road, and even pedestrians. There are many handfree ways to use a cell phone while driving instead of having the phone in the hand of the driver. According to a website called driving-tests. org, it states, ""Hands-free technology is easy to use and widely available."" An example of a hands-free technology that people can easily use would be a phone holder. With phone holders, people can place their phone in the phone holder on the dashboard so they can answer phone calls, use their GPS, etc. If the people with the bad habit of using their phones while driving get a phone holder, it would decrease the chances of getting into a car accident which will benefit everyone.

Being on the phone while driving not only is very dangerous and unsafe, it is illegal in most states to have a mobile device in the hands on a driver. Having a mobile device in the hands of a driver at any age is illegal in 10 states while having a mobile device in the hands of a novice driver is illegal in 32 states. Since it is illegal in most states, the consequences could be getting a ticket, having to pay a fine, or possibly getting some jail time. There is a website called araglegal. com, and on the website it says, ""Texting and driving makes a crash up to 23 times more likely."" That is the reason it is illegal to even have a phone in the hand of a driver in some states because it results in bad consequences. To avoid bad consequences from happening, drivers can be smart to not even touch their phone while they're driving, they could easily pull over to use their phone instead of using it while driving, etc.

Many adults use their cellular device while they're driving and sometimes, they even do it with their kids in the car. Doing that sets a bad example and gives a horrible influence on kids.

When kids grow up and learn how to drive, they might use their phone while they're driving because they're going to think that it's okay since their parents did the same exact thing.

According to ""4 Reasons Why You Shouldn't Text and Drive,"" it states, ""Why wouldn't young drivers think it's okay to text and drive? They've seen other people do it, perhaps even their parents."" That quote from the website explains the mindset of a young driver perfectly; Having this mindset as a young driver is not good to have because it can cause multiple consequences for them. So if adults don't use their phone while they're driving, especially when their kids are in the car, young drivers will make the smart decision and not be on their device while driving.

Almost everyone knows that it's dangerous to be on the phone while they're driving but people still do it regardless. It would make the world so much easier if people stayed off their phones while driving because there wouldn't be as many car accidents happening. Every driver needs to think about what would happen if they caused a car accident just because they were on their phone and driving at the same time. If someone caused a car accident because they were paying attention to their phone and not the road, and someone died, the person that caused the accident would feel so guilty. In conclusion, every driver needs to know the dangers of being on their phone while driving and why they shouldn't do it so there can be less car accidents. If people are on their phone while they're driving, they are more likely to cause a car accident, they can get a ticket, and they give a bad influence to young people which is why people shouldn't do it.

The rate of of people dying in automobiles has increased 300% because of people using their phones while driving. Using a phone while driving should NOT even be debatable. The consequences that could come with that are way too dangerous. It could cause distractions, an accident or even worse, death. Being in any of those situations could be very harmful not just to you but the others in the car with you. The government should get involved by making laws.

Using phones while driving should be illegal everywhere.

To begin with, using your phone while driving could cause a distraction. For example, if you're driving and there's an ambulance or a police officer trying to get through because of an emergency, the driver may not hear or see the sirens because they are distracted on their phone. Someone could be critical conditions in the ambulance but can't get the hospital because of the person that's distracted on their phone. Sometimes you have to use your phone for an emergency. Just wait till you get to your destination. Cell phone distractions can also cause problems to a pedestrian or even a driver that is swerving. Being distracted by a cell phone is similar to being drunk and driving.

Another consequence that it could have is an accident could occur. It could be the slightest accident but its still considered an accident. Which means someone has to call the cops to report the accident and the cop will take at least 45-60 minutes just to arrive which is a waste of time and money because if it was your fault your insurance cost rise up 60+ more a month. Depending on what the driver already pays it could be way more. That's just for a slight accident. All of that for using your mobile device.

Last but not least, the use of your phone while driving can cause death. The driver could be so distracted that they are unaware of how fast they are driving. If you get into a head on accident at a high speed it can cause death or even crashing into a tree at high speed it can do the same. If you have others in the car with you, you're putting others lives at danger. That could affect the people that love you and love them as well. All of that because you forgot to shoot someone a text back.

Yes, we get it, sometimes using your phone while you're driving is needed for an emergency. Don't just use it to text your friends back or to put music on. Do all that before you take off. Because remember all the bad things that could happen just for using your phone while driving. Keep your eyes on the road.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Although Cell Phones are pretty useful it does not mean that people should be glued on to it the whole time. They may help connect one another, but at some points, the phone has to be put down. Such as when someone is doing tasks that need them to be focused. For example, driving needs the person driving to be all the way focused. Although most people may tend to use their phones for a GPS system most cars in this modern day have a GPS system within it. Phones should not be used in driving because of less attention on the road, setting a bad example for young children, and it is worse than driving under the influence.

First of all, cell phones are a Manual distraction. This means that the tasks that require the driver to take a hand off the steering wheel and manipulate a device. (Hilbert 24) Due to this, the driver is more distracted and unsafe when driving. According to the text ""This inventory highlighted aspects of equipment designs that could affect driver distraction.""(Hilbert 30) This means that the driver would spend more time looking at a screen than on the road. As stated by the author, ""Cellular phones, and other in-vehicle distractions, force drivers to divide their limited attentional resources among tasks, thereby focusing less of their attention on driving."" (Delashmit 160)

Phones may still be useful for people but less time looking at the road is still not a good thing and could set a bad example for younger children.

Secondly, children have a developing mind. Meaning that certain events may scar them for life. They may even think that it is okay to be on the phone. As it states in the text "" For example, Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, in collaboration with NHTSA, found that driver inattention was involved in 80 percent of all vehicle crashes (65 percent of near-crashes)."" (Delashmit 150) If a parent or older sibling, while a child is in a car, is on the phone when driving then they are more likely to be distracted from the road and crash. The younger people are trusting the person who is driving and if there were to be an accident then it could start the development to a mental health disorder. As stated by the author ""These implications highlight the degree to which a child or adolescent is likely to be involved, witness or experience a crash or the consequences of a crash and therefore be subjected to any number of physical injuries or psychological disorders.""(Greydanus 92) If it was not bad enough driving under the influence is a little like worse then spending eighty percent of the time on the phone while driving.

Finally, although driving under the influence is bad, it is still not worse then spending more time looking on the phone then on the road. As stated in the text ""The public does not appear to be as cognizant of this social responsibility aspect, as distinct from personal risk, for in-vehicle technology use, compared to alcohol.""(Hilbert 153) This meaning that driving under the influence is not as bad as being on the phone.

A test was conducted to see how drivers would drive under the influence or on the phone. The results where ""Some studies of cell phone use have compared the degradation of performance to some level of alcohol impairment. Strayer, Drews, & Crouch (2006), for example, found in a study of simulated driving that drivers using cell phones had elevated crash risks similar to those of drivers with blood alcohol concentrations of approximately .08 g/dL, though the specific impairments of each group differed."" This test showed that there were more accidents with being on the phone than driving under the influence.

Although some may say that having the phone out is okay seeing as it is used for navigation. There are laws in place for driving and having a cellular device. As stated by the text ""These laws take several forms: Some require drivers to use a hands-free device if they want to talk on the phone, some prohibit younger or less experienced drivers from using any type of cell phone, and some allow officers to cite drivers for using a handheld cell phone if the driver is pulled over for another offense.""(Guerin 163) As shown they only get in trouble or is only bad if they have it in their hand only if they get pulled over and the officer sees it in their hand. Driving while on the phone is not bad.

In conclusion, phones and driving is not that good. It puts the risk of lives on the line. It causes more vehicle accidents on the road than any other distraction. Although it maybe be handy to help navigate it still should not be used eighty percent of the time while on the road. It sets a bad example for children. It is still slightly worse then driving under the influence. Driving and having a phone out is bad.

In 2015, the United States started to focus on the problem that was phone use while driving. Distracted driving has taken many innocent lives. According to enddd. com 37,416 lives were lost in 2016 due to distracted driving. No matter how much the death rate rises people still use their phones while operating a vehicle. Most people have the argument that having a phone mounted so they could have two hands on the wheel eliminates the problem. However, the level of danger is still high. There are opinions that the use of cell phones while driving have little to no negative effects, but there is much more compelling evidence that it is a serious hazard to be distracted while driving.

While driving with other motorist around, it is imperative to keep all focus on the road. The smallest mistake could lead to a major accident including people that were not involved. In 2012 alone, 3,328 people were killed in distracted driving crashes, a number that continues to go up (Distraction. Gov). As technology advances they rate of distracted driving increasing. It has been uncovered that people between the ages of 18 and 25 have the highest rates of distracted driving. Text messaging creates a crash risk 23 times worse than driving while not distracted (Distraction. Gov).

On the contrary, it is understood that a phone might need to be used in a state of emergency. However, answering to an emergency can cause one of your own. Imagine being in a state of panic and stress with the addition of cell phone use while driving. Now there is another state of peril. It's better to get to the emergency than not getting there at all.

In conclusion, people are still being severely injured and even killed because of drivers distracted by phones. People walk through and across the streets scared for their lives, wondering if they will make it to their destination. How many deaths must occur before people realize how dangerous their actions can be? No one will ever know the real answer How many children are going to have to lose their parents, or for that matter, how many parents are going to have to lose their children before this danger can be stopped? No one will ever know the answer. All that can be done, as of now, is to try the best ways that can be done.            ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

PROPER_NAME

People should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle.

There are several reasons why and I will be discussing two of them. Cell phones are a convience to our society, but there should be a time and place for them to be used.

First, cell phones are a benefit and allows everyone to have access to a telephone at all times of the day.

Kids, teenagers, adults, even grandparents have cell phones.

As you pay attention to people that you pass by whether it's in traffic or walking, there is a cell phone in toat.

While riding a bike, people are on the phone.

While driving cars, people are on the phone.

While sitting waiting for a bus, people are on the phone.

Even while people are walking they are on the phone.

Do they get any break?

The phone that is?

With all of this phone use where is the focus of the individual?

Individual focus does not exist when everyone is on their cell phone.

Whether they are looking at the weather, SnapChat, Facebook, or Instagram, they are still not focused on their surroundings.

With the lack of focus there have been more accidents and deaths.

Accidents occur when you are distracted and death can easily follow.

While driving the attention needs to be on the road.

There have been documentaries where those that have lost loved ones due to inappropriate cell phone use read the last message that was sent or the last words that they user said.

Many times that call or message wasn't that important and could have waited.

Overall, individuals should not use cell phones while driving.

They cause distraction and lack of focus.

Many lives could be saved if people weren't careful about their cell phone usage.   ",2,Phones and driving,Independent

Smart phones have not been around for a very long time , but they have hugely impacted today's society. People can literally use their phones for anything which is not good , because it has become an addiction for many people. They are using them at the wrong times and of them is while driving. People are so focused on their phones that they risk their safety and others safety everyday. 1 reason that it's bad is because you can't pay attention to the road which can cause accidents and driving with 1 hand is not easy. This a very big hazzard that can be stopped , but people would rather be on their phones.

The National Safety Council report that cell phone use while drivng leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries are caused from texting while driving. This is not good. Too many people are being hurt and some are even killed from these fatal car crashes. The regulations must be changed because this is making the roads unsafe. People should not have to worry about if their life is in danger or not because someone is in on their phone.

In conclusion Phones and Driving isn't safe and it should not be permitted.

The Risk is very high and too many people are being hurt by the situation. We should try to fix this problem as soon as possible.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent

First, cell phones and humans are like a duo and used by them almost every day. Humans and cars are also another duo or like a duo. But, people phones and cars and or driving? That personally is not a good idea. That is what I will be explaining in this essay. Is it or it is not a good idea to be texting and driving at the same time? Many different opinions from different people but, here is mine.

Next, have you ever been on a road with more than one lane and the person next to you is looking down on their device? Ask yourself do you think that is safe? Operating a cell phone is okay, and is done on a daily basis. People often think that since they have been texting and driving for long periods of time that they are experts and can do it with no problem. When in reality anything can happen at any moment you look down at your device, and it is certainly not safe.

Then, one of the number one causes of death in the world is car accidents. Usually it comes from texting and driving or even a drunk driver. Texting and driving is not safe and people should NOT be able to operate a vehicle and use cell phones. Why? Because, people die every day from a car accident either because of a device or drinking and driving. I believe that it will decrease the number of crashes and save many lives.

Therefore, Driving and texting should not be allowed. Very dangerous and you have a high risk of losing your life and others in your car and around your car. If you are in a vehicle your phone should not even be your main focus, because the road should have all of your attention. It is better to be safe than sorry on the road, and help prevent many accidents.

In conclusion,

I think phones and driving should NOT happen together. I mean as in texting and driving at the same time. It has been a law but is barely followed by anyone. Many people will still text and drive but, for people who care about other they will follow this law. Maybe even one day they will prevent someone else from losing their life.

Studies have shown that cell phone usage while operating a vehicle causes more car accidents than hands free driving.

It has been proven that driving without the use of your cell phone is 100% safer than driving while using your cell phone. Humans should not operate cell phones while driving, cell phone usage while driving is unsafe, People who use cell phones while driving put their lives in serious danger.

Humans should not operate cell phones while driving. People use their phones on a daily basis while driving yet, they pay little attention to the road while doing so. This can possibly cause accidents to happen. Many people have lost their life due texting and driving and just being on their phones. When driving its best to do it safely for the sake of your own like and others. Using your phone while driving dramatically increases your chances of crashing.

Cell phone usage while driving is unsafe. #1 reason why it is unsafe is because you can lose your life. Just reaching for things while driving takes your main focus off of the road and put you in danger. When your distracted from the road anything can happen even if its just a second thats all it takes for everything to go bad. For instance the second you look down at your phone for that text message is the same secon a pedestrian can walk across the street or another vehicle can cross your path and just like that your life can be ruined or it can be over.

People who use their phones while driving put their lives in serious danger. Recent studies have shown that the victims on texting and driving accidents are young drivers and the elderly. Kids are too attached to their phones and having a car at a young age today is an immediate risk one text message and they instantly have to read the message and at that moment it could be over. Cell phones should be put away while driving or on a phone holder just to keep things safe. All attention should be on the road and if needed a person can easily pull over and make a call.

Just put down the phone that one message or missed call can wait its not worth your life. People should stay safe and just be patient and pay attention to the road and others.                     ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Phones and Driving don't mix. Driving with a phone causes more wrecks every year. Law enforcement have noticed the unsafety of having a phone while driving and made it where it is illegal.

Phones make it where the drive get sidetrack and can cause a wreck, and affect everyone life in the vehicle not just yourself. One thing that is big while driving that is a safety issues, is texting while driving. Texting on the phone is the number one reason people use their phone while driving on the road.

Driving while on the phone can be the number one thing that causes death in a car by accident. When you're driving remember you got life of other people in your hand.

They trust you not to go off the road or into another car just because you looked down at your phone.

The number one reason why I think you should not because I know family member who died and was in a wreck because of them looking at their phone.

A phone is just a distraction. When driving just put the phone away till you're not driving anymore. Just like the tv commercial always says, ""A text can wait"", but your like can't if you die by texting while driving. Driving is a serious manner and it takes all you focus not to mess up. Put it away it as easy as 3 seconds.

Everyday people die in car accidents and or get injured very badly because they use cell phones while driving. It is illegal in many states and it is bad to use hand-held devices and drive because these actions could lead to vehicle crashes. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.

One reason drivers should not use cellphones while texting and driving is because it is illegal in most states. If drivers are caught using their cellphones while driving they will be forced to pay a fine. Fines can cost from $20 to $250 dollars depending on different aspects. This fine is supposed to intimidate people when they use a cell phone while driving. People need to take caution of their surroundings so there are no wrecks; therefore, if you look down at your phone even for just a second a lot could happen which is why you need to be more alert while driving.

Another reason why not to use a cellphone and drive is because there are alternatives to cell phones that are much less dangerous. For example, the earpiece can be used to accept calls and to talk into this way you can keep both hands on the steering wheel. Do not have both earpieces in so you can listen out for other vehicles and your surrounding. Another hands free device is a car kit, if you do not have one in your car you can always buy one. Car kit is basically a touch screen radio and instead of texting you can voice your text to the carkit. It is okay to use your phone as long as your car is in p (park).

In conclusion, you should not use a cellphone while driving because it is illegal, it can lead to vehicle crashes. There are alternatives that are safer than cell phones when on the road.

Communication has progressed from the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 to the endless communication that is now available in the 21st century, but it has come at a price. People's need for communication, specifically with cell-phones has created the serious issue of cell-phone use while driving. This issue leads to serious consequences, and has been met with new laws and features added to cars to keep the roads safe from cell-phone use while driving.

This issue has caused various accidents and sometimes deaths. The distraction that cell-phones create while driving has the ability to seriously injure or even take someone's life away. For many years, while most states have not had laws regulating cell-phone use while driving, there have been various PSA campaigns warning against cell-phone use while driving, usually specific with texting and driving. These PSAs are meant to scare drivers hoping that it will discourage this dangerous behavior.

These distracted drivers are usually texting to reply to someone, using their satellite navigation system on their phone, or could be adjusting their music through their phone. These behaviors have been specifically targeted by many states that have enacted laws to prevent cell-phone use that can cause accidents. Georgia, specifically, passed the hands-free rule, fining drivers for cell-phone use, holding the phone. This law can be easily obeyed because of the adjustments created by car companies and other accessories that are available. More recent cars have options for phones through the car to keep the driver focused on the road but keeping the communication possible for the driver. Cars may have an aux cord or a bluetooth option to be able to receive and make calls without touching the phone. Phones connected to the car this way, can play music through a cell-phone through the car, then the driver can control volume and choice of song through the steering wheel. There are many car accessories to make phone use safer like an attachment to the windshield that holds the driver's phone, to keep their eyes in the front to the road rather than to the side to look at their phone. These adjustments that coincide with laws like the hands-free rule allow drivers to safely use their cell-phones while driving.

This issue has lead to serious consequences, and has been met with new laws and features added to cars to keep the roads safe from cell-phone use while driving, but will continue to have serious consequences. While there are many solutions to this issue have been created it will still have consequences. People will continue to be injured or killed by this issue but without any restrictions or inventions this issue would not continued at the same rate. The precautions keep the roads as safe as they can be, because people will continue to use their cell-phones while driving, but at least it is more regulated and less distracting now.

But should we be able to use our cell phones while being on the road? The number of people that have used their phones on the roads and highways have increased so much . Some people don't understand how important it is to be completely focused on the road and for the people in their car and everyone near them. Should we leave a message unread or not answer a call or answer the text or call but be at risk of causing the life of someone ?

People tend to always want to be on their phones and be in touch with other people during social media, call, or text , despite the danger of causing an accident. We keep our phones closer than our loved ones. Phones are a constant distraction such as meetings, movies ,meals and especially when we are driving. Everyday people die from car accidents because someone was using their phone while driving . Studies have shown that there is a 4% greater risk of drivers being in a car accident due to using a cell phone. Overall the crashes every year because of cell phones are 1.6 millions with 330,000 million injured in them.

Hands free devices can also be harmful . You are focused on the road but if something happens to your phone for example the call ended or you received a message then you are distracted and want to grab your phone . A lot of people would think that probably if I just take one second to look at my phone nothing will happen. But that's not true a car accident can happen based on the driver not looking on the road . You can't multitask when you are driving ! If you would like to be a safe driver you would have to make sure you process a ton of information about your environment and surroundings at all times.

Georgia's new hands free cell phone law has resulted in more than 1,000 tickets since the start of the law . Georgia's residents aren't allowed to have their phone in their hand or part of their body . They are only allowed to use if it's on a wireless headphones, speaker or bluetooth . Their first fine is $50 , second is $100, and third is $150 and a subsequent conviction . Georgia has become the 16th state that enacted a hands free driving law. Georgia would like for residents to stop using their devices when driving because cell phones only continue to increase the number of accidents.

It's a privilege to be able to drive and we shouldn't just think about ourselves but about the people we are risking when we are driving. Cell phones are a very important tool in our life but we should know when it's not the right time to use it.

Even though people this they can do it without an accident, people should not be using a phone while driving. Teens, being the main group of people driving distracted, including the fact that the majority of they are newly trained drivers could cause more damage than just a crash. In 2017, over 3000 people were killed due to drivers being distracted. Some things aren't worth the risk and can just be pushed off to another time. While driving and using the device you are putting other drivers, passengers, bystanders and even yourself at risk of getting hurt or much worse.

In any case, while you are texting and driving, you are not thinking about anyone else other than yourself. The main thing going through a person's head while on their phone is what's happening on the screen. You readers may have, or know someone who could be looking at their phone and not hear a word someone says. It's already disrespectful to be on your phone while talking to somebody, so imagine how crazy it is to be on it while operating dangerous vehicle at high speeds. Texting and driving is more of an impulse, the driver is more worried about getting caught than hurt ,but the punishment of death and homicide is worse than texting and driving.

Without a doubt, you may think that the person you are texting or the game that you are playing can be done at another time. The game can wait till you are out of the car, but if you need to communicate with someone, there are many alternatives than doing it while driving. You have option to call someone and put your phone on spreaker so it will be out of your way, pulling over into a parking lot is also a choice and finally texting at a red light or stop sign only if its legal in your state. Like the famous quote from Star Trek, The

Wrath of Khan, ""the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few"" meaning that you have to put the majority over yourself even if you think you shouldn't.

Although, you may not want to die, there are still more simple reasons you should avoid using your phone while driving. If you get caught you will have to pay an expensive fine and your car insurance will go up. Paying hundreds of dollars is not worth one text, one youtube video of anything else you could be doing on it. Most of the people who text and drive probably is doing it because they will be busy later, but going to court for a ticket will just add more to your schedule.

As a result, you as a reader can see all the risks and should yourself

""is this really worth it""? In a situation like this, the cons outweigh the pros and that's not good. If you want others to care about you then you have to respect yourself first to show them what it looks like. Think about the family of the kid you ran over all to heart some instagram post, it's not worth it. If you truly want to be a responsible driver, then obey the laws and don't use your phone while driving.

In my perspective, I think drivers should not use cell phones while operating a vehicle. The reason why I say this is because people don't pay any attention to what they are doing because they so caught up in their devices. Driver can get killed and they can hurt somebody else if they are using their cell phones. They not only putting their life in danger, but also somebody else's life too.

Drivers can be drunk while driving and be on their cell phone and end up killing themselves. Instead of being save and advoiding that risk that they are doing right now, they are being very dangerous of themselves and others. That's why now in today's history, it is rare that people pull over on the side of the road to be on their cell phones. The ones who do that are very smart because they aren't taking a risk to hurt themselves or others.

You have to be careful of what you are doing when you're in a car driving and being on the phone. That's why today, a lot of people buy a cell phone holder to put in their car. The reason is that they can talk on the phone but also pay attention to the road so they won't get in a car crash. It is just crazy that people would not think about what they are going to do when they are using a cell phone when they are driving.

Technology has extremely increased in today's generation. Many people have a tendency to rely on their devices while driving. Phones are very addictive to have. People surely can't get their eyes off the devices for more than at least a minute. They will look at the phone while doing everything. The main problem that is occurring is that people are texting while driving an automobile. Should or shouldn't drivers be able to use their cellphones while operating a vehicle.

I believe drivers shouldn't be able to use their cellphones while driving unless for navigation. It's extremely dangerous to look of the road to send one simple text messages. For example, if you are driving at 55mph while texting or looking at your phone; within them seconds you could have easily got into a car accident with major injuries. This reason is only one reason you shouldn't be able to use your cellphone while driving.

Another reason that you shouldn't be able to use your cellular device while driving is it puts your life at risk and put other innocent lives at risk. When you make the decision to text and drive, you make the decision to risk the lives of those around you and your life as well. That simple action of ""answering a quick text"" or even glancing at a text means that you are selfishly putting other people's lives in danger. It is one thing to put your own life in danger, but it is unfair and unnecessary to risk the lives of others. These innocent people; young children, friends in your car, pedestrians, and fellow drivers, did absolutely nothing wrong and are forced to have their lives at risk solely due to a poor decision that you made.

The last and final reason is that it's illegal. Regardless of the all the harm caused by texting and driving, it is also illegal in many states. Fines and punishments for texting and driving range greatly depending on the state that you live in; for some states, the fine is merely $20, however, in others, it can be up to $500. And, if the action of texting and driving ends in injuring any other individuals, you can actually end up in jail, depending on the severity of the injury. This right here is just the icing on the cake as to why you should stop texting and driving!

In conclusion, people shouldn't be able to operate a cellphone while driving, unless it for directions, a vehicle because it is very dangerous and also illegal. Taking your eyes off the road for one text can take a life. It's okay to want until your done driving to use your cellphones! So please keep your eyes on the road and don't pick up the phone.

The risk of texting and driving is a big risk, you take 20-35 seconds to look, type, and deliver a message while operating a vehicle going at a fast pace which could potentially hit anyone or anything under those few seconds leaving the driver and them hurt or possibly even dead. It is said that in the United States around 1 out of 10 people are killed by distracted drivers everyday because they choose to put their attention towards texting instead of focusing on the wheel. In today's society mostly everything is run off by technology and its how nowadays we communicate with one another, but there are moments when it is necessary to put down your devices and it's when you are driving a vehicle.

There are many methods on preventing texting and driving and one is simply just putting your device down and not use it when behind the wheel. Another way to prevent texting and driving is using a cell phone stand which prevents you from looking down at your phone but instead having the phone next to your view of the road. If anybody else is in the car let they should wield the device while the driver is operating the vehicle and let them know if any important notifications appear. These methods just take very little time so they can prevent a risk of taking the driver's life or anybody who is at risk of being a victim of a distracted driver.

It is believed to say people are more likely to die in a car crash by a distracted driver rather than a driver who is drunk or under the influence of marijuana. Even if that is to be said, there are still people that are confident enough to multi-task and risk the chances yet they don't know their reaction time is slow as an elderly due to them paying attention to several things at once which causes a commotion in the brain.

Phone companies such as AT&T have tried preventing these kind of things by starting a campaign and having traffic signs say things to prevent drivers from being on their phones while driving. These acts help prevent accidents and possibly reduce accidents in the future.

In my honest opinion about phone's and driving they do not go together at because both you have to use full attention on when using especially with how things are now and days. It's really dangerous when doing it driving a car because cars are this big built mobile that if you get into a crash and risk your life and or money for insurance on it. Now I think you could balance it between Phone and driving if your good at that like at a red light maybe take a quick glance and it see what it is and then back to driving or get a car that can pick up phone calls.

Now with phones people are so attracted to phones now they can't even walk straight without bumping into people now is it bad to use phones no I don't think it is but when driving is a different story you are putting your life a risk with using a phone. You are putting other peoples life's at risk with doing that too.

When it comes to cars you need your full attention when driving a car everything needs to be sharp because there is dangerous things everywhere so you need to be aware of that when driving so that nothing bad happens. You can't do that when you're on a phone because you're taking away your senses from driving.

I don't think it is a good idea at all to do it unless you know what you're doing and have a car that can pick up phone calls and does not take your time away from driving on the road and therefore can keep you safe and everyone else around and get to your destination safely.

Generation X is constantly caught having used a cellphone while operating a vehicle. The cell phone is a ""life saver"" and helps individuals with everyday tasks. However, while driving to a destination is the use of a cell phone prohibited? And if not, to what extent is it ok to use a mobile on the road?

The use of cellphones on the road is legal with certain restrictions in which not followed could result in a justified prosecution. Driving with a cellular device under the age of 18 while driving is strictly prohibited. Driving is a more taxing experience than most realize. It is a death sentence if not taken seriously. Nearly 1.6 million crashes happen annually to texting and driving. This is due to the driver taking his/her attention of the road and not being aware of their surroundings. There should be not lenience when it comes to texting and driving and should be promoted not be a social norm.

Texting and driving is not a smart way to drive. There are too many variables as to what the outcome could turn out to be. Many people lose their lives to such things. Is that one text really worth someone's life?                                       ",3,Phones and driving,Independent

Texting and driving has become a huge issue. Many car accidents have occurred by being on the phone. Most people think texting and driving is not a serious thing but in reality, it has caused many lives. Police have been cracking down and a lot on this situation. Phone companies like Apple have put a do not disturb setting on the phone for driving. You turn it on and it will silence all calls and texts messages, so it won't temp you to pick up your phone. Many teens have been in an accident due to texting and driving. This has become a dangerous issue in society that has caused many lived and needs to be stopped.

In this paragraph I am going to be talking about the dangers that texting and driving have. Currently 46 states have banned texting and driving due to many accidents. This problem is occurring a lot with young teens. Many teens don't know how to put their phone down while driving they feel they need to always have it in their hand. 21% of teen drivers who were involved in fatal car accidents were distracted by their cell phones. 330,000 injuries arise each year from texting a driving. There are many organizations dealing with texting and driving. They also have addictions programs if you are addicted to your phone and cannot put it down. Phone addiction is a real thing, many people struggle with and don't realize it. Sources say that ""94% of drivers support imposing a ban on texting while driving"". It has been proven that texting while driving its 6x more likely to cause an accident than driving drunk and that really should tell you something. This is huge problem that can be solves so easily if people would just put their phone down.

Many car companies have been making self-driving cars. This makes people think it is okay to be on their phone while driving because the car is driving itself when in realty it is just as dangerous. I think texting white driving is a horrible thing I think it should be banned. I say this because many have died and many more were injured. It should not be allowed at all it puts the person that's driving in danger and other drivers. I think that police cracking down on texting and driving is a good thing. It will make more people stop doing it if they know they will get a ticket or possibly jail time. People will not stop until they know it will be serious consequences, they don't take it as a big deal. Research also shows that when people are talking on the phone, crash risk quadruples. The national safety council estimated that cellphone use leads to more than 1.6 million crashes every year. A first offence of texting while driving is 50 or more. I think that price needs to be much high then 50 dollars. I say this because if tickets were higher like maybe 100 or more lots of people wouldn't be texting and driving because they wouldn't want to pay that high ticket.

In conclusion I think texting and driving is a horrible thing that needs to be stopped. How many more lives is it going to take before people see how horrible it is. As a society we need to do better for our safety. We need to stop being so distracted by our phones and focus on making it where we need to go safely. The biggest age group affected by this problem is aging from 16 to 30. We need our young teens and our adults to do better and learn to put the phone down for their own safety. In the end we all want our country to be better and safer place. We want to live are life to the fullest and enjoy the good times so we should start thinking wise and be safer and it can start by not texting while driving.     ",4,Phones and driving,Independent
4457F02B554A,"Drivers should not be able to use a cell in any capacity while operating a vehicle. I feel like that's the least safe thing you can do while a driving a motored vehicle. I think all of your undivided attention should be focused on driving. Your life isn't the only one in harm, but you're also jeopardizing someone else's life putting them in harm. Safety first; extracurricular activities later.

First of all, driving while you're on your phone is very dangerous and can be life threating within just 5 seconds. Most car accidents today are from people who were distracted by their phones. According to statistics from ""The National Safety Council"", cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. I feel like if more people were less distracted by their phones then there would be fewer car accidents than there are today. One out every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving.

Second of all, though you may be only replying to a quick text or answering a quick call, but those few seconds you took to look at your phone traffic is still going. I agree that phones should not be in use while operating a vehicle because not only does the phone user get dangerously injured, it could cause someone else get hurt, too. I would advise anyone to not get caught driving while using their device now today because there are consequences.

A cell phone should not be used while operating a vehicle because driving should be number one priority.

Third of all, although I feel as if phones shouldn't be prohibited while operating a car but there are some reasons it would be reasonable to use your phone while driving. I think the only reason you should use your phone is too answer important calls only nothing more. The only way you could answer those important calls are if you have Bluetooth and your phone is connected. I feel that if you have to remove your hand from the steering wheel to use your phone you shouldn't. I say phones should shouldn't be used at all inside of a vehicle that on.

Most of all, drivers shouldn't use their phone while driving because it's very life threatening and dangerous. Driving while texting doesn't only just put your life in harm it puts others that are around. Texting and driving is a big distraction; focus should always be number priority while driving. Most accidents that occur today are from distracted drivers who were on their phone .Even though they were on phones for short amount of time, within that time span a car accident can occur.

In today's society, Phones have become a necessity. There are even some people that own two phones. Many people have become so reliant on their phone that they have built a tendency to use it whenever they can, or when they feel like it is ok to use it. People use their phones when they are out with family, friends, or when they are driving. Phones have become a menace to our safety on the road. Although, there are some drivers that are responsible when it comes to driving, that does not make the road any safer. Everyone still has a chance of getting into an accident with someone who was too busy on their phone while driving.

People who use their phones while driving are part of the menace to our safety. People who use their phones while driving are distracted from what is happening around them. Some people are against phone usage while driving, but are the people who usually do it. People today do not usually commit to a cause because they believe it will never be achieved, so they just join in and start to not care of what might happen next. That is why laws on phone use while driving should be much harsher.

There are laws against phone usage in the United States, but that does not completely stop people from using their phone. Laws should be much stricter, and a bit of a bigger punishment. If the laws that prohibit the use of phones while driving were much stricter then maybe the use of phones while driving will deplete greatly. This will result in accidents going down which would make the road a safer place for new drivers, and drivers in general.

Laws on phone usage while driving should stricter. This resolves in less accidents, safer roads, and cops not having to pull over and write multiple tickets, or arresting as many people just for using their phones as they drive.       ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. That's out of control. America has an addiction problem, and it's all about cell phones. You see ads on tv, on your phone, on billboards, pretty much everywhere, and they are taking american lives.

There's a lot of problems phones bring to the table, but Americans getting distracted by them is one of the most common causes of death in the us. One quick peek at your phone and suddenly there's a semi truck coming at you 100 miles per hour. It can happen in almost an instant. And the numbers are there to back it up! There is no way more than 25% of the people killed per year expected or saw the crash coming.

The government has taken slow action, creating the ""hands-free"" law. This law makes it illegal to touch your phone while driving at all, but it isn't exactly being enforced. Sure, cops are now allowed to arrest people for touching their phone, but it just made people hide their phone better while driving, which honestly causes more accidents.

There are so many ways to fix this problem. For example, apple could make a feature where when your phone is moving above a certain speed, your phone locks itself until you have stopped moving. While Apple has a feature like this, it's easily avoidable as there's a button on the screen that opens your iphone.

I hope these essays give you a reason not to touch your phone while driving. It's just seconds before you realize what's happening, and there's no going back when you cant even see what's coming. It takes little to no effort to put down your phone, and the same amount of effort to stop yourself from picking it up. Drive safe!   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Should phones be acceptable to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle? Today, we will basically cover why people should be able to drive and use their cell phones. Nowadays, with all the technology some cars are capable to drive on their own. Tesla would be a company that has started this whole new thing called autopilot.

Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system which has lane centering, adaptive cruise control, self-parking, the ability to automatically change lanes, and the ability to summon the car to and from a garage or parking spot. If you were to have that feature the car basically drives itself with asking you every 30 seconds to 2 minutes to grab the steering wheel and move it side to side just a little. Tesla has also announced sometime in 2020 that the car will be able to detect stop signs, cross-walks, stop lights, etc,. Which means the car is fully capable to drive itself anywhere you put the navigation to take you and you could fall asleep to your destination.

In addition, the Tesla model 3 has been tested and said to be one of the safest cars in the world with many of its safety features in the cars system. So if you're capable of purchasing the car then I think you should be able to use the phone while driving sense the vehicle is driving to begin with. But if you can not purchase the vehicle I think you should be able to use the navigation system on the phone and have it set up to where it's not dangerous to look of the road for a second as if you were checking how fast your going. Most people can not afford that car and they drive older models of cars which don't have all the new technology in their car and all the extra luxury.

In other words, phones should be allowed for some people to use while driving, while others can not. It really can not be unfair because if it was really important for them to use the phone while driving they might think I should work harder in life to be able to do all their things while driving. So people should and should not be allowed to use their cell phones while driving.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent
034A48259522,"Texting while driving is a profoundly serious topic and it often comes up. Texting and driving are talked about all the time, but people don't take it in consideration to be serious about the situation. Some drivers say ""I can do text while driving"" or ""it'll only take a second"". Thinking / saying that is a foolish thing because all of us feel that we can multitasking. We take these situations lightly until something really happens and then we wish we could take it all back.

Texting and driving can be a serious hazard; for example, a Georgia teen, Cristina PavonBaker, got 15 years for killing her best friend. She was driving 105 mph, racing another student then she started to use snapchat and crashed into a tree. For that reason, I feel that it should be banned in all 50 states because this is a serious cause, and everyone is taking it lightly. People who use cell phones distraction rates are high. In this generation we use our cell phones a lot so when it's hard for us to concentrate and to focus on things that are more important.

When you are texting and driving it's like driving down a soccer field or football field blindfolded. According to my research, texting behind the wheel takes a driver's eye off the road for 2.5 seconds, which is how long it takes to switch lanes. It is dangerous and deadly to not only yourself but also to other drivers and passengers. Texting and driving have beat drinking and driving as the most leading cause of deaths among teens. Us teen are not the only ones, 49 percent of adult drivers admitted that they text and drive.

Teens die every day for making the wrong decisions and not caring about the outcome. We don't care about the law until something happens and we wish that we could go back in time and change everything and not do what we did. The penalties of texting and driving can be jail or prison time or a misdemeanor. The fine could be as low as $20 and as up to $500 depending on the

To sum it up, we would be better if phones weren't allowed in the car at all. You can be killed or can kill someone if you are distracted driving. We are always distracted by our phones so when we are driving, we are tempted to get on it and do stuff. When we do, we have consequences to our actions and sometimes we must pay for what we do. We need to take responsibility and own up for our actions. We need to stop taking things like this lightly. I hope I encouraged you to not do this and put the cell phones down.

There are some people in this world that are extremely good at multitasking but... most aren't. If you feel like you can be on your phone while you're driving you are out of your mind. I feel like the only reasons you should be able to use your phone in the car/ operating machinery is when your using the GPS or trying to play music and at that point you should be using voice control.

Like I said at the beginning of the introduction a lot of us in this world cannot multitask. We don't have the attention span to pay attention to the road and be on our phones. As soon as we see that text from our mom, significant other, or crush whoever it may be we immediately look at the phone and try to text them back. Me knowing me I can't try to do anything phone related because once I'm on my phone I check all my emails, social media, and everything interesting there. Trying to operate machinery while while being on your phone is extremely life threatening especially using power tools and or heavy equipment. When I say heavy machinery I mean cars too.

Teens, adults, and even officials are on their phones, the majority of the day. Although cell phones existence hasn't been very long they've seemed to be a huge impact on today's society. People tend to forget what they're doing outside the phone because of how much a distraction cell phone can be, which leads to accidents and injuries. Many people in today's world have picked up a bad habit of texting and driving and don't realize the fatal accident they have partaken. Texting and driving isn't just reckless it also shows how careless people are of others well being.

To begin, people should not be allowed to text and drive because of the dangers that it brings to the driver and other drivers around them. Texting takes your attention off the road which leads you to not notice things you may have been able to avoid if you were paying attention. Simple things such as slowing down because an animal is crossing the road instead of swerving off the street because of how late you noticed the situation due to the distraction of the phone. In addition to taking your focus off the road, texting and driving also limit your vision at night. When your driving at night the light from the phone can strain your eyes causing you not to be able to see when driving. The screen acts as a mini headlight which blinds the driver making you lose awareness of the road. Texting and driving can limit the abilities of the driver because of how drastic a distraction it can be.

Meanwhile, you also benefit when you're not on your phone and you're aware of the road and everything around you. For starters, a lot of people driving don't realize some of the things they pass by every day because of the fact they're always looking down at their phones. For an example, you may drive useless miles to a gas station because that's the first one you see when you look up from your phone, when there may have been a gas station you missed on the way. Not only that but you stay sure that you're not in trouble with the law. If one is to be caught texting and driving by an official, in addition to legal consequences, the driver can then lose points on there license and/or can get their license suspended or revoked. Teens have been reported to lose their license because of texting and driving which then leads them to have to wait more years in order for them to obtain another one. Adults have gotten the license suspended which causes them to have taken off from work and/or their kids to get another license. Getting your license taken away from you is and having to take time to get another is wasteful and can be avoided easily if you just put your phone down.

In conclusion, texting and driving is a serious matter. The consequences of texting and driving are serious and can the worst thing to happen to many of us. It can lead to your license being taken away from you, it can lead to a waste of gas and money, or more importantly, it can lead to very serious injuries. Put the phones down, the text or post can wait until your off the road.

Cell Phones have become very important to our lives. People use their cell phones for everything; texting, talking and to get on social media. However, these everyday things become a distraction when it comes to driving on the roads. It has become a big issue in modern day America. As more teens text and drive, many cases of texting and driving have occured, resulting in a mass of avoidable lost lives.

In 2016, The national Safety council reported that 1.6 million car crashes a year are caused by reckless teen driving, most of which, are by texting and driving. Teens nowadays can't even put enough effort into not using their phones for at least 20 minutes, and for what cost, their lives? There has to be a kind of restriction on texting, or any kind of activity on your phone, while driving.

Some phones already offer some programs or apps that let you disable your phone while you drive. Drivesafe mode is a built in program that is available only on some phones. Although, most of the programs similar to Drivesafe mode, are supposed to be turned on by the user. This is simple to disregard, and most drivers don't even know they have such kinds of apps on their devices.

As of 2019, most states have gone to the point where they feel the need to ban texting and driving by using the word of law. The state of georgia put in place the ""Hands -free phone"" law which only allows drivers to operate voice controlled devices whilst driving. Still, even with the price of a hefty fine, and in some cases, jail time, people still continue to text and drive.

In conclusion, a good solution to ending deaths and accidents by teens who text and drive, starts with the parents. Parents should monitor their teens phones while they are out. Not only does the technology of today let parents spy on their kids phones just to keep them out of trouble, but it will help keep them alive, too. Parents should keep track of their kids while they go out, and alert them to stop when they text and drive. No one can tell you better than your own parents to stay alive.

Imagine having to spend time in jail or prison because you hit someone and they are harmed, in critical condition or worse, maybe even dead. Besides facing possible jail time, the guilt you would feel for that is unbearable. Which is why using cellphones while operating a vehicle is an unacceptable decision. Not only is it against the law, but for one it is harmful all around, and it is also a complete distraction.

Driving while using a cellular device is illegal. Often times if an officer spots you using a cellphone while noticing you are driving, he or she will pull you over and give you a ticket. For one that's a silly reason for getting a ticket. Now money has to be spent to pay the fine all due to the fact that whatever was on your phone was so important. In some situations there may be an emergency that is that important, but if that's the case you pull over then use your cellphone. Especially if the situation is something that can make you panic, you shouldn't be driving while in a frantic state.

1.6 million crashes a year are due to cellphones. That's a lot! More than what it should be, considering the fact it is against the law. Like I said before the guilt you would feel if you were the cause of someone's serious maybe fatal injury would make you feel horrible. Or imagine if something happened to your loved ones because someone was texting while driving.

If something on your phone may be very important and you feel the need to use your cellphone, then you should pull over into a parking lot or maybe the side of the road depending on the circumstances. Like I stated before if something tragic is happening and your getting a call of text about it the last thing you'd be worried about is the road. Which can can an accident or an almost accident.

BA13728424E7,"Today we as humans live in a society that is controlled by the advancement of technology and as certain things become easier to access, we seem to get distracted by the objects we have at our disposal. Problems in our society become self-evident as statistics show the accidents that happen due to our carelessness. The purpose of this essay is to show the reader as to why cell phones should be prohibited to be in use while conducting a motor vehicle; therefore, I will state and point out facts, statistics, and different sources to support my claim.

The first argument in my essay is the amount of damage that occurs during conducting a vehicle and using a cell phone at the same time. Throughout many years, the toll taken on by drivers has increased greatly. New statistics show up every day as to why accident are occurring on the road. This leaves an increase in death rates as motor accidents can result in injury and death. Laws have been set in place to prevent these accidents; although, there is a change in the rate of accidents, people still decide to use cellphones. A change must occur in order to lower the rates of accidents caused by cell phone use. This could be the most known and dangerous reason as to why cell phones are a harmful distraction during driving.

Although using a cell phone is harmful to a person while driving, sometimes in the case of an emergency, one must use their cell phone in order to receive calls. And to improve the chance of proper navigation through roads, navigation systems allow for easier access to reach certain locations when driving. There are many reasons as to why cell phones could be useful; however, they are greatly outnumbered by the cons. Even if it's to receive a call or text, the problem is not the cell phone itself but ones conscience to obscure their focus from the road. As this is the reason as to why accidents happen in the first place. And as much as we want to reduce these accidents, we must take a priority on to our driving by ourselves setting a restriction as to when we can use our phones while driving.

In addition to my statements, although cell phone use can benefit the driver, we must still restrict any type of use until we can lower the rates of death and accidents connected to each other. As this is the only way we can fully change the situation we are in right now. More strict laws should be placed in order to combat these dilemmas. However, this will not be an immediate change in our society as some will rebel against the new laws that should be placed to be stricter, but it is a step in the right direction and a good continuation in change the social standard of using cell phones while driving. And soon in time, we will see a change in our society all together.

Everyone sees drivers using their phones, but most people don't notice that sometimes it's you. Mobile devices have taken over during this technological era. The majority of people have and enjoy using phones. Whether they're looking at the newest post from someone on social media or texting a friend, family member, or stranger. Phones have the ability to keep people occupied for long or short periods of time. Using phones is okay until it comes to driving while using them. It turns into a whole new scenario where the user is gambling with their life with every tap, swipe, or click. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones for any reason while operating a motor vehicle; it puts you and others lives in danger, it is equally as bad as driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, and it's illegal in most states.

Distracted driving by the use of cellphones alone causes 2,600 deaths yearly. About 330,000 minor or major driving injuries too. Using mobile devices while driving impairs your ability to operate a motor vehicle. Forcing you to take your eyes off the road and focus your attention on it rather than the environment around you. Even if it's just for a couple of seconds, this can be devastating and lead to serious injury. Studies show that drivers who just talk to someone on a cellphone rather than texting respond to emergency braking situations 18 percent slower than if not. Imagine if these drivers were texting rather than just talking, putting their attention more into the message they're sending rather than the road in front of them. An emergency braking situation could be tragic for these drivers and lead to serious injury to them and the drivers in front and behind them. This shows that distracted driving can be devastating to you, and for the people in the vicinity. The danger caused by distracted driving is on par if not worse than driving under the influence.

Driving under the influence is seen as the sin of all driving, but is it really? A study done by Harvard University found that driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs was very similar to driving distracted. 40 patients, nine percent of distracted drivers drove slower before breaking. 24 percent displayed an inability to keep pace with other cars because of the constant shifting of their attention. The same study found drunk drivers drove ""a bit"" slower than distracted and undistracted divers. With a serious increase of aggression, they pace cars more closely and more likely to break only seconds before a collision could occur. They also hit their breaks 23 percent harder than distracted and undistracted drivers. All participants had a BAC higher than 0.08 percent. The zebra's 2017 study states in 2015 drunk driving caused more deaths, while distracted caused more accidents. 10,265 drunk driving deaths vs 3,477 distracted driving deaths. 290,000 injuries caused by drunk driving vs 391,000 injuries caused by distracted driving. While drunk driving caused more deaths distracted driving caused more injuries, injuries that have the possibility of leaving permanent damage on the victim's body. Ruining innocent people's lives impeding what they once were good at just because a driver-focused their attention on their phone rather than their surroundings. States are now taking action against distracted driving to attempt to stop or at least cut down on driving accidents.

Currently, 48 states have banned texting and driving. Washington was the first state to ever pass any form of texting ban, doing it in 2007. 20 states have banned handheld cellphone use. No state has banned complete cellphone use, but 38 states have banned all cellphone use for teenagers who are operating the vehicle. All states who pass these laws all have a common goal. To lower distracted driver accident ratings for the state at hand, but do the laws work? Yes and no, California cell phone usage dropped 57% from 9.3% of drivers to 3.3% using their cellphones after the ban on handhelds in 2008. Even if the usage of cellphones dropped the crash ratings haven't this is where the no comes from. Bans in New York hope to see a decline in crash ratings, but there was basically no difference. The reason being drivers switched from handheld devices to using the car's new built-in interfaces to interact with the outside world. The new built-in interfaces aren't any safer like the companies claim they are and are just as bad when it comes to causing accidents. Banning the use of cellphones while driving did work because the use of actual cellphones dropped, but with new car technology allowing cellphones to connect to the car's interface the risk and threat of distracted driving is still just as bad.

Driving distracted isn't okay, and it never will be. It's the root of a majority of driving accidents. It can cause injury to you and the people around often fatal. It can even cost someone their life. It isn't as life-threatening as driving under the influence, but it's still dangerous.

Driving bans have lowered ratings cellphone use while operating a vehicle, but they still fail in stopping accidents. No matter how many laws are pushed or lives are taken driving distracted is here to stay unless something major changes. Car manufacturers are creating new technology that makes it easier than ever to drive distracted. It's a losing battle and it only gets worse by the year. Drivers shouldn't drive distracted, yet they still do, accidents happen every day. Just try to make sure you aren't on the giving end and hope that you aren't on the receiving.

The future brings many new advances in technology, and along with it, dangers and responsibilities. Cell phones are highly addictive, and although they are beneficial for connecting to the world and finding information efficiently, they have proven to be a major distraction and huge problem for drivers. People often get into car accidents while texting. Drivers should not be allowed within arm's reach of their mobile device because it can harm themselves and others on the road.

First of all, according to seriousaccidents. com, ""Distracted drivers are the top cause of car accidents in the U.S. today."" This means that texting while driving is more dangerous than being intoxicated behind the wheel. People - especially teenagers - can kill themselves and others when they text while operating a motor vehicle. If they're lucky to survive the crash but they kill others, they can serve up to 20 years in prison, according to criminal-law. freeadvice. com. 20 years is a serious amount of time to serve because of a text or call.

Secondly, many students get into car accidents due to texting. They can often collide with other students or adults and may cause an injury or death. Many people believe a text should be responded to in 10 minutes or less, so one can wait to arrive at their destination before texting again. Furthermore,, if a text is too important to ignore, a person should simply pull over so they can respond, instead of distracting themself from the road and putting others at risk.

Thus, no person should be allowed to have their phone while driving due to it posing a threat to one's own health and wellbeing, as well as others'. People should not answer texts or phone calls while they should be focused on the road when it can be such a huge distraction many problems can occur in the short period of time it requires to answer a phone call or text. It is much safer to simply wait to get to your destination.

Although cell phones have not been around for a very long time, they have become a key part of our lives. People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. Sometimes we can even do two or more of these things at the same time. Unfortunately, people are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones. Using a handheld cell phone while driving is dangerous to the driver themselves for a couple of good reasons.

Mobile phone use while driving is common but it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes. Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Many jurisdictions have enacted laws to ban handheld mobile device use. Nevertheless, many jurisdictions allow use of a hands-free device. Driving while using a hands-free device is not safer than using a handheld phone to conduct calls, as concluded by case-crossover studies, epidemiological, simulation, and meta-analysis. In some cases restrictions are directed only at minors, those who are newly qualified license holders (of any age), or to drivers in school zones. In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash.

In the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones.

In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day, while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades. Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone. Drivers who text when behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash. One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting while driving. Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving, there is more to be done      ",5,Phones and driving,Independent
799837826A64,"The majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis, this doesn't mean they should be used while driving. It is a proven fact that more accidents are caused by using cell phones.

It only takes a few seconds to look at your phone and get distracted. Within those few seconds anything could happen. In the state of Georgia the law is its illegal for drivers to have a phone in their hand or use any part of their body to support a phone. This is known as a hands free law. This still doesn't stop people from using their phones. More than 16 million users on snapchat have admitted to using the app to take photos and videos while operating a vehicle. According to traffic safety experts, engaging in any activity that takes your eyes off the road and your hands off the wheel puts both you and other motorists at risk. Is a text or snap really worth your life and everyone around you. Nothing is more important than the safety of you and those around you. Distraction only takes a few seconds. It can wait!

We all have those moments where we need to know where we are going. This doesn't mean we need to hold our phones. Car mounts are an easy way to make it hands free and allows your phone to be eye level.

Nowadays most cars have bluetooth to where you don't have to pick up your phone you can just use your voice. There are also new apps that parents can have so teenagers can't use their phones while driving. Apple also has a setting on their phones to where when you get a text it will automatically send a text saying you are driving and will respond when the car is not in any motion.

The roads will and would be safer if drivers would get car mounts or even just not look at their phones. In the end lives would be saved and less accidents would be caused. Your life is important and so is everyone else around you. It can wait!             ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Can't even imagine the damage that can happen to the cars and yourself. There's a lot of consequences that can all lead back to you that we the community don't want you guys going through it. Here are some of them you can read so you won't regret it later in the future.

Let's say you get a text from someone and you reach for your phone to read the text message and you text them right back. With those few seconds you use to take your eyes off the road to text, you can end up in a car crash. If you are a driver that either has a permit license or a driver's license know that texting while driving is not permitted on the road and can lead you to a big charge from the police. A charge like that can prevent getting your license suspended and add lots of points into your driving record. That's why in different types of states in the United States, they have passed the law of no using your mobile phone while driving.

Alright, everyone should know this consequence or what would be the outcast of it. The injuries that you would have over that car crash. Damn, if it were me in a car crash I would be scared out of my life and praying to god I'm still alive. There's a lot of people who don't even cause the crash and end up getting really bad injuries just because of that one person who decided to choose a poor choice. Also, there's one more thing really traffic that can happen, and

Ramirez 2 that is death. The victim or yourself can end up dead in the car crash and that's something we don't happening.

Last one, it's more important to me in my opinion and is similar to the last one but with one more thing added to it. If you do get in that car crash for being on your phone and you have someone else in the car with you like a friend. You are going to have full responsibilities not only for yourself, but for your friend as well. Your friend's parents are going to have a lot to say not only to you but to your parents too. From there, you are going to cover the medical bills for yourself and for your friend too. Imagine all that money over a poor decision you made by texting someone back. That money could have been used for something good like for college, a new car, or new house.

Nowadays people are on their phones all the time on a daily basis, whether or not these should be allowed while driving is an easy answer. They shouldn't be allowed at all while driving for reasons I will state.

Phones are distracting. Phones aren't like other distractions they almost always require your full attention (unless it's calling). If your browsing social media while driving you're going to be reading what's on your phone rather than drive or you will be playing a game on your phone rather than watching the road you're watching the game. when your texting unless you know the keyboard like the back of your hand then you're going to make typos and grammar mistakes which will lead you to be glued to your screen to make a good text.

Phone use in general is just a bad idea. You aren't giving the road your full 100%

attention while using a phone and if you slip up and look at your phone for a second you can cause an accident. Some things while driving need split second reactions like, someone in front of you stopping without warning abruptly or a car swerving into your lane or a person walking onto the road, if you're on your phone while driving and any of these things happen you're sure to cause an accident or even worse kill someone.

To play devil's advocate the one caveat to this essay is calling. With Aux cords in virtually in every car and Bluetooth becoming more mainstream in more recent cars, you don't need to be holding a phone to call someone. You can do it all from your steering wheel with newer cars if you get a call while driving your car will accept the call and you can talk while not even touching the phone. While aux cords aren't as good as Bluetooth there still amazing at keeping you hand free, you can just pick up your phone while its hooked up to the car and pick it up and put your phone down while talking on the phone though the car.

Texting and driving is never okay but that doesn't mean that phones should never be used while driving. There are beneficial uses of cellphones that allow drivers to get to their destination is a faster, happier way. Technology keeps advancing and is even included in newer cars or other vehicles. Not everyone has, or can afford a new car though. This means that they must rely on their phone for music, GPS, and emergency phone calls.

Music can be a big deal for drivers because in certain kinds of situations such as long drives. Long, extended drives causes drivers to not be able to focus on where they're supposed to be going, also called highway hypnosis. Music allows drivers to focus better and keep them attentive. It also keeps drivers in a good mood which causes less stress and road rage.

GPS is the most necessary reason for using a phone when the car doesn't have that kind of technology. GPS is safer than writing down directions or using a map. The driver doesn't have to look down at the phone either because most GPS services have a voice speaking out directions for them.

Sometimes drivers have absolute emergency phone calls that they must take. They don't have to put their phone up to their ear since there are other ways around it. Drivers could use the speaker option on their phone or Bluetooth. An emergency call could include calling the police for reckless drivers or crashes. Personal emergency calls include a wife going into labor or needing to take a detour to pick kids up from school.

Drivers should never text and drive, however there are still plausible uses for phones such as getting directions from GPS, listening to music as entertainment, and emergency phone calls for various reasons. Most reasons for phones are unnecessary especially with the technology provided in newer cars. If the driver has a car that has everything available, then their phone is not needed in their presence.

Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite the danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that a hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there is evidence that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving.

Opponents whose work depends on a cell phone like lawyers or businessmen say that they always have to be available to answer the phone to keep their business running. However, because of their habits, they can create dangerous and hazardous situations like a collision or an accident. Business issues can be stressful and dangerous while driving because it can cause emotional reactions that can lead to tragedy. Because of the conversation they might get upset and this can lower their driving ability that can lead to losing control over the car. So if people don't make a decision to put away their cell phones their routine can harm innocent people.

Opponents say that a hands-free set is safe because people can drive using two hands. However, hands-free devices don't cut the risk of causing an accident and even may it worsen by suggesting that the behavior is safe. Researches show that using a headset can be as dangerous as holding a phone because the conversations distract drivers from focusing on the road. Scientists had proven that people talking over the phone image of the person who they were talking to and that it doesn't interfere with driving. The problem is when a car swerves unexpectedly or pedestrians step into traffic, and the mind lacks the processing power to react in time. So the problem isn't in holding the wheel and cell phone at the same time which may cause an accident because of lack manoeuvre, it is because of conversation and lack of reaction at the particular time.

Opponents say that cell phones are good because they give an opportunity to make a call for when there is an emergency. However, it is an illusion of safety because when people need it the most either they can't find it or reach it because they are stuck in-car. People shouldn't fully depend on cell phones because they are not reliable, and the trusty solution for the difficult situation is AirIQ. AirIQ is a service that if an accident or an emergency will contact you. If you are not able to answer, they will contact the police department, hospital and fire service giving them your exact GPS location. Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are unreliable in emergency situations while AIRIQ is always ready to help you in an accident.

Concluding, if people don't give up cell-phones the number of fatalities on the roads will still increase. It is people's responsibility to not incur their own and other people's lives.

I say these three things because I agree but because it's known that everybody does this out of Bad habit, it's going to happen. An average of 62.9 percent of the world owned a cellphone in the year 2016. Cellphones and he internet is a fast growing thing these days, some people can't keep away from them, but that doesn't mean it's okay to use them while driving there's a time and a place for that. I don't agree with those that use their cellphones incorrectly while driving. Technology is growing and the world has to learn how to adapt to it in safer matters, not texting and driving or taking selfies behind the wheel. There really aren't any real good excuses for being on it all the time while driving, there's built in GPS, and Bluetooth so for those reasons I said are acceptable aren't. Maybe the if it's in your hand ticket things a little too far but safety first.

Cellphones and driving is risky and has a bad effect to the world. 1 out of 4 car accidents are caused by texting and driving in the united states. An estimated amount of 1.6million car crashes happen a year from it. Almost 390,000 injuries a year happen leaving people paralyzed when people text and drive with a high death rate. The fines and jail time aren't nice especially in bad cases. Those aren't acceptable numbers or is it worth the risk, don't expect your insurance to save you either. Please don't text and drive, be safe, and beware because your putting yourself and those around you at risk.

Cell phones have evolved in our society everyday in which case its made a huge impact in our daily lives. Technology has grown dramatically over the years. The majority of people own a cell phone in which they use on a day to day basis including while driving. Even though it is not authorized people still tend to do so. Drivers should not be able to use or operate any type of cell phones or any form of technology in which case it can be very dangerous. In our society people have been so focused on trying to do multiple things all at once that we are willing to risk our own lives and others safety.

Texting, calling or reading messages while driving can easily lead to a car crash. Keeping your eyes off the road for less than 5 seconds can cost you or somebody else's life. According to The National Safety Council states that cell phone use while driving leads up to 1.6 million crashes each year. There's actual statistics that shows that 26 percent of people driving say have admitted to texting while driving (Teens and Distracted Driving). These are just some facts that prove using your phone while driving can become a major threat to our community. Did you know that teenage drivers are four times more likely to be involved in a car crash than adult drivers? It is causing insurance to increase and causes concerns for others health.

Throughout time humans have always tried to multitask simply because nowadays in order to get a job, cook, work, or have kids you need to know how to do multiple things all at once. Yet, humans are naturally not great at multitasking. While driving your main priority is to focus on driving and just driving; if people were actually good at multitasking than ""texting while driving"" rates of deaths wouldn't be extremely high as it is now. According to American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) traffic crashes are the #1 cause of death and injury for people ages 16-20, with more than 5,600 teens dying in motor vehicle collisions each year. While being behind the wheel you need to be inventive, always look at your surroundings, all mirrors, and everywhere.

Texting while driving is threatening because you see it all the time yet, people still don't change their bad habits. If it wasn't harmless than there would've been any commercials of people getting into car crashes on the television nor either any signs stating ""no texting while driving."" The rates of using a cellular device are so high that statistics show that driving while texting is six times more dangerous than drunk driving. The U.S. bans text messaging. There are three main types of distractions which are visual, manual, and cognitive. Texting while driving uses all three of these distractions in which it will cost you a life including jail time all because humans can't put the phone down for a few minutes. The U.S. bans text messaging so don't even try to do it.

In conclusion, humans should not be able to use a cell phone in any capacity while operating a motor vehicle. Simple facts and statistics show us textual evidence in how texting while driving is life threatening. As we know, numbers don't lie. There over 1 million car crashes each year; not only that but we live it everyday and watch how innocent lives are taken away day by day because of cellular devices. Save a life. It can most definitely wait. A life is not worth a text or a call.

A39AA3DF5E2C,"what do you think about smartphones? Smartphones make it easy for us to be connected with friends and family through phone calls, text messages, etc. How do you feel about the use of cellphones while driving? Well, about 660,000 drivers attempt using a cellphone while operating a vehicle. Rates for cell phone distractions are extremely high. Do you think that it would be okay to use cellphones while driving? I feel that people shouldn't use their phones while driving because it affects their ability to drive, causes car accidents and people die.

People's driving could easily be affected by the use of a cell phone. It can be a distraction physically and cognitively. The physical distraction occurs when they are using the cellphone while driving their vehicle. Cognitive distraction occurs when drivers give their attention to the phone instead of the road. However, the ability to give your attention to both of these tasks are limited.

Statistics show that driving and using a cellphone is more common for which can be very dangerous. According to ""National Safety Council, 1.6 million car crashes each year. 341,000 involved text messaging, and 1.2 million involed drivers talking on the phone. The statistics show that this multitasking while operating a vehicle is becoming life threatening. Research from ""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)""

says, teens who do not frequently use a phone while driving believe the benefits of putting away their phone while driving outweigh any throwbacks. If they don't use their phones they would be able to pay attention to driving, be less likely to have a crash, most importantly, they would be following the law.

Car crashes end up causing very fatal injuries and death. Driving while texting is 6 times more likely to cause car crashes than driving while intoxicated. There are nearly 390,000 injuries caused by texting and driving yearly. Approximately 6,000 people were killed by texting and driving in the past year. Checking a text takes 5 seconds of a driver's attention away from driving when they could be used on the road.

Overall, I feel that using a cellphone while driving shouldn't be allowed because it causes car accidents affects driving and kills people. 1.6 million car accidents, 1 out of 4 of them yearly involves texting while driving. This could be changed. Limit your cellphone use. Just think how many lives can be saved. Think of the car crash rate, they will dwindle. Before driving and after check your phone. You'll be focused on the road instead of fidgeting with a cellphone.                                                ",5,Phones and driving,Independent
FEA516299C94,"People use their cell phones for just about everything such as: texting, talking, schedule planning, internet surfing, etc. People are also choosing the wrong time to be using their cell phones: while they are driving. As a society, we have become so focused on how much we can do at one time that we are willing to risk our personal safety as well as the safety of others because we can't put down our cell phones.

Drivers preoccupied by non-driving activities are prone to causing an accident. Therefore, the use of cell phones has been one of the main contributors to car accidents. However, many States have rightfully stopped local governments from prohibiting cell phone use by motorist, and they have enforced strict rules to control their usage. For example, driving a state vehicle a person can be terminated if caught texting and talking on a cell phone. The National Safety Council also estimates that in a recent year, 21% of vehicular crashes (1,100,000) involved talking on either a handheld or hands free cell phone. About 6,000 deaths and a half a million injuries are caused by distracted drivers every year.

If you are driving at 55mph for 5 seconds in that amount of time you could cross a football field. People don't understand how dangerous distracted driving really is. All states should have some sort of legal parameters of what happens when you get caught using your cell phone while driving. Drinking while driving laws are much harsher than distracted driving. The Arizona state laws states: "" if you are under the age of 21 any trace of alcohol, illegal drugs or drugs that impair your ability to drive safely will result in stiff penalties and your license will be suspended for two years."" As you can see the laws have bigger consequences.

a good alternative to prevent cell phone distraction would be to put the phone in the glove compartment. Relevant phone messages can always be retrieved after you arrive at your destination. some people might say that banning cell phone usage while driving is similar to banning a person from tuning the radio or lighting a cigarette while driving. Tuning the radio or lighting a cigarette does not require deep concentration for most people.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent
122C6BBF0E91,"Cell Phones haven't been around a long time, so people think they are the best thing yet. People use phones for everything. Surprisingly people are using them at the wrong times, causing car accidents and other accidents. Driving while texting or even talking sometimes on the phone is not safe at all. All of this makes it extremely hard to focus on the road and your surroundings.

Therefore, since driving and texting is illegal, and people still do it, there are now fines and tickets people have to pay if they are caught or even suspected to be on their phone while driving. Most drivers cannot maintain the same speed when they aren't focused on the road so the other drivers will either be so close to them or get mad and speed around them. There have been reports of 36% of drivers who admit to being on their phones while driving. 14% of that 36% ended up in a deadly wreck.

In conclusion, I think it is best to stay off your phone while driving. This could save so many lives of innocent people. This would also save so much time and money that cops and ambulances have to put into coming to help someone who should've just followed the laws to begin with.   ",3,Phones and driving,Independent

Billions of people throughout the world are using cell phones in daily routine life. Cell phones provide communication with greater flexibility. It is, nowadays considered less fashion and more a utility providing several benefits. Cell phones have different features in addition to communication including cameras, video games, music, FM receivers etc. Cell phones not only facilitate business and personal convenience they also provide comfort and safety. However, observations, experience, and studies all have highlighted the dangerous effects of using cell phones during driving, strictly unadvisable, and an illegal matter. The major drawback of using cell phones during driving is that it distracts attention of driver. (Scotti, 2007)

There are number of traditional ways that distracts driver's attention. They include talking to passengers, lighting and smoking a cigarette, eating, drinking etc. It is pertinent to mention that attention of driver distracted through cell phones means driving and communicating at the same time that increases threats to safety. Furthermore, drivers has also to operate both, vehicle and cell phone, simultaneously, that also distract attention leading to dangerous accidents, and in some cases resulting in death of driver and passengers. In other words, cell phones reduce driver's performance. (Gravelle, 2005)

Despite offering huge benefits, cell phones have become a grave concern and a major cause of road accidents. Drivers using cell phones are not able to give their complete attention on roads exposing not only themselves but also other people on the road. Therefore, most of the governments, including Austria, Australia, Switzerland, Greece, Germany, and different Asian as well as African countries, have imposed restriction on using cell phones during driving.

Because of diversion in attention drivers reacts slowly to the traffic signals, missing them at times. Decision making during driving is a critical factor giving drivers fraction of a second to make a swift decision about a given complex scenario. Studies have highlighted those drivers using cell phones react slowly and often make wrong decision causing serious accidents involving other vehicles also. (Gravelle, 2005)

Drivers demonstrates comparatively slower braking responses and also had low awareness of other traffic flowing through the roads ignoring their presence concentrating more on cell phones and less on roads as how other drivers are behaving. Different studies have reported hundreds of deaths during a year because of using cell phones during driving.

Increased Chances of Fatal Accidents

Several researchers have proved that using cell phones during driving makes driver more exposed to fatal accidents. Focus of the driver is not on the road or traffic and it becomes difficult to handle phone and vehicle at one time. Cell phones during driving also reduce the mental capacity of drivers as they fail to concentrate on minor or major activities happening around them. As already discussed, cell phones distract drivers' attention resulting in comparatively slow response to traffic signals and other related traffic events. Studies have shown the fact that breaking reaction time is also slower while talking on a cell phone during driving. The perception, vision, general awareness, and concentration of the driver are impacted while communicating on a cell phone during driving. Especially during bad weather or driving on slippery roads, drivers engage in conversation pay less attention to these areas increasing risks of fatal accidents. (Gravelle, 2005)

The main advantage to avoid using cell phone during driving is ensuring safety of driver, vehicle, and other people driving on the road. By making conversation, writing messages, or just playing with the mobile increases the chances of accidents. It is pertinent to highlight that hands-free phones have also similar negative impacts during driving; both distracts attention, although hands-free cell phones do not require manual handling. (Sturnguist, 2006)

The nature of conversation on cell phones during driving differs and can have distinctive impacts on drivers. The complexity of conversation draws more attention of drivers, while simple or casual conversation is less distracting, however, both may produce same consequences. As such, the more complex a situation is higher are chances of distraction that presents a threat to road safety. (Klein, 2000)

Cell phone users while driving has low level of perceptions. There exists a direct relationship between perception and performance of a driver. Distracted attention results in low perception of the driver reducing performance levels. A major strength of driving skills is a pro-active approach anticipating actions of other drivers and making adjustments accordingly. However, a driver busy in conversation on a cell phone is unable to adopt a pro-active approach and it becomes almost impossible to anticipate other person's attitude as well as behavior. The consciousness of events happening around vehicle has a huge impact on driving. It is necessary for the drivers to monitor outside events and their possible impacts on driving. Using cell phones make it difficult to keep an eye on the outside events. Negligent behavior is highly immoral and unethical as it exposes human lives to a huge threat of accidents that could ultimately lead even to death. (Gravelle, 2005)

Some Benefits of Cell Phones during Driving

Although, there are grave negative impacts of using cell phones during driving it is pertinent, for the sake of arguments, to present benefits also. The most important benefit of cell phones during driving is again the security factor. During emergency situations cell phones can provide help and driver can make emergency calls, even reporting any dangerous scenario such as roadside accidents. Through cell phones a driver can locate the desired route. Furthermore, using FMs on cell phones can provide information about weather and traffic. (Sturnguist, 2006)

Conclusion

The paper has presented arguments on both sides of the issue using or not using cell phones during driving. On the basis of arguments presented in the paper, it can be concluded that despite an effective way of communication, using cell phones during driving distracts attention of driver increasing road safety concerns.

Cell phone usage while driving isn't very safe at all. When you are using it, you aren't really paying attention to the road. It's a safety hazard with a lot of people driving and using their phone. In the united states alone, just fifteen years ago, there were only 4.3 million people that use cell phones. Today there are 224 million people that use them as of now. Your cell phone gets used everywhere you go such as the shopping and trying to find the item you need or even when you are making a list to go to the store to buy school supplies. People talk on their phones everyday while they drive or even around the house to keep in contact with others.

In several cases, drivers have been in a lot of accidents and it's been, because of their cell phone and people sue either you or your insurance company depending on the accident and what happens. People also have been held liable for the accidents involving their phone, because they were the one that wasn't paying attention and was distracted. Cells are convenient for people, but they don't know how to properly use them. Begin on your phone is so dangerous and people need to understand it's not really that important to be on your phone while you're driving unless something is really wrong then you need to pull over and find out what's going on.

In the united states they have a law called ""hands free"". When your being on your phone while your driving is a distraction that lead to fatal consequences. The consequences aren't normally very good, because when an accident happens and you were on your phone you can be sued very badly and you'll probably be in trouble and struggle with money. Its best if all drivers will stay off their phones while they drive. In the end of the day there are a lot of people dying in accidents, because of distracted drivers. So always pay attention to the road while you're driving and don't be on your phone.

In the end its always smart to not be on your phone while you drive. Use your phone when you at a complete stop or if it's safe to. If everyone would work on this the accident percentage wouldn't be so high in the united states.                  ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

90BC4A0EDED0,"Imagine checking the notification of your cell phone and in the blink of an eye you get into a car accident.Texting and driving is the act of texting, checking social media, composing a message,emailing, or using the internet while driving a vehicle.Texting and driving is an issue that has resulted in car crashes and even death. Picking up a phone while you are behind the wheel could put yourself and others in danger. People should be cautious and know the risk of picking up a cell phone while they are driving.Cell phones have become and is a very big distraction. Drivers should not be able to use them or even have them in their hand,lap, or etic while they are in the act of operating a vehicle.

The cell phone has become so much of a distraction to the point where people are immune to picking up their phone every time they receive a notification. The disturbance of a notification on the phone has been the cause of man accidents and deaths caused by car wrecks. Statistics show 6 out of 10 teenegers have been in car crashes due to distracted driving. In the text located on www.teensafe.com it shares the story of 25 year old Natasha Boggs of Ohio and how texting and driving affected her life and others. It states "" Ohio woman Natasha Boggs, 25, killed two 14-year-old girls and severely injured a 15-year-old boy when she was texting and driving.""The article also tells the story of 20 year old Dillon Jackson a pickup truck driver that was distracted by his cell phone which took other innocent lives. The text states ""A driver of a pickup truck killed a whopping 13 individuals in a Texas crash in the spring of 2017. 20-year-old Jack Dillon Young was behind the wheel of his truck and was texting while driving, causing him to cross the center line several times.""

This informs you on how cell phone distraction could risk the lives of not only yourself but others as well. ? people are injured or killed due to cell phone distraction. Cell phone disturbances have a big impact on car crashes and deaths.

Cell phone distractions are very dangerous when someone is operating a vehicle. Distracted driving can include things like eating, drinking, talking to others while driving, and etc. Out of all those distractions cell phone interaction is the most common and dangerous. When paying attention to your cell phone it takes away the attention you need to focus on the road and drive safely. In a text on www.wikepedia.com it says "" Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes."" This simply means that the use of the cell phone while driving can result in a dangerous outcome. It is also said that ""4.6 secondspass when a driver's eyes leave the road to text at 55mph, it's like driving the length of a football field blind."" When a driver's eye is taken off the road the chance of wrecking another car or even running off the side of the road and harming yourself. The dangerous outcomes could be losing control of the wheel, crashing, running off the side of the road, harming others of all ages, running into objects ( poles, signs,cines,etc.), and the worst of all, death. Cell phone disturbance can be very dangerous when driving which is another cell phone should not be used while driving.

People should consider certain things before picking up a phone. Things can be done to lower the accidents caused by the distraction of a cell phone. Companies have taken a huge step to decrease the number of wrecks caused by phones.Cell phone companies such as AT&T realized how big cell phones are distractions to drivers so they come up with programs. For example, a big program today is "" It could wait "". On the site www.independentmotors.com it describes the can wait program. It quotes ""AT&T itself has helped drive these conversations with its It Can Wait campaign, which has seen more than 7 million people take the campaign's pledge to drive more safely. The company also launched its DriveMode app, which keeps all phone calls and texts quiet while you are driving. The app turns on automatically when it detects that the user is moving faster than 15 MPH and turns off shortly after it detects that the user has stopped.""

This shows how companies have noticed the danger of cell phones and have taken action onto fixing it such just like AT&T which is a huge cell phone company. Another program example is the Stop Texting AND Driving Distracted, or STANDD program. This program was launched by a lady who lost her son due to a texting a driving incident . The website states "" Like a few other organizations on this list, STANDD has its own app for iOS and Android smartphones. It starts up as soon as your engine does, and as long as you're moving more than 10 miles per hour, the free app deactivates any texts and calls that you receive, letting the caller know that you're unavailable with an auto-message."". This goes to show that there are ways to put an end to all the horrible incidents caused by texting and driving but it is all up to you. Programs have been made, apps have been released, and signs are around you everyday to remind you not to text and drive so do what's best and focus more on the road and not on your phone.

A simple message or text could wait. If people paid as much attention to the roads than their phones there would be less wrecks or car tragedies. Cell phones are huge distractions on drivers. Drivers are put in harm once they pick up their phones to check a text, post on social media, change songs, make videos, and etc. Cell phones while driving is like taking a risk. People are put in life or death situations once being distracted by their phones when operating a vehicle. In conclusion the use of cell phones should be prohibited while driving.

DBD87F1C44C6,"Today the majority of people use cell phones on a daily basis. Some of us just can't put them down, not even when it can cause other people to be unsafe. We use them from when we wake up to when we finally go to sleep. But is there a time that we shouldn't be on our cell phones? When we're driving it is never a good idea to be on your phone.

The reason that its a bad idea to be on your phone during driving is that it takes away your attention from the road. Driving is already a multitasking operation. We have to balance our speed, gas level, directions, music, air conditioning, and other drivers. The last thing we need is another thing to focus on, especially an entertainment device that we already struggle to put down. All cell phones do for drivers is add another thing to focus on, and the list of things for drivers to focus on is already too long.

Another reason not to allow phones in the hands of drivers is that, although distraction is a large issue, even if you argue that you can pay attention and multitask well enough, your reaction time is still slowed. It has been proven that multitasking lowers a person's ability to act efficiently. This also applies to driving. Not only do you run the risk of missing a turn or passing that restaurant that you were looking for, you run a very large risk of not reacting soon enough to a distracted driver, running off of the road, and rear ending a stopping car. Your slowed reaction time is a very large issue when using cell phones while driving.

The reasons for not using cell phones while driving are very compelling and should not be taken lightly. Many people lose their lives every year due to distracted driving. It is important to stay very focused and aware while driving. Do not risk your safety or someone else's due to cell phone usage while driving.   ",4,Phones and driving,Independent

Distractions can serve as a curse and a blessing. Not giving full attention to what we should be doing makes us miss deadlines, fail classes and crash into other drivers. Distractions sure comes with a price! Mobile phone use while driving is a particularly important form of driver distraction. It can increase the risk of traffic accidents by up to four times.

Our brains have a limited ability to focus. We can't pay attention to everything around us at once so we must choose what to focus on. For instance, while driving we are supposed to keep our eye on the road , but as soon as our phones chime the brain automatically wants to check the phone ,taking your focus off the road and to the distraction which can cause you to crash into other drivers. Due to our brains ability to focus on one thing at a time NO driver should be allowed to have a mobile device while driving a motor vehicle.

Talking on a cell phone may be less distracting than some other activities people may engage in while driving. Sadly, some people still don't get this one. Alcohol has an effect on your motor skills and judgment, meaning you just simply just cannot drive and be intoxicated at the same time .Research shows an increased risk of death for drivers who have been distracted by their phones checking or sending social media posts takes eyes and brains off the task of driving. Even though phones can cause a distraction your focus should be on the road. Therefore, drivers should not be allowed to use phones or be under any kind of influence while driving.

To conclude, no drivers should be allowed to have an operating mobile device while driving simply because your brain won't be able to process a car and a phone at the same time. Driving can be dangerous business. Every year, a shocking number of people lose their life or are severely injured while traveling in vehicles. Leave your phone in your pocket or purse and take it out once the car is stopped. Save your life and the text.         ",4,Phones and driving,Independent
