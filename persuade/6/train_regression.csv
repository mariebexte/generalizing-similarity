For explain, in paragaph 1 it say that ""Venus is simple to see from distant but safe vanage point of earth, it has proves a very challenging place to examine more closely "" its is ever challenging visting, trying to do go and rescreach on a plant where you dont know anything about it.

Venus is the twin of earth, right around the corner. In the pharagh 2, it say, ""humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world."" Every previous mission was unmanned. You may be asking yourself why , because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours . They belived thats why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus. Its a really challeng for plant for human to study.

One of the challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acis in Venus atmosphere. On planets surface, temperatures avarage over 800 degrees , and the atompheric average 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar systems.

Let me tell you this , long ago Venus was probably covered largely with and COULD

have supported various froms of life, just like Earth.

Venus can be save to resreach but what person would want to do at ?

5E59446378D4,"""Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". Studying Venus is a worthy worth wild task despite the dangers that it involves. There are many positive things that may come out of exploring our dear neighbor Venus inlcluding how it might have once been just like Earth.

Venus was once just like earth researchers have found many Earth like evidence to support this claim. Venus may have been fillwed with oceans once just like how we have them here. This planet may have had various form of life whether it be the tiniest things. Today there is still much evidence that can give off it has Earth type atmosphere. Such as the rocky sediments, the valleys, and the mountains. This way if we were to pursuit Venus we could cope with what we already know on about our planet Earth and how we have similar structures. It would be a worthy idea also because they have volcanoes and earthquakes some things we on earth have as well. We would be able to do this and discover if Venus was just like Earth.

Venus can be a worthy pursuit because since it is not a far away planet we would be able to travel their with an advantage of it being close to Earth. Going to Venus would also be a the nearest option for a planetary visit as well. With not a single spacecraft touching Venus in 3 decades going back and replanning the visit to Venus would be a mega shock to others. Like as said in the paragraph Venus is around the same size and density of Earth so this would give our fellow space people a similarity of what Earth is like but in hotter and a bit more extreme troposphere.

With the improvement of technology we could have spacecrafts succefully land on Venus surface. Giving technology an area to expand as well this can also see what technology can do for us more in the future. NASA has been working on a electronic that could stay up till three weeks in the tempature of what Venus approxiametly is which is around eight-hundred degrees fahrenheit. This could give us the chance to send a spacecraft to Venus and see what we could find that relates to things here in Earth. So, yeah technology is a big part of this pursuit.

Wrapping it up the pursuit to Venus would be challenging but we could soon enough get there. The positive things and the excitement of what Venus may contain makes this something worthy of going and exploring what Venus has for us. There are some dangerous things about it such as the hot tempature but with the right technology I believe it is a worthy trip. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

Venus may be very cool looking and theres so much to learn about it; things you might of not of known. It may be to impossible to tavel to this planet, there are to many dangerous things that happen and it would not be safe. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author supports their idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author gives so much information about Venus and the dangers, and to study it than to visit the planet is safer.

Even though Venus looks very cool looking and fun to learn about, well it is, but it would not be safe to travel to Venus. The author in this article gives a lot of information about venus such as, the goods and the bads, and why and why not one should travel to that planet. In the aticle ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author states, ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system."" Venus is dangerous, it is very hot and has the hottest surface out of all the planets. The author supports their suggestion by putting out there the fact of how hot Venus is, and that studying Venus is a worthly pursuit.

Venus looks very cool and most people wish they could travel there, but it wouldn't be such a good idea. Venus is very dangerou in many ways and you wouldn't be able to be by it in a spaceship, it's far from fun to visit. Studying Venus gives you a lot more information then to visit and might be able to make it back.

7831B697E6BF,"How well did the author of ""The Chalenge of Exploring Venus"" support and articulate their ideas? The paper was okay at best. I found there was a lack of supporting evidence in some instances, and that they didn't fully articulate the answer of ""why are scientists even discussing furthur visits to its surface"" in paragraph four.

Lack of evidence. The author seemed to lack evidence for a few of their claims. In paragraph seven, the author stated that mechanical computers are more durable than electronic ones. They gave no sitation, or evidence. This lead me to question its authenticity, and this arose questions of why it is better or worse. Evidence of why mechanical computers are more durable would have helped to get an idea of what the author was tryig to explain. Understanding what makes them more resistant to heat, or acids, or other forces. Fully explaining your ideas is a fundimental piece of a good essay.

In this passage the question kept coming up as to why scientists wanted to further explore Venus. In paragraph four the author beggs the same question, but it seems as though they got sidetracked in there responce, and compleatly forgot to explain it. The author states in responce to the question in paragraph four ""Astronomers are facinated by Vens because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" The author then goes on about the similarities between them, but never explain why exactly scientists are interested in further studies. Is it to see if Earth could become a hot sulferic planet like venus, or to figure out more about how life is created under specific conditions? If a question is proposed you need to answer it, otherwise it may discourage the reader from reading more of your work, and leave them confused.

Together these two things can really effect the product of your essay in a negitive way. These may make your essay look amature, or even just make it a bad essay. Though I enjoyed reading this, and I found it interesting, these thimgs made this essay feel weaker, and had the author included more evidence, or fully articulated their ideas, this essay would have been much better.

Despite it not being safe to be on he tells they have a blimp-like vehicle to hover over it he also that even on the vehicle the temputures can still reach up 170 degrees fahrenheit. And they would travel 30 miles hovering above its has alot of storms lighting often his the surface and the air is completely filled with carbon dixode . He infers they collect samples of rock ,gas and anything else in the distance.

He tells how NASA made eletronics made from silicon carbide and tested them in a chamber to simulate the chaos if you were to touch venus's surface by foot. These inventions only lasted 3 weeks in these harsh conditions. Also they made another project using old mechanical computers they were first envisoned in the 1800s and they had a big role in the 1940s during world war II . Sciencetist thought the computers would act up but they made caluclations by using gears and levers

0A6E7B9813A4,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is able to suggest and back up their claim of Venus being a worthy pursuit despite it's dangers by stating facts showing how science and technology will help us in the pursuit of exploring to Venus. They gets us concerned by stating the perrils of exploring venus. Then they state why the audience should be interested in exploring Venus, and proceeds to counter the perrils by stating technological advancements being made to lessen the extreme environment on Venus.

The author shows the perrils by first stating the dangers and compare them to intense atmospheres on Earth, such as how the ground temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees fahrenheit and would instantly melt most metals. Another example that he gives would be when they states that the gravitational pull of Venus would crush a submarine that was meant to explore the deepest depths of the ocean at Earth. One more example of this would be when says that staying above it is still a danger because of how hot and unbearable it would be. Those are the situations that he has listed.

After saying all the dangers of exploring Venus the author decides to mention why scientists are still attempting to explore the dangerous planet. An example would be that Venus is very much like Earth. In the article the author mentions Venus and Earth having many of the same features, such as mountains and valleys as well as evidence showing Venus possibly containing water and oceans. Another thing the author tells us is that the planets orbit at different times, so at times Earth may be closest to Venus, and other times we are closer to Mars. Those are all reasons why scientists wish to explore Venus further.

The author, after having told us the conditions and reasons to explore Mars goes further. The author then states technological advancements being made to help survive the conditions on Venus to obtain samples and such. An example the author gives us would be mentioning A device that would lessen the conditions on Venus to make it at least tolerable. Another example would be creating a lab that would create the same atmosphere as venus so scientists could create machines capable of surviving the harsh environment. Those are all examples stated in the text.

After stating the perils, the motivations, and the advancements towards Venus, the author is able to canvey their message in a clear and concise way. The evidence used to back up their claims are able to show how important Venus is to Scientists and mankind alike. Venus should be further explored despite have harsh conditions because it's the closest thing to Earth. There are also technological advancements being made to adapt to Venus in order to possibly inhabit Venus.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
C2C8EF16FBDA,"Studying Venus can be dangerous but,there are some times where it's not dangerous. Venus is the second planet from the solar system. No spaceship has landed on Venus for decades. Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Astronomers have been intreaged by Venus by looking like an Earth-like planet.

Venus was covered with oceans a long time ago. Venus has rocky sediment which are valleys,mountains,and craters. NASA has an idea by sending by sending humans to study Venus. Venus has a ground condition that is 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Air pressure in Venus is kinda close to the sea level on Earth.

Venus has a dense atmosphere and you can't see it with light. Researchers can't take samples of rock,gas,or anything else. Researchers see taking risks as challenges. Researchers are using machines to study Venus to know the knowledge of Venus. The machines are made out of silicon carbide.

The machines has lasted 3 weeks. NASA has another project called mechanical computers which is old technology. They're first envisioned in the 1800s. In the 1940s,it played an important role during World War ll. Those kinds of computers used to exist in those days.

In conclusion,its still ok to go to Venus. Venus has a lot of similarities to Earth. Venus is not dangerous. Even though it has hot temperature,its still good. Astronauts can go to Venus.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
AB34D8C23C7F,"The author thinks that Venus is a worthy pursuit to discover and explore. It would be a worthy goal for humans to evolve and grow as a species and to understand that we're able to understand how to universe works. The author does claim that the study of Venus is important and that we should take the time to study and understand it better.

The first thing the author mentions about this is in paragraph four. In this paragraph the author talks about how astronomers are fascinated by Venus. He says, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". This quote shows that the author suggest that Venus could be a good thing to explore to understand the solar system better and understand how Earth conditions could form on other planets. This was the first part of the text the author showed his support towards studying Venus. The next point he supports his idea is in paragraph eight. In this paragraph the author explains that striving to get a challange what humans do. They work through chalanges to evolve as a species. This is seen when the author says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gainedon the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". This quote from the author is to show that he supports exploring Venus because it could provide humans with new knowledge that we prevoiusly didn't have and that new knowledge could help us overcome challenges in the future like new spacetravel and solar colonization attempts.

All of these things the author provides allow humans to discover ideas and inventions they have yet to discover. And expand the mindset to a more univerisal understanding way. The author wants hmuanity to take this experience because we may have to deal with something like it again. When getting to a space age humans will need to know more about the space they're trying to colonize.

The author has supported hs claim on Venus being a worthy challange for humans to occupy their minds and abilities. Trying to overcome this challange will provide us with new information that could help in the future of the race and of furthur understanding of the universe. Would help us learn to colonize the stars and to understand how different types of planets are formed, allowing use to understand the universe we live in better than we currently do.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
B99C94EDFA6A,"The planet Venus may be one of our most valuable assets to understand our planet, but Venus has some dangers we cannot ignore. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does a good job of suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite it's dangers by explaining the value of exploring Venus, the dangers, and how the dangers may be overcome.

Venus is very similar to Earth, sharing approximate densities and sizes. The planet also shares geographical features with Earth, such as rocky sediment, craters, and mountains. It is possible that hundreds of years ago Venus really might have been the twin planet to Earth. Astronomers have reason to beleive that Venus was home to oceans and various life forms. If we learn more about this planet, we could find the key to unlock the knowledge of how our home planet works. This supports the author's claim that we must study Venus further by providing reasons knowledge of Venus would directly affect everyday life on Earth.

The author also uses the possible dangers of exploring Venus to explain why we must pursue Venus, through all the challenges. Venus has a heavy atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide, making it impossible for humans to breathe freely on the planet. The pressure on Venus is so great that a person would be crushed, not to mention the extreme temperatures over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit. It would be impossible for an astronaut to explore on the planet's surface without proper technology. Adding to the already intense conditions, Venus has volcanoes, eartquakes, and frequent lightning, which present their own problems. The dangers help prove the author's point that even though dangerous, we must explore Venus.

The author describes possible solutions created by NASA to show that it will be possible to explore Venus, even with the dangers. NASA has proposed an idea of humans studying Venus from a vehicle hovering the planet, but this would not be optimal because the exploration would be very limited. Viewing Venus from thirty feet above would be better than no exploration at all and would create livable conditions, so it is a relatively safe option for gathering knowledge on the planet. Another idea is using mechanical computers on Venus. The computers can make calculations, without electronics. These computers are also more likely to withstand the extreme conditions of Venus, unlike modern computers. No plan can be one hundred percent safe, especially in a danger zone like Venus, but the benefits outweigh the risks. The author does a proficient job of portraying this in the article.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author presents the idea that Venus should be studyed intently, despite the risks. The author does a good job of explaining this by telling how we could benefit from knowledge of Venus, telling the dangers, and solutions to overcome the dangers of Venus.

467D74208AE9,"The author is definetley fond of studying Venus and different ways to get there. The author goes into detail on how Venus is a very different but at the same time similar to Earth's atmosphere. The problem is that there has not been a single succesful mission to Venus, which means scientists have no concrete evidence that humans can survive there.

The author stated, ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anyhting else, from a distance""(6). This is very important because if the scientists can not take samples then no one will be able to figure out if humans could actually survive on Venus. The sooner scientists get to test the surface of Venus, the sooner humans will find out if they are able to live on Venus in the future. Venus is similar to Earth for a few reassons for example, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth""(4). This quote is discussing that Venus was once the most Earth like planet because they both had very similar atmospheres and features. As the quote mentioned Venus was covered largely with oceans, Earth is 70% + covered in ocean. If signs of life on Earth are possible from having many oceans it is logical to predict that Venus had life in it's oceans at one time.

In conclusion, It is still a problem that there has not been one succesful mission to Venus, resulting in scientists having no concrete evidence that humans could survive on Venus in the future. Once there is an invention that allows scientists to get to Venus's surface and take samples. It will be a quick process from there to find out if humans can survive on Venus's atmosphere. The fact that scientists have found that Venus once had a lot of space covered in oceans. This can help one predict that there was also some living organisms on Venus's surface. If the conditions are still the same scientists could test the area to figure out if it would be possible for humans to live there in the future.   ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
731BDB9899E5,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because it could become our new home. Venus is often referred as Earth's twin, as it's similar in density and size, and the closest in distance to Earth. Humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on Venus and were unmaned for a good reason as the spacecrafts can only survive for a few hours after landing. The planet Venus is challenging to study but we humans want to learn more about it. Venus was once an Earth like planet, can be the nearest option for a planetary visit, and be studied with new ideas.

Venus was once an Earth like planet in our solar system. Venus was probably covered largely with oceans long ago. The planet Venus would have most likely been able to support life. Today, Venus still has some analogous feature like valleys, mountains, and craters. As though Venus was a Earth like planet and no longers supports life it still is a planet that scientist want to study. As the knowledge of this planet is unknown.

Venus can be our first planetary visit in the near future. NASA has a compelling idea for sending scientist to study Venus, NASA is thinking of scientist to float above the fray. They are thinking of having a blimp-like vehicle to hover above 30 or so miles in the roiling Venusian. A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the dangerous ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. Although these is an option it would be difficult to study venus as most light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere and scientist can't go down there and get rock samples.

Venus is an interesting planet to study but it will be difficult to even see the surface. NASA is trying to study Venus by using simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber that simulates the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for about three weeks. Another project that will allow the study of Venus is looking back at old technology called mechanical computers, this devices were envisioned in the 1800s and were used during World War II. Those computers uses gears and levers to make calculations and don't require electronics. Mechanical parts are more resistent to pressure, heat, and other forces. This ideas can be used to study the planet Venus.

Venus is worthy of been studied as it resembles Earth in many ways and the closest to us. Venus is similar in density and size and has similarities to Earth. As humans sent numerous unmanned spacecrafts they have only lasted a few hours after their landing. As we humans want to study the planet Venus we come up with ideas to study it. Although Venus is the closest our knowledge is very little but we know it was once an Earth like planet that could have supported life.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
88142980CC06,"In this article we can see that the author give us many reason's why venus can be a awesome and bad star . The author says that Venus , sometimes is called ""Evening Star,"" and that is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. However, that nickname is misleading since Venus is actually a planet. In the solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun. Other people refer to venus as the tein of the Earth because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in the distance too. Earth,Venus,and Mars, our other planetary neighbor,orbit the sun at the different speeds. These differences in speed means that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to venus. The author says because Venus is sometmes right around the corner-in space terms - Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus . After they saw that no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. They think that the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.

On the planet's surface , the temperatures are over 800 degrees Fahreheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth.

The planet is strangly reffered to ""Earth's twin"", today it might not hold Earth's qualities, but long ago it was beilieved it did. Scientist's are set to beileve that at one point Venus had oceans and a possinble life sorce. A time before the extreme weather conditions, Venus is said to have flourished with oceans, supporting various forms of life, like Earth today. Now, that is long gone, taken over by a volcanic terrain. Exploring Venus will be dangerous and worth all the odds against it.

We, as humans, have already tried to explore the dangerous planet before. Each mission has been unmanned as no spacecraft has even survived the landing for more than a few hours. Nasa is now working on other approaches to studying Venus. One project being conducted states ""having simplified electrons made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.""

We will see with the author´s text how Venus is a worthy planet to visit even with the kind of dangers that are possible to happen in Venus.

First of all Venus is a very hard place to review and investigate deeply. In the text we can see that Venus is in a first look inhospitable, 97 percent of its atmosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide, clouds are highly corrosive, the planet´s surface temperature average is 800 Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather than Earth´s pressure. That is something that used to be different in the past where Venus looked like Earth´s enviroment. There used to be mountains, valleys, oceans etc. But all these impediments gets underpreciated when our curiosity grows each day, and in the text we can find the first steps of something that once used to be impossible to think and that´s a correct expedition to Venus. The NASA is looking for a way to send humans to study Venus. This way is to float above Venus. Conditions there are more survivable for humans. The pressure is a lot less, and radiaton levels is not greater than Earth´s radiation, the temperature is considerably lower than the surface temperature. Some scientific advantages have to be completed to at least have a safe investigation expedition such as in photography or video cameras because of low light levels in Venus. Samples of materials can´t be taken either from a far distance and Venus difficult enviroment. The author is convinced that some day the human will be able to do a research in Venus and its convincement is reflected on how he wrote the 6th paragraph where the author says, ""Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to las long enought to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" is giving a small amount of hope to keep track in the research of new technologies to have the key to travel Venus and explore it.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

The author provides alot of information that you will probably be suprised about for example did you know that the tmpatures are over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric prssure is 90 times greater than we on earth experience. meaning its way too hot, then here in earth. Unlike planet Mecury which is closer to the sun. Venus is more likely to experince impediments for example erupting volcanoes , earthquakesand mostly lightning strikes and land on its surface.

Venus still has surface of rocky sediment and also include familiar features just as earth like valleys ,moutains, and craters. Imporantly researchers cannot take swamples of rock , gas or anything but from a distance , therefore scienctist seek through mission to understand Venus. Venus tend to be more delicate when it comes to physical conditions as the example the author uses ""just imagin exposing a cell phone or tablet to heat of melting tin"" the author here is trying to get your attention and make you think about it and have you wondering what would happen if you wer too expose someting like that to heat.

In conclusion studying a planet is not bad nor is dangered to anyone unless you are going pshically there. So therefore the author is telling you its a good idea to study about Venus andf meet new information about the planet.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
1B8D0107E4CB,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author saying that many people are very interested in discovering Venus because it's very similar to Earth. But this planet is also a challenging place to examine closely. With thick atmosphere, high temperatures, and the atmospheric pressure is greater than Earth, no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. That making it difficult for humans to discover it.

The author supports the idea of how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is pretty well. Because he had good evidences and details answering the questions. The text states,""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This shows how well the author supported the ideas about studying Venus.

Venus is a dangerous place for humans to visit and examine. But it's worth once you tried it. Many people are interested in Venus and wanted to study more about it in the future. The author did a good passage to supported his ideas about Venus. With many helpful evidences and details.  ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

Scientist would mostly consider Venus because they feel like it is more controlable than Mars. On the planet's surface on Venus is that they have an average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and pressure 90 times grater than what we experience(paragraph 3). These are verry high temperature and pressure for humans to encounter on earth, even if humans ever went to live on Venus, such an environment would crush our society in the deepest parts of the ocean and would liquefy many metals(paragraph 3). Beyond that high pressures of heat impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface, such weather like that can kill more than one hundred humans a day. Scientist and astronomers said that, "" long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans, mountains, craters, an valleys just like earth""(paragraph 4). NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray, just imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 0r so miles above the landscape on Venus(paragraph 5). They also said that the temperatures would be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrengeit and the temperaute would still be at close to that sea level on earth.

In paragraph 2 the author starts out saying how venus is earth's twin and that venus is the closest planet to us in terms of density and size. In the body paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus, NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems.

In this paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus,

NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. Some challenges the author says that venus is thowing at us is that venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that is covering the planet. In paragraph the the author also states that venus is on average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, that is hotter than mars and mars is the closest planet to the sun. The author also states that the atmosherpic pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. If the earth had that muh atmospheric pressure than there would be no one left on this planet because that is so much pressure that it can crush a submarine. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes to land on its surface. Next, i am going to talk about how NASA asspects on venus. Some thing that NASA is saying is that there only possible solution for how hot it is and how much pressure is in the air is that with these hostile conditions that venus shoudl allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the rolling Venusain landspace, with that venus would avoid the unfriendly group conditions by staying up and out of the way. The temperatures over the ground would still be 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. These conditons are not easy, but thye are surviable for human's. Finnally i am gonna talk about how we can solve the high pressure and high temperature. The first way we can solve these conditions are if we started having people go and live on venus and took some other living organisms with them. The second way we could solve it is if we found away to connect venus to earth and that would take away all ot the problems.

I would have to agree more with NASA's ideas on how to solve the problems venus is dealing with. i agree with the author it is just i don't think his idea's will wokr as well. One day i think we will be able to live on Venus and have it connected to Earth.

According to the article, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" Conditions like this include erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

Overall, human life is possible on Venus. Not easy, but possible. According to the article, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.""

E7C19DD59A48,"Do you ever wonder how many soomething is or how much something weights? In this essay the author compares more than one thing to one another.

The author supports the idea of ""The Challenging of Exploring Venus"" by comparing ""Earth as Venus twin and that it is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closet in distance too"" which means that Earth is the closet planet to Venus than any other planet in the world. Another way the author supports his text is by saying that ""Earth,Venus,and Mars,our other planety neighbor,orbit the sun at different speeds"" what that means is that all those other planets are the ones neighboring to it and that they have many different speeds and are many different sizes throughout the whole planet while it orbits. The third way the author supports his information in the text is by how he compares all the other planets to one another not just one planet to the next. Last supporting text the author supports in this is that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" what the author is trying to say is that one big thickness of the atmosphere is almost basically covered 97 percent with a carbon dioxide blanket. In conclusion the author compares all these planets to one another.

In the second paragrah the author loves to use many different techniques to describe the story to people who are reading it. Another thing the author does in the story is tell how much Earth,Venus,Mars weigh throughout the whole story. Another way the author supports his evidence in the story is by telling us were they are located at.

If anything ever happens to Earth the closest planets to explore and possibly populate are Mars and Venus. But there are some dangers to exploring these planets. For example on Venus a single rover has only lasted a couple of hours on the planet. So we dont know much about the planet. But that does not mean we cant explore and gain new information about the planet that mey help us out in the future. But the reason scientist and astronomers are looking more into the planet is because in paragraph 4. It states that Venus was probally a planet like Earth that had oceans and could have supported life. Another plus to explore Venus is the chance to figure out what happened to the planet. In the articel it says it used to be just like Earth in a way. So our natural assumption is to asume that our planet will end up just like Venus. But if we take some time and continue exploring the planet we might find some new information and could possiblly save all of humanity in the future.

However, we will find examples to support our claim by using deatils from the text. Lastly, we will discover more about Venus.

The author support the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger in exploring Venus by stating"" How astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, venus was probably covered largely coved with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

20F9EE3FEC1F,"Authors that present a well-developed, convincing argument can have a large influence on their reader's thoughts. In the passage, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author explains the different reasons as to why Earth, as a whole, should further study the planet of Venus, alotting all its difficulties. While the kinks of being able to go to Venus are still being worked out, this author gives insight as to why this barren planet is still important.

The first idea the author had was related to the atmosphere of Venus. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the coulds of higly corrosive sufuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" In Paragraph 3, the author does not give a higly convincing argument. Humans need oxygen to live, so how is it expected for them to survive on a planet that has little to no oxygen? It is not possible to change the chemical makeup of an entire planet. The argument displayed by the author is not credible in any way and does not give any reason as to why one would want to continure research in this area.

The next problem that Earth faces in studying Venus is that temperatures on this planet exceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature found nowhere on Earth. This temperature is beyond the maximun limit that human can edure, which leaves behind the compelling factor of wanting to study more of this sister planet. The author also states, "". . . and the atmospheric pressure is 9 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme that anything humans encounter on Earth."" If the conditions of Venus are so bad, why should we be expected to study more of this planet. Similar to the carbon dioxide in the air, there is no way to change the temperature and pressure of an entire planet. Once again, the argument given by this author is not convincing.

The author uses an idea proposed by NASA for humans to study Venus. They say that they could use hovering vehcles such as a blimp to fly over the planet, somewhere around 30 miles high. While 30 miles is a long way abover the planet, the temperature would still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, which is not ideal for reseachers. ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" If studying a planet is as difficult as the author is saying here, then Venus should be abandoned because even if NASA was able to study it, there is obviously no way that the planet will ever be suitable to live on. The author's arguments so far have all been a lost cause.

The author does explain that Venus may have been previously similar to Earth-like conditions, including oceans to support forms of life. He states that it has similar features to Earth such as valleys, mountains, and craters. While this may be too, Venus has come a long way in that it is no longer able to sustain life. Even if it previously was similar to Earth, that means that it has gotten worse over time, which says that from here on, it will continue to grow worse.

Proven by the author, Venus's conditions are far too extreme for the technology we have today. This planet is increasingly too dangerous to be explored, therefore the research toward it should be abandoned, and pushed more toward studying other plants, or even other solar systems in order to find another sutiable planet for humans to comfortably live on.

Although venus is very dangerous it would be a good way to find information. to help our planet and make our planet a better and safer place.

For example in the article they said that Venus has almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets. Also even more challenging is that ""on the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, And the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" We are still trying to figure out a way to go to venus though so we can figure out how venus can help benefit the earth. For example, in paragraph 4 They discuss why scientists are even interested in venus. They then tell us ""Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth."" ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,mountains, and craters."" NASA has been working on a compelling idea for sending humans to study and examine Venus. NASA is talking about building and designing a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. ""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms. Also this vehicle would allow them to hover over Venus's surface.

The author thinks this would be a great invention because It will help us better explore Venus. He also thinks that inventing this would help are planet, Because by inventing this it would help us better explore Venus to help are earth. It would be great for a lot of reasons,But I think it would help us get better Ideas for further inventions. It would also help us find out interesting things about Venus that we've never learned about. This is why I think visiting mars is a must in our World and society today.

The author also tells us that this is very risky and dangerous,and if you don't use the right precaution it can end up very bad. I think too that he wants it to be safe for the people that are going to Venus. The author thinks that this is so dangerous he doesn't even want do it. He then says it is very important to find out what is going on with our planet though. He thinks this can really help beneifit are planet.

I think the overall point the author is trying to get across is that it is risky but needs to be done. The author points out so many reasons good and so many bad. But in the end he talks about why it would beneifit us for the better.          ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
B5D9F34D2CAC,"Have you ever wondered what it is like in Venus and how we might be able to study more about it. Studying Venus closely is worth the risk for more information on Venus. With the information it could lead scientists into making better technology to explore mars or other planets. The exploration could also be our backup Earth if the current Earth in inhabitable. With all the risk it may not be possible to explore Venus but if you are determined to find the answers then it could be possible.

There would be all sorts of information if we studied Venus closely. There are a lot of problems but it is still possible. There are a lot of people that wants to know more about Venus. For example on paragraph 4 it states that, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This is stating that Astronomers know that one day Venus will change and humans will be soon able to land on it without much difficulties.

The information just from Venus could even help us explore other planets and solar systems far from our solar system. With the information we could possibly find another earth-like planet faster or easier. On paragraph 8 it states, ""...but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This quote is stating that our curiousty will soon take us over and eventually humans will do anything to findout more about Venus or anything in general. I believe that someday we will be able to find the truth about Venus and more information or data that can help us with exploring other planets.

All of us have thought of what will happen if the current Earth we live on is destroy or inhabitable. Well our 2 options are either Mars or Venus, if we knew more of the planet Venus and how it behaves. On paragraph 4 it says that, "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This is stating that Venus could return or we can make it return to how it was originally and possibly live on it. This is a good reason I think Venus will be able to accept humans and find more facts and informations.

In conclusion we have wondered how things are in Venus. We even wanted to know what would happen to humans if they went to Venus. There would be lots of information if we visited and came back perfectly. With all those information we got from visiting Venus it could help us with other difficulties from different planets.

Venus is very dangerous and questionable place that in my opinion the amout of heat could be very harmful to our skin the author thinks that its a good idea to live on venus well i beg to differ because people on earth already get sunburnt just from a little bit of sun at the beach. Or at a swimming pool .Just think of how many hospital visits venus would have .Hang on there isnt anything on venus but heat and radiation and dry air there isnt any hospitals .Well thats another concern there as well as the heat and radiation that are bad for humans .

The author suggests that humans should go to Venus because there might have been life on venus because its earths twin. Also he says ""If we could get more research about venus than we might have a strong possibility"". Also now days everone has a cell phone or some type of device thats electronic well it says in the pasage that ""Just imagine exposing a cell such as a phone or a tablet to acid or heat on venus capable of melting tin"". That there alone is a problem because kids teens adults act like they cant live without any celluar devices whenever a techer takes it from a student at school they argue throw temer tantrums yell scream etc. Just imagine going to venus and hearing all the complaining fromthose teens and kids and infants crying because they cant have there leap frog game or there tablet full of cool games and stuff on it .

All i'm trying to say is venus is not a good place because people get tired of summer and want to have winter or fall just something a lot cooler than the hottness all the time .There goes another complaint the phones and the heat wow I would get irratated after a while of complaining .

In conclusion, venus is going to be fun and exiting to most people until they are there all the time and think about all the heat resisting clothes and shoes headbands etc. We'll haft to wear 24/7 speaking of 24/7 is the time still the same will it be difficult for people on earth to find out and live on venus with the time change . All i'm trying to say is that there are some people who are going to agree then when they get there and feel the hotness and the radiation and see there phones, tablets, leap frogs , etc. all melt away in the heat and radiation 9 times out of 10 there going to want to go back to earth .

A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. Still, being so far above the surface the conditions are still not easy but they're survivable for humans.

Since we would have to hover over the surface, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else from a distance. But to understand Venus we would have to be up close and personal despite the risks.

Venus is to me is yes it is worth pursuiting despite all of its dangers to the human life form. I belive this cause how are we ever going to know the truth if we don't go and find it out for ourselfs. We have to go out there an look for ourself so that we know what is out there. What really extist was there once life form on Venus. If so whendid they die or are they still there. See we will never uncover the truth if we dont break out of our shell and go exporing to the unknown we have to do it. Nobody esle is going to go out into space and find out what is really up in space.

We have our theory about other life out in space, of the once vallys, mountains and the carter on the surface of Venus so that we have our theory that once a long long time ago there once were a form of life on Venus. Now we have to think about how they lived, how they got their food, how they did all the thing sthat we as humans do but on a planet that has low gravit pulling you down. On Earth we have a greater about of gravit pull us down to the ground than Venus does. Earth has also more water than Venus does now, but what if that was to change . What if the planet Venus had more water than Earth. What if Venus and better things than Earth does. Then why did Venus died what had to happen to whipe out and whgole plant that had maybe life form of some sort and that we know had water and enough oxygen to have the livingh life form of some kind to kive there. So what did happen to the planet Venus. How did this onbce living planet now become with no life form of any kinds.

The only danger of this idea of going to the planet Venus is that what if they don't make it home. Whatif ther are other life form living on Venus still but we just dont know what they are or how they came about there are hunders of thing that we as human we have not yet discover. An maybe will never discover about how we got to where we are today. How we have got what we have today. These are thing that we may never truthy understand about where we came from.

98B33A9F1D9C,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author leaves the reader to infer that exploring Venus' surface is a good idea. I believe that the author did very well supporting his claim. In Paragraph 4, the author states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" If this is true, then could Venus become like Earth once again? I believe the author is trying to say that Venus is worth exploring to see if it is able to be like Earth once more. In Paragraph 6, the author suggests, ""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough misson to understand Venus would need to get up close and person despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges."" I believe the author is correct in this statement. If we start looking at exploring Venus as a challenge instead of a risk, it could possibly give researchers more motivation to get out and explore. In Paragraph 8, the author claims, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author brought up the word ""challenge"" again, and I believe that he really thinks the challenge is worth it. I agree with him in this claim because if humans can explore Venus, I also believe we can go on to do bigger and better things with exploring our solar system. The author did a good job in making his claims and then proceeding to back them up with evidence and facts. Although he had some opinions, the article was overall well written and well put together.

4A45C0B6B484,"Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. As explained in paragraph two, there have been many spacecrafts sent to it´s mysterious surface, but not many make it for more than a few hours. It´s also been noted that its atmosphere is too extreme for human encounterment. The author uses these, what may seem like disadvantages to futher exploration, to his advantage. He uses backed up statements like older technology could help and that the dangers are just mere challenges.

The author brought up a good argument that todays advanced technology might a little too advanced to get the job done. As stated in paragraph seven, modern computers have helped a lot with research progress, but that was in enviornments that were better understood. Venus is entirely different, atmosphere, temperature, and pressure wise. It´s going to take something new, or something old, such as the mechanical computers, with some adjustments.

The author also mentioned one thing most people can´t resist - a challenge. Though there are multiple risks to furthur more thourough exploration of this planet, it really is just one huge challenge. Venus alone is challenging some of the most advanced technology on this planet. A challenge that NASA should be willing to overcome.

Venus is a very worthy pursit despite the dangers it comes with. The author does a very well job explaining his aproach on furthur exploration of the complicated planet. He in turn has more than enough details to support it. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
FD4C11CFDC5A,"I'm going to talk about the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". By this unknown author who wrote this. My name is PROPER_NAME and this will be an essay so bare with me. It will be long and show how the author supports the idea. Without a further due, lets jump right into this essay.

The author talks how the idea of people can adpat to the conditions of Venus and settle there like our home planet Earth. There are some problems that he think are challenges. The planet is 90 times the amount of pressure we have on Earth. Most of the air is carbon dioxide blankets that covers 97 percent of the planet's thick atmosphere. The temperature is around about to 800 degrees on the planet.

Venus that has the hottest surface temperature that would melt anything on contact including people. Also, it would crush you or anything else like a piece of paper. There is also bad weathering that cause problems. Like for example: erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

On the postive side, we can make a vehicle that will let us float above the fray. Use solar energy to power the vehicle to float. We can avoid the unfriendly conditions on the ground. The degress will be around toasty at around 170 degrees. The pressure will be around sea level on Earth. The radiation would not exceed Earth levels.

This why I think the authors idea is good. It can help us show how humans are progressing through the years of tech advancements. This world will become someday extinct and we will somehow surivive. NASA will always find a way to expand. Thank you for reading this essay and I hope you enjoy.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
D377F569FE8D,"Scientists shouldn't travel to Venus anytime soon. Why would you say that you may ask there are a few reasons why scientist shouldn't travel to Venus. Venus isn't a safe place to travel to. It's already a risk traveling in space, but it's an even bigger risk to travel to Venus. Here are some of the reasons why Venus isn't safe.

First the unimaginable heat on Venus can make metal boil in a snap. According to the text "" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"". The average summertime day on Earth ranges from 90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit those are temperatures some people can barely stand. Imagine 8 times 100 degrees that sure is toasty. No human can last 1 second on Venus without protection, and without being burnt to a crisp.

Next the atmosphere is mostly made of carbon. According to the text ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"". These are poor conditions to live under especially since humans can't live without oxygen. The carbon is also poisonous to humans as well in order to breath on this planet you'd need a huge oxygen tank. Not to mention there's also sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

Finally just like Earth Venus has natural disasters as well. The text states "" Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"". Unlike Earth these conditions are amplified on Venus, and are stronger on Venus than on Earth. any evidence scientists do get from probes is electrical shock. Imagine what would happen to any ship we send with human in it ""KAPOW"" lightning strikes.

It's safe to say Venus isn't human friendly. Venus isn't human friendly because of the; boiling heat, the carbon dioxide, and the intense natural disasters.

Venus doesn't seem robot friendly either due to when a probe gets close it'll stike the probe with lightning. As if these are warning signs Venus clearly doesn't want any visitors anytime soon it's best to stay on Earth for now. Venus is uninhabitable for now at least you'll never know what the future may bring. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
F22E565BDE38,"The author excellently supports the idea that even though it is dangerous, Venus is worth exploring. You can tell the author supports the idea of further exploration of Venus because of their use of details. The author explains Venus, why it is so dangerous, and why we should continue exploring it to support the idea that Venus is a challenge that we should not give up on.

One of the reasons the authors point comes across so well is how in depth they explain Venus so that the reader can be more knowlegable about the topic before the author begins to explain why we should continue to explore it. The author gives as much detail as a book about planets so that the reader knows that the author is well versed in the topic and is not having an opinion without factual evidence to support it. In paragraph 2, it says ""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin"", Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds."". Throughout this paragraph, the author gives information about Venus so you can understand in depth how and why it is explored, and most importantly, why it is so dangerous.

The danger of Venus is why it is mostly unknown, and why humans want to study it more. Even unmanned missions do not survive Venus's burning temperatures and intense pressure for more than a couple hours, making it very challenging to study. The author uses data like in the quote "" A thick atmosphere of amost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.""(paragraph 3), to show how dangerous it is and why Venus is mostly unexplored. The author shows that the danger is not keeping NASA away, but it is drawing them closer. The author states that ""Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" (paragraph 4). To the author, natural human curiousity is another reason why we should continue pursuing Venus, and how we are going to continue to explore Venus, even if it is dangerous.

The author uses examples of ideas from real scientists to support the statement that we should not give up on the idea of knowing more about Venus. NASA is still trying to figure out a way to have people explore Venus deeper. The author uses NASA's solutions to the conditions of Venus to explain why we should never stop exploring space. NASA is coming up with solutions to Venus, but they might prove ineffective, so pursuing Veus is still a worthy idea. They are trying to come up with a way to float above the harms of Venus, so they can still study it close, but be unaffected by the harmful temperatures and pressures of the surface. The author offers a rebuttal to this idea, saying ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" (paragraph 6). This information the author presents makes the reader understand that Venus is insanely difficult to explore when even NASA can not present useful ideas for intense exploration. But even when every idea is shut down, the author makes it clear that we should not give up the fight for exploration.

Venus is still an unhabitable planet for even our smartest robots. We as humans have tried our hardest to make sure we understand the many planets in out solar system. Even though it seems impossible, the author explains very successfully that this does not mean exploring Venus is impossible, it just means Venus is a complicated puzzle, but when it is solved, everyone will be overwhelmed with satisfaction, so to the author, giving up is not an option. The author believes that one day, exploring Venus in depth will be possible, and they explain their reasoning behind it very clearly so the reader can understand that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents.

887770A6B2E1,"In this story, the author talks about how humans are capable of landing on Venus and checking the planet out. He states that there are many dangers like the high atmospheric pressure Venus has, and that Venus has the hottest temperature surface in all of the planets. Each mission they had was unmanned, and no space craft survived a landing for more than a few hours. The author supports his claim of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers bad because he explains that there are more dangers than possibilities and they have just conducted research and never tried or invented anything he states yet.

NASA says they could create a blimp- like vehicle that hovers about 30 or so miles above Venusian landscape. This would work out because they have liveable conditions from where they are floating at, but they couldn't do anything with the info they get. When they are 30 miles above the ground it makes it difficult because most forms of light can only cover the dense atmosphere. The text states, ""Most importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" This is saying that scientists wouldn't be able to take substances form Venus back home to the US and the scientists would mainly have to explain all there observations from sight. The author also talks about how scientists are working on innovations and certain inventions that have not happend yet so he can't explain more details on how they could make it to Venus but many things have to be innovated first.

NASA is also working on other approaches to get to Venus, but we can't start sending people to Venus if we don't even know if the invention or approach could work. There are more dangers than ways to get to Venus safely in this article so that is also a reason why I think he does a bad job supporting his claim. Venus to me is not really worth researching for just because of those conditions that the planet has, but if the blimp-like thing works out, I still think the scientists wouldn't be able to see what they wanted and get no good evidence. Like I said, pictures and any light source would be hard to get when you're in Venus. NASA and other researchers should focus on a different planet than Venus because It would be way to difficult to get people there, yet alone get reseach from Venus.

""The Evening Star,"" although being the brightestplanet and ""twin""of earth , proves to be a very challenging place to exiamine. ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is an article written by the author explaining the reasons of why exploration to Venus is very dangerous and why it wants to be explored by scientists.

It also gives brief information about how Venus is made up and the history of why is an intruiging planet. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" The author supports his idea by using data based information, question and answer responses, and the history of exploration in Venus.

In the article, the author uses a lot of data based information to support his claims about the challenges of exploration in Venus. One of the most mportant pieces of information being about what type of planet Venus is and why it is dangerous. The author says ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience o our own planet""(Paragraph 3). This briefly gives detail of how dangerous it is for humans to visit Venus knowing that the atmospheric pressure could easily crush a submarine that can withstand high pressures and liquefy many metals. This also supports his/her claims of why it is likely that the idea of exploring venus is impossible for these very reasons. Not only does this help support his claim; the information informs the reader about Venus and lets them know more about why it is a plant that NASA is very intrigued in.

In the article, the author uses a good amount of question and answer responses that help to inform the reader and support his claims of why exploration to Venus is dangerous. A good exapmle of a question that most readers will thnk of would be ""Why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?""(Paragraph 4). This question not only supports his claim but also gains the readers trust knowing that the author is very informed about what he/she is talking about and knows what the readers want to know about. Knowing that the author can recall much information about the dangers and expectations of further exploration to venus benefits his argument by gaining their trust and support on his claim.

Using the history of exploration in Venus helps support the authors claims in many ways. Knowing the history falls back into the subect that the author know whae/she is talking about and also allows the reader to know more about the subject. ""Vensu was probably covered largely with oceans and could have suppported various forms of life, just like those on earth,""(Paragraph 4). This piece of information breifly explains the reasons of why scientists value the research done with Venus knowing that it is very comparable to earth. This information also explains the now leading dangers of Venus because of its physical changes and leads to the possiblilities given by NASA of ways that Venus can be explored.

The author supports his idea of Venus's exploration being impossible by using data based information, question and answer responses, and the history of exploration in Venus. Giving the data of how Venus's state is and the leading dangers that the planet could give if explored supports the authors claims and allows the reader to now then make the decision or to be informed if Venus should be explored or not.

Venus is called the evening star is one the brightest ponits of light in the night sky making it simple for even an amater stragazer to spot. The reason we explore or visit other plants its because the human curioity will likely lead us to many other discovers.

Second Venus is called the earth twins. why do you ask? Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closet in distance too.

Venus is the 2nd planet from the sun its still pretty simple to see from a safe distance on earth but it has proved to be a very challenging place to examine closely because of how extremely hot the planet is since its the 2nd planet from the sun.

Venus is also sometimes referred to as earths twin since its the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size and at times its closer to earth then the moon and to mars too and thats because of the difference in how fast the planets are orbiting the sun.

If researchers are not able to aquire the information they need to research Venus thoroughly and without putting themselves in harms way, it shows that it is not a worthy pursuit. The author does not support his idea while explaining this.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author does not show enough support as to why pursuing Venus is worth studying despite the dangers. Instead, under multiple instances, the author gives all the more reason we should explore from afar. The author's idea does not get across, from describing the limitations of spacecrafts and humans to the treacherous atmosphere and climate of Venus.   ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
CAD242499411,"In the article ""The challenge of exploring venus"" The author does a great job of supporting the idea. I think anyone who is adventuruse and likes to learn about space would agree with the author. Such as my self, I like learning about our facinating solar system as well. How ever there are some pros and cons of exploring venus. Theres alot of factoring that goes into something like exploring another planet. You need to plan for everything and make sure yor ready.

In the artile the author does a fantastic job of convincing the reader to believe that exploring venus is a good idea. He also states that ""not a single spaceship has touched down on venus, This makes the reader want the integrity to do it even more. He also states the harsh conditions of venus and how no human could survive on venus. But yet comes up with a solution of how we can still go to venus wthout dieing. He purposes that you could use a ""blimp like"" plane to fly 30-40 miles above vensus and the tempuratres are bareable. However he doesnt propose whos funding it, how much it cost, or when this will take place. These things could lead the readr in a different direction when reading this.

By now im pretty sure you have a good understanding of what the author was trying to get across. You may ask why would people still want to explore in such harsh conditions, but the author does a great got of stating reasons why people such as astronoust still explore these harsh places. This gives good opportunity to discover something new and be credited for it. You never k ow you could be the next. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
1561823BC14C,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and how he was saying different things about how Venus is and was shows that he really does have an interest in studying Venus and he defends his argument well because he goes into detail on what he wants to do and what he wants to know.

Although the passage is having to do with exploring Venus theres nothing much said about them doing things because they failed multiple times and by the looks of it I don't think its going to happen because of how the author talks about Venus.

The author seems to be doing everything he could to actually try to explore Venus despite the difficulties they are having, that even if it is dangerous the author will still try to do something about it.

In my opinion I think what the author's doing is very dangerous because he doesn't know what the outcome is going to be, it could go both good and bad because there is a possibility that anything can happen, as said in the article though, they are only looking at sending technology to try to explore Venus not humans so it wouldn't be as dangerous and I think thats why the author is still open on exploring it and not giving up so he can try to find some answers to what hes been questioning.

In the last paragraph (8) the author states that the challenge presented by Venus has value because of human curiosity because it will lead them into many equally intimidating endeavors and just basically saying to think of it as an imagination but at the same time something you can do and want to achieve.

In conclusion if the author thinks that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit then that's what hes going to go for, some people are also curious on that and so the author trying to do that will be helpful to others and himself and if he does succeed others will be satisfied with what the author came up with besides the dangers the study presents I do think that it will all be worth it at the end of the day, because that's a goal they've been trying to accomplish for sometime now.

The author included lots of information of the planet Venus, and also some fun facts in which I also included in my passage. Venus is referred to as the Earth's twin. Venus is closest to Earth in density, the size, and sometimes in distance. In spance terms human have sent lots of spacecrafts to land on the cloud draped world. No spacecraft has survived the landing for more then a few hours on Venus. This is why a single space ship hasn't been on Venus in more than three decades.

With such a thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets around Venus. The author has been stating lots of backgound information about Venus which helps on knowing when we need to have to be able to stand the conditions. Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times what we experience on our planet each day. Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our very soloar system, even if Mercury is closer to the sun. Venus is the most earth like planet in our solar system.

Venus still has some features that are close to the same on Earth. The planet has a hard rocky surface that includes valleys, mountains, and craters. The author is talking about new ways to apportch the planet without having to land on it because of its toasty temperatures. There still isn't a way to get samples of its land, but with all the information they have gathered where they can have our machines last long enough that they can stand the harsh climates of Venus. However, all they need right now is to get up close. The author doesn't think because there's a obstical in the way of a new discovery you shouldn't give up.

And according to the article, Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any planet in our solar system. A thick atmoshphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Venus also has similar features to Earth. Such as Mountains, valleys, craters and others.

According to the author, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the troubles it may presents. In the article from paragraph five, The National Aeronautics and Space administration known as ""NASA"" has an interesting idea of sending humans to study more about Venus. They allow scientist to float above the fray while seeing the rolling Venusian landscape. Just as how jet airplanes fly at the higher attitude, passing the storms and also that way, they could stay safe far away from Venu's surface area. Since it is dangerous to be on Venus surface area, researchers could not take any samples of rock, or gas, or anything that's on the planet.

In conclusion, it is a worthy exploration and it is somewhat important to learn more about Venus. So that way, we could also discover things that we haven't yet discover and study from it. As it said on the article, in the very last paragraph, Venus is challenging to all of us. Because not only the facts that it attracts scientist and researchers out there, it also lead human curiosity to explore more about it.       ",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
975C17CEBFEB,"In the story Venus is sometimes called the ''Evening Star'' is one of the brightest points in the night sky,making it simple for even an amateur stargaze to spot. The nickname was misleading because Venus is actually a planet. Often referred to as Earth's ''twin'' Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in distance too. Venus is sometimes around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason,since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. On the planet's surface,temperature average over 800 degress Fahrenheit,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our own plant. Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Long ago Venus was maybe or probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere,rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to their knowledge of Venus. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Studying to meet the challange presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

4397809A2D94,"As humans, everyone is curious and want to learn new things about our world. NASA is a govermnet organization that strives to find new things every day that will improve our understanding of our galaxy. One of the planets that scientists have looked at lately is Venus. Venus is planet that scientists have trying to find out more about although the planet is very hostile and dangerous. If scientists can figure out more about Venus, we can further our understanding of what this planet is and what it once was. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" writes his feelings about how dangerous it is as well as how desiring it is to further explore more information about this planet.

There are many different things that scientists are intrested about when it comes to this planet. Many studies have shown that Venus might have been at one point the most like earth planet in the solar system. The author states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have been supported various forms of life, jut like Earth""(4). The passage further sugests that although it would crutial to find out about this planet there are draw backs. There have been many missions for spacecrafts to land on this planet but none of them ""survived the landing for more than a few hours""(2). Although the planet is so close to us, the conditions are very dangerous for exploration. The author informs the reader of the harsh conditions of the planet, but also show the reader insight to possible reasons why it is so worthy of studying.

Venus is a very interesting planet and has conditions tht sugest that it was just like earth. There even is proof that suggests that there once was some living organisms on this planet as well. The author informs us by writing, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life""(4). Scientist using this knowledge that there were once life forms, can think of solutions for people to go to Venus. This can help explorers and scientist to learn more about how life lived on this planet and what it was like. The drawback to this idea is that Venus is a planet filled with gas and is roughly, ""170 degrees Fahrenheit""(5). This temperature is very harsh conditions for humans to live in or even exploring what is on this planet.

Although the planet is filled with gas and is not suitable for exploring with robots or people. The author suggest there are many positive things on exploring Venus, like studying life forms and what the planet consists of despit e the challenges that are in the way.

There are so many cool things that we can learn about Venus and scientists have no idea what these things might be. Human nature is to descover new things about our world. That is how humans learned new things over time and progressed through civilization. Venus is a very intresting planet that NASA is stil kind of confused about the planet and want to know more about it. If there were solar pannels on Venus then the ""solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Never the less, Venus is a planet that is very dangerous and there needs to be many precautions before thinking about putting people on it. Not only is the temperature of the the planet warmer, it is also, ""90 times greater atmoshperic pressure than earth""(3). The air pressure on this planet is so much stronger, that it is going to be harder for astronauts to be on this planet for a certain amount of time. The author brings up many ideas regarding how dangerous Venus is, but at the same time humans want to satisfy our curiosity by learning more about what this planet consists of.

In conclusion, the author supports that Venus is a worthy pursuit depsite the dangers. The writer did a very good job by using facts to support his claim regarding the exploration of this planet. Curiosity is what mainly drives exploration in humans. Scientists and explorers can not hold back from these drawbacks because in the end, we want to know more about the unknown qualities of this planet and what they consist of despite what challenges we might have to face.

Scientists will find a way to learn more about this planet although there are many challenges that lie in their path. Just like these scientists, everyone should not give up because of roadblocks that come their way rather, they should keep trying and think about it differently.

7B33F5CB5EE1,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author provided reasons on why exploring Venus is so important.

The author beleives that Venus should be explored because it is ""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"". (Paragraph 2). Another reason why the author believes that Venus should be explored is because ""It may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.""( Paragraph 4). These two reasons explain why it can be beneficial to explore Venus. To prove that Venus was and is so similar to Earth the author provided details such as, ""Venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,"" and ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" (Paragraph 4). Providing these details helped support the idea that Venus is so similar to Earth. Proving that Venus is so similar to Earth can show people that it might be worthy to explore it. The author also talked about ways that could possibly make exploring Venus safer. In paragraph 5 the author says, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" giving this information can show that there are safe options that are in the works for exploring Venus.

The author's use of supporting details was well used in supporting his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. The author also stated possible disadvantages and dangers that could happen which helped improve his claim. If the author only used the positive affects and left the dangers out I think it would have hurt his article. Overall, I think this article was written well with plenty of supporting details.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
C22F146C37E1,"Venus is the second planet in our solar system, and despite how close it is to Earth, is largely unexplored. The reason why its been untouched for around 30 years is that Venus is too hot and has too much atmospheric pressure, which would crush and melt any spacecraft on its surface. Another reason is that there are clouds of corrosive sulfuric acid. However, NASA is working on ways to study Venus more safely.

In the passage, the author talks about why astronomers are facinated with Venus. They talk about how how the astronomers think that Venus used to be more Earth-like than it is today, with its valleys, mountains, and craters, in paragraph 4. Though in pragraph 3, the challenges presented by trying to study Venus more closley have more negatives than positives. One of the biggest problems in that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of the planets in the solar system, despite that Mercury is closer to the sun than Venus. Another problem being faced is the immense atmospheric pressure, which is around 90 times greater than Earth's.

The author also talks about how NASA is trying to find ways to counteract these problems. One example that they give, in paragraph 7, is that simple electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber that closley emulates the surface conditions of Venus. NASA has found that the technology lasted three weeks under those conditions. Another way that NASA is trying to solve the problems of Venu's surface is by using old, mechanical computers, which don't use the same kind of technology as regular, modern computers, but gears and levers instead.

In conclusion, putting a spacecraft on the surface of Venus may be a possibility in the future, or we may never find a way to keep a spacecraft on the surface for more than a few weeks at a time, which is cost ineffective. But as the author says in paragraph 8, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

He talks about one of NASA's many possible solutions, saying ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."". What he is talking about is a vehicle that would hover above Venus so it would never touch the surface. It's genius! The reason why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is because ""it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."". Even today it has features similiar to that of Earth, like its rocky surface, mountains, and craters. Another possible solution to researching Venus while trying to avoid its harsh terrain is using old technology, used in World War II, and putting this old technology into a new use. The author says the reason these might help the future of exploring Venus because ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" these might be more resistant to whats in store for them on Venus.

While the challenges of visiting Venus are certainly disheartening, the value of visiting and exploring Earth's ""twin"", and one of its closest planets is impossible to know, but the pursuit of knowledge of the planet would make it a worthwhile endeavor.

As more technology advances, NASA has a compelling idea to possibly land on venus safely. In paragraph five, it is stated: ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile onditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.""

He also makes the point that Venus may have held life at some point. He states that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"".

His next topic was about how we have already sent space crafts over to Venus. All of them, however, were unmanned.

Even without anyone in the ships, the spaceships were still crushed by the pressure of the planet. He states that ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"". He then goes on to say that this is probably why no spaceships have touched the planet fr three decades.

He goes on to talk about how NASA has been trying to come up with ideas on how to inhabit the planet with life. they came up with a few good ideas but the one that stood out to him the most was a bit interesting. He says that NASA wanted to try and get a blimp like spaceshi to float 30 miles above Venus' surface. at ths spot it isnt too hot or too dangerous and is almost perfect for life. the heat, however, would still be a whopping 170 degrees fahrenheit and we would be stuck in a thick cloud in CO2.

In that sentence alone there is still some uneasiness since it's not sure or confirmed that Venus was once like Earth.

Therefore, this is why the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" doesn't support the idea of studying Venus very clearly. The lack of pros and benifits to our planet adding to the pot of cons and uncertainty that was instead made from reading this article. Surely they did a splendid job in guiding us through possible ways that'll help in exploring the harsh environments and listing final encounters we have had before, but no information was straightforward when it came as to why we should invest time in going to Venus when such dangerous challenges are in front of us.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
24320C969520,"The article 'The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is very convincing. The author had many great points and was also compairing Venus to Earth. Definitly will grab your attention. A really great con of exploring Venus is that it has many common things to Earth. In paragraph 2 it states that Venus is often referred to Earth as a twin. Also it states that Venus is the second planet in our solar system. Another con why Venus is a great topic to explore is that if there was ever a time in a life time that we had to live in another world, Venus is the answer to that problem. In paragraph 5 it states that

NASA has particulary compelling ideas for sending humans to study Venus, but it the temperatures would be toasty at sorund 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Not easy conditiond, but survivable for humans.

Over alll I think we should continue reaseaching about Venus and exploring Venus, not only because it would help us humans learn more about our solar system, but it could be a new home for our community.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
8555ED31A266,"Our solar system revolves around many different planets, one being Venus. There are many people who study each and every one of the planets in our atmosphere, from the distance it is from us, to the gravitational pull, to its velocity, etc. To have a better understanding of each planet, technology has helped immensly as well as going into space and seeing everything for ourselves in person.

Being an explorer in space comes with both good and bad things. For example, as stated in the passage, ""no spacecraft has yet to survive the landing or visit to Venus."" Many people may not find this as a huge issue due to the fact we humans aren't necessarily built as spacecrafts, and of course I agree, but in my opinion that is still a risk. Another con is that Venus is the hottest planet, although Mercury is closer to the sun as the author mentioned in Paragraph 3, Venus can be deadly due to the pressure and heat it holds.

As everything else in life, there can be a good outcome. I believe learning about what is surrounding us outside of Earth is very important. Not only will we be infromed, but there has been said that there was life in Venus almost as much as we have on Earth, they don't call Venus ""Earth's twin"" for simply no reason. I strongly believe that we're closer to a better future each and everyday that goes by, scientists, geologists, etc all try to capture some sort of new information that can possibly help our future in a good and positive matter.

In conclusion, all the information the author of this passage provided me with gave me a better understanding on whether or not it's worth it to continue trying to discover more about this similar planet to Earth. From what I read, I can intake that yes it can be dangerous as I stated in the second paragraph, it can risk lives, but at the same time life is full of risks. It's important to me as well as I'm sure it is to others, to know if there can be another life somewhere completely different and that not being a state or country by any means, it's literally a different planet. Therefore, traveling outside of Earth is a huge challenge, but fear shouldn't stop us from gaining such innovation for our future. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

Venus may never be habitable by humans because of the harsh conditions the surface goes through with a sitting temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit and a atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than the Earths.

""Evening Star""

was given since Venus is actualy a planet.

Venus is the closest planet to the Earth in terms of density and size, and sometimes is the closest in distance too. The differences in speed beetwen Earth, Venus and Mars is that sometimes we are closest to the Mars and sometimes we are closest to Venus. The explication of why not a single spaceshio has touches down on Venus in moran than three decades is that each previous mission was unmanned, since no spacecraft survived the landing for mora than a few hours

The atmosphore of Venus is almost 97 percent carbojn dioxide, but one thing that is dangerous in Venus are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphore. The atmospheric presure in Venus is 90 times grather than in our planet, that means that in the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, that is a extreme danger for us. Also notable, even Mercury is closer to our sun, Venus is the planet with the hottest surface temperature in our solar system; also al of this (the weather condition and the preasure) Venusian geology present other problems, for example there are many active volcans, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.

The reason why scientists are even discussing the posibility to futures visits to Venus is because it is the planet most liked to the Earth in our solar system. One time maybe Venus was covered by oceans and life, just like the Earth.

NASA maybe have one solution to human can go to explore Venus. Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Just as our jet airplanes travel to a higher altitude to fly over many storms. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the preasure would be closest to the Earth's presure, there are still not easy condition but there can be survival for humans.

However, researchers cannot take samples of rok, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our5 machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.

NASA is working in other ideas to solve this problem in Venus, for example, they are making a electronic device made by silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface.

Strivging to meet the challenge present by Venus, our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innvation.    ",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2

Our sister planet could have been covered in many oceans and held many kinds of life. just those little two facts bring the scientists in and make them wanna learn more about it. venus has rocky sediment, mountains and craters which earth all has. in order to explore venus they would have to be very careful because how deadly and dangerous it could be they bring up a spacecraft very relative to a blimp that they would be able to use and study and explore venus from a very safe area without causing any harm to the scientists on board they would be about 30 or so miles above the surface area it would still be very hot around 170 degrees farenheight but do able because the blimps outer layer would keep the scientists from burning up or getting too hot . they are coming up with other ideas other than the blimp like spacecraft they havee also come up with the idea to send a roverthat is made out of silicon carbide that has lasted 3 weeks in venus like conditions. the scientists only want to learn more about venus mostly for its path and what it could have looked like and to make a breakthrough with some big news that venus was almost identical to the place we live on called earth. as the author says in his last paragraph ""striving to explore venus has value not only because of the insight that will be gained but out of your normal human curiosity"" for the last point he says "" our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" which in total supports his whole statement of is venus a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

These dangers include the enviroment, but it is worthy pursuit becuase it part of human curiosity, and innovation.

The atmosphere of Venus is very harmful since it is coated by a thick blankets of carbon dioxide, almost 97 percent of the atmosphere is coated.""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere""(paragraph 3).

The temperature are also extreme on Venus. The average temperatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 time greater that what we experience on earth.

""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans."" (paragraph 4). Scientists also believe that Venus can be be our nearest option for a planetary visit. NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. Many forms of light cannot penatrate the dense atmosphere so we cannot takepictures, nor can they take rock,gas, or anything else.

Landing and exploring Venus can lead to innovation for humans. NASA is looking for more solution to be able to study Venus. They are testing out old technology so they can combine it with new technology like the computer. These experiences can innovate many other technology so that we can explore venus.

CA0FD1882980,"The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is simply about Venus and why we should explore it, even though it has many dangers. The author definetley has good evidence to support his or her claim, but I do believe that he or she strays from the main idea of the question throughout the article.

The author does not support this idea enough. As I read throughout the story, I only noticed about one paragragh that was actually explainging why we should explore Venus. According to the prompt, the author is being evaluated on how well he or she supports that claim. I did not see enough support through the whole story. When the author did support the idea though he or she had very good evidence. According to the the article the reason we should explore Venus is because it is the closest planet like ours. I think that the author should go more in depth and explain how and why that is, so that he or she can really pull us in.

Next is that even though the author didn't show a lot of support in why we should explore Venus, he or she did have good evidence on how we would. Most of the story was the author explaining different ways of how we could possibly explore Venus safely. For example, the author explained how NASA has been working on other approaches to study Venus. Like, special electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in Venus like conditions and the electronic lasted for three weeks. If the author has good support like this, he or she should most importantly discuss more of why Venus should be explored to spike our interest more in knowing how to do so.

To conclude, the author doesn't support the claim of studying Venus enough. He or she should include more details as of why we would want to study Venus.

Venus has a lot of similarities with Earth, but hasn't been reserached enough throughout the years which needs to change in order for the future to be able to pursue their goals. The author makes a clear point in the article and supports their text with evidence to prove why society has the chance to research further into Venus and find out so much more about our neighboring planet. Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because of the similarities we share among them, the close distance between us, and the history that Venus has had which could've possibly ""supported various forms of life.""

First, Venus and Earth share a lot of similarities within themselves. ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Also, many years ago, there are speculations that Venus was probably full of oceans and could suport many different types of life, just as Earth was too. Many people may argue that since it was awhile ago, it can be completely different now which is true, but the author explains themself perfectly because they add that it still shares many features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Lastly, although the temperatures differ between the two planets, the author provides a great alternative to hover 30 miles above the surface of Venus. This way, people are still in contact with Venus, but remain safe with the conditions that they have put themselves in.

Furthermore, the close distance between Earth and Venus make it a lot easier for travel and research. Although that they are still far distances away, it is very close when comparing planets, and the convienence of being close provides the chance of quality research, and possibly visiting in the near future. ""Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner--in space terms--humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world."" None of the spacecrafts survived more than a few hours, but that quote should motivate and challenge the workers and future workers of NASA to hopefully get the working pieces together to form a spacecraft that can survive long amounts of time.

Lastly, since Venus once could've supported various forms of life, the possibility to be able to support life again is quite high. With the right tools and research, we as a society can make an effort and use our curiosity as motivation to fight to be able to obtain life on Venus. With the surplus amounts of valleys, mountains, and craters that it has today, humans should not fear Venus for the fact that we have these features on Earth as well. The author once again provides a great statement because providing knowledge that both planets have similarties is crucial, and may even be a reason to explore and research further into Venus.

In conclusion, the author supports the idea of studying Venus as a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents well because of how close the two planets are, the many similarities that both planets share, and also the history of Venus once supporting life.

There are about 3 paragraphs that are full of bad things that could happen to a person on Venus. The other paragraphs do not fully explain why it would be worthy of trying to study Venus.

The author put a lot of bad things in his/her text about going to Venus. In paragraph 3 is states ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on out own planet. The state also states in paragraph 6 that ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photogra[hy and videography ineffective.

The author does put some good things about studying Venus. In paragraph 4 it states ""Venus was probably coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" From this state meant studying Venus could help us found out more about its past. The text also states in paragraph 6 that ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of the Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."" This is one of the few ways that a human could explore Venus.

The author had stated some good thing but yet with every good thing that he/she had stated there was always a bad. The author also did not do a good job of stating why humans need to study Venus. The author states in paragraph 8 that it is good for human curiosity. That to me is not a good enough reason to send a person to this planet with all the risk that they will have.

9D9FAA8DE032,"Would you want to be burned at 800 degrees Fahrenheit? No, that just sound to painful you might say. Scientists at NASA speculate that Venus's surface on the planet can average those temperatures. In this essay I will talk about how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit and evidence that backs my claim up thoroughly.

Going to another planet seems so dangerous and so far out of our mind that we don't think about this idea on a regular basis. The text states in paragraph 3, ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures avereage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encouter on Earth."" This quote shows how much more dangerous Venus is than Earth just simply based on the atmosphere of the planet and that harsh conditions that cover it. Another piece of evidence is this in paragraph 4, "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such asn valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of Venus seems indisputable."" This quote shows how Venus is so close geographically and distance wise to Earth based on some land features. Researchers find that getting even 30 miles from the surface of the planet the temperatures would still be at roughly 160 degrees Fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to Earth's sea level.

Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is so magnificant of a planet because we have never experienced a planet so much like our own. Our travels shouldn't be limited by dangers or doubts that we may have but should meet our endeavourous wonders and imagination of the planet and travel.    ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
929A9B862AC5,"In the article the author believes that we need to try to see more of Venus, however, going to Venus is very dangerous. Many people believe that the trip to Venus would be too dangerous given the real dangers on the planet. The author gives us both sides of the argument as to if we should keep trying to go to Venus or if we need to stop and focus our time on something less dangerous. We do have the chance to see what Venus holds because of the technology we have in todays world. It would be a very major accomplishment if we could get a person to land on Venus.

Venus is a dangerous planet, we do not know what is under the ""carbon dioxide blankets"". The author of this article says that although Venus is 97% covered in a thick atmosphere, we still hve a chance to see what is under it. One way the author included was to send a hovering vehicle to Venus and have it take pictures of the planet 30 miles abover the land. Although they do say that because of the thick carbon dioxide you would not see anyhting because the lights we have will more than likly will not be bright enough. Yet the author still believes there is a soultion to that problem and all the other ones I might add.

At the end of paragraph 5 the author says ""Not easy conditions, but suriviable for humans."" you see the author says that it is ""around 170 degrees Fahrenheit and the air pressure is close to sea level on Earth "" and it seems unlikly for a person to be able to handle the 170 degree heat let alone the air pressure. Then the author goes on to tell us that we can use a hovering car, still it is a good idea but again the pictures would not be clear at all, which would defete the idea of a hovering car. There are many good and bad things about sending things up to try and get a look at Venus, and the author seems to think there is more good than bad. They do tell us that NASA is working on taking new approches to study Venus, like he said "" some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chos of Venus"" and if that is true then we may be taking a step in the right direction.

Winding down the author says that "" striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becuase human curiosity will likly lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" this quote proves that we are going to want to try and see more planets but if we can not get close enough to one of the closest planets around us, how are we supposed to get any further. The author makes many good points in this article, we should try to go to Venus, maybe not send a person up there right away, but we need to see what Venus has in store. The universe is bigger than just our solar system, if we can not even find a way to see Venus how are we going to go anywhere else. The author shows us both sides of the argument and the good that could come from going to Venus is just amazing. It could even be the greatest accomplishment in a long time.

CC6CFE6D8CA8,"Actress and singer Audrey Hepburn once remarked, ""Nothing is impossible. The word itself say I'm possible!"" The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" agrees. They claim that although venturing to a planet that is seeminly un-explorable is dangerous, it is also a worthwhile and necessary mission. By justifying why it is crucial to continue our efforts to explore Venus, and additionally through their explanation as to how this can safely be accomplished, the author of this article strongly supports their idea that studying Venus is a noble pursuit despite the many obstacles that it creates.

One way that the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports their claim is by explaining the sheer value and benefit of going to Venus. While it is true that several conditions on Venus' surface are inhospitable and unable to support or sustain human life, the author claims that ""astronomers are fascniated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,"" (para 4). This might lead to discoveries that could help us understand or predict Earth's future evolution patterns. Besides this, Venus is at times the closest planet to Earth as ""Earth, Venus and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus,"" (2). This could be extremely beneficial to both the inhabitants of earth and for future space travel because Venus will sometimes be our ""nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,"" (4). All of these statements and claims that the author make support his/her claim that the exploration of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it entails as they are quite literally explaining to their readers why exploration is as important as it is. This tactic has the ability to make audiences aware of the importance of such a mission, and hopefully persuade them to agree.

Additionally, the author supports his/her claim by revealing how a mission to Venus can be carried out in a safe, mannerly way. This, in turn, aids in convincing readers that might have originally disgareed with the author due to the fact that Venus' ""conditions are fare more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine assustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,"" (3). The author, after making this counterclaim, refutes it by talking of some solutions to this ever-looming issue: ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape,"" (5). The author talks of how the air pressure, temperature and radiation would all be survivable for humans. Some, such as the air pressure 30 miles above Venus, would be almost identical to Earth at sea level. The author also disscusses other potential solutions, such as possibly using silicon carbide, a material that has ""been tested in a chmaber simulating the chaos of Venus' surface and [has] lasted for three weeks in such conditions,"" (7). These all are possible ways to make a trip to Venus much safer and, more importantly, they all help support the author's claim.

Overall, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a claim that although Venus has some exceptionally dangerous conditions, it is a planet worth exploring. They support this claim very well by explaining the importance of going to Venus, and providing a few solutions that might reduce the risk factor of this type of mission. All in all, this author, much like Audrey Hepburn, proves through this article that they feel that nothing is truly impossible, not even a trip to Venus. After all, like Hepburn says, the word does state ""I'm possible!""",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
F3E151A8D172,"Today there are programs like NASA that are always looking for ways to explore our planets next to us. We have already sent probes and rockets to mars for exploration, but in over 30 years we havent sent one space craft to Venus, despite it being called ""Earth's twin"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of size and density, but it is the one of the most inhospitable planets that humans can step on. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author supports his idea well by explaining the benefits of exploreing Venus despite it being so cruel for humans to walk on.

In pargraph three the author quotes that, ""almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then what we experence on Earth."" The author first explains the inhospitably of Venus to then explain that when we adapt to the conditions there are plenty of benefits and knowledge to gain from the planet. In pargraph four the author quotes that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The author explains us the value of exploreing Venus to include the fact that there could be life forms we have never saw before that have lived only on Venus. Comeing back to how the author supports his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it offers.

In pargraph five the author explains ideas NASA has that could eventually take us and machines to Venus. he quotes that, ""a vehicle hovering over Venus would advoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.""

The author adds the quote in beacuse he wants to reinforce the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it offers. But he also looks at the downsides to hovering 30 miles above the landscape, citeing that from souch a high distance light cannot penetrate the dense atomsphere and that researchers can't take samples of rock, gas, or anthing else, from a distance. The author supports his evidence by looking at bolth sides of the problem and offering possible solutions to them.

He contunes in pargraph seven citeing other NASA approaches to haveing machines last longer on the surface of Venus. That if by useing mechanical computers and simplifyed electronics made of silicon carbide they can withstand the heat alot longer. In comparson to todays modern electronics which don't use gears and levers that can be built to withstand heat. The author cites this beacuse he wants the reader to know NASA is thinking of possible ideas of sending a durable machine to Venus, to withstand the chaos of the surface and send data back to people on Earth.

In ""The Challenge of Exploreing Venus,"" the author supports his idea well that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He first explains what the dangers are like. Then explains all the benefits of exploreing Venus. Lastly he explains ideas on how to overcome the challenges to send people and machines to gather data about Venus.

25A947E0EDC5,"The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" mentions may things about all the problems with going to Venus. Then, it is said how those problems could be fixed. These are all to support the authors claim. From examining the risk vs. reward of going to mars for exploring that was used in the text and the simple soutions that have baffled the world for 3+ decades, it's clear that the author got through with the message he was trying to convey.

What I've learned fromt the text is that traveling to Venus for a fair amount of time could be a very momentus event in history, but it will be very arduous to reach that goal. There were several dangers listed; temperature, air pressure, lightning, volcanoes, etc. ""While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely"". (Paragraph 1) These were also problems that were tackled by the author. He relenquishes all of the huge problems and proves that going to Venus could be worth it.

57167C40AB58,"There are many factors that makes Venus a very challenging planet for humans to study. Although Venus is the closest planet to Earth, there are many risks that have made it a very challenging place to examine more closely. Venus is the second planet from the sun which makes it very hard to achieve missions. All of the previous missions were unmanned because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. In the article ""The Challenging of Exploring Venus,"" the author supports his claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by telling the reader about Venus's thick atmosphere, NASA's possible solution to Venus's hostile conditions, and all of the forms of light that it cannot penetrate.

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite a challenge it presents, like Venus's thick atmostphere. The planet's surface and the atmospheric pressure is much more greater than what people experience on Earth. The temperature is so much greater that it would crush a submarne. Paragraph 3 states, ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."" There are too many risks from this planet being the hottest planet in the solar system, for people to explore it. It wouldn't be safe for people to experience this incredibly hot planet.

Another challenge that studying Venus brings to the reader, is NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. Vehicles would be hovering miles above the landscape to avoid the ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. Paragraph 5 states, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" It could be very dangerous with people many miles above the surface, along with the termpature very high. Although it's survivable for humans, it's still very dangerous.

Another challenge that studying Venus brings to the reader is all of the forms of light that it cannot penetrate. Since the light isn't penetrating the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography effectively, people only receive limited insite on ground conditions on Venus. People have to look at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet to even get a little bit of insight. Paragraph 6 says, ""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" Since researchers can't take samples of things like gas, or rocks from a distance, they are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enought to help with their knowledge of Venus.

Studying Venus has many challenges to go along with it. Although studying this planet is a worthy pursuit, some dangers were presented by telling the reader about Venus's thick atmosphere, NASA's possible solution to Venus's hostile conditions, and all of the forms of light that it cannot penetrate. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system which makes it hard for people to explore it if the pressure is so high. Vehicles hover miles above the landscape to avoid the ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. Since it's so hard to get close the Venus because of its risks, people have to look at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet to even get a little bit of insight. Although there are many dangers that come with exploring Venus, people get so much out of the result if researchers get to exploring what they needed to, to inform the rest of the people.

4F9C8B013CA4,"Why should we study the Venus as a worthy pursuit? going to Venus we will discover a lot of new things that we didn't know about. When going to Venus you can give away the curiosity's that people may have on the planet. But going to Venus could be a risk factor or it can be something that we discover and put it on earth.

In the passage the author states that traviling to Veuins is going to be a challenge but is still wanting to make a pursuit to go. In paragraph five the author states that

''(NASA) has one particularly compeling idea for sending humans to study Venus''. The author states NASA to show that a very big company wants to know what is up in Venus, so it should be studieded. In paragraph eight the author states that ''Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has valued, not only because of the insights to be gained on the planet itself''. This shows that the author says taking a challnge is a good thing when you want to find something out, so take challenges. In paragrqph four the author says ''If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even disscusing further visits to its surface''. The author uses this to ask a question to have you thinking to show that even scientist are curious about the planet Venus and the readers should be to. In paragraph one the author explains what other people think about they say that Venus is a evening star so the author is saying that there are miths about Venus, so the author trys to explain that traviling to Venus will take away the curiositys so, it might be a new way to discover new things to bring back to earth to share with the world; because it can advance things. The author uses alot of questions to show what he is refering to with traviling to Venus and making the reader aprove with his oppinion. In paragraph seven he states that ''some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simbulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. This shows that NASA was conducting experiments where a computer can take such bad climate.

The author uses alot of questions to show that what they are talking about is true and they even had evidence to support there idea.

50122C17BAD4,"Today I'm writing about The Challenge of Exploring Venus. Venus is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"". Its one of the brightest points of light in the sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from the sun. While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.

First, there's a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit, and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we expreinced on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liqefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather presnt additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

However, peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atomosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to out knowledge of Venus.

Last, NASA is working on other approches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is looking back to an technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important rolein the 1940s during World War 2. The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

One of the reasons is that belive it or not venuse is the most simalar planet to earth, also the scientist at NASA said they are working on a blimp like vehicle that could go up to 30 miles high. That means if they made this structer they could avoid all of the harsh conditions on ground level at venus such as the armospheric pressure, and the unbarable heat that is a crazy total of 800 degrees. If they would make this vehicle the pressure would drop substantionaly and so would the heat from 800 degrees to around 170 degrees, the solar power and radation would also be very plentiful and wouldn't exceed Earth levels. The conditions would definetly no be easy to deal with, but they would at least be survivable. There is one problem thought people at NASA can not document their finding because of conditions which would make it where cameras could not be used. This is because the most the light cannot penetrate the dense atmospher. But there maybe a solution, the thing is we might just have to go back in time. For example scientists are looking back on older technology, this technology would be mechanical computers, this is good because these computers do not requier any technology, they use gears and levers and would be substainable on venus.

3E2B86B24659,The reason we have not got to Venus yet is because all of the dangers that are stopping us from getting there there are many reasons but the main reasons is because it is to hot to land on the surface even tho is is not the closest to then sun it is the hottest planet. So since it is the hottest planest we cant get close to it with out us burning to death. So we cant land there so we willhave to find a way to grt as close as possible without dieing. Another reason it the amount of pressure on the planet is so strong that it would crsuh a submarine that is made for going and being able to stay at a high pressurer and not crush or break but if it where to go to venus it wiuld be crudh like a person crushing a peice of paper. We think we have found a way to get close to it we could use a blimb type of system and stay 30 miles above the planet. The temputrue would still be 170 degrees and thats still hot but if used solor power from the sun it should stay nice and cool inside the blimb. The last reason is our tecnology is not strong enugh to stand the heat it would melt and then there was no point of going to take like pictures and it would kinda be a waste of money so we need tecnology that would help then stay cool and not melt because if we were to go now the temputre is so hot that it would melt ten adn melt just like butter or ice on a hot summer day. So there are meany reasosns that we cant go there yet but if the tecnology gets better and better evry year like it has been we will be able to not just go look at the planet byt to get to go on it.,2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
DE4E515FF3B9,"In the article ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" it talks about all the dangerous features that the plant Venus has. In the article it states that "" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. This is a postive thing about Venus because people may want to exploer Venus because its like earth. Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet of the solar system. This creates the idea that Venus may not be worth studing because of how dangerous it may apeal.

Despite that Venus may be seem like a dangerous planet to study its actually worth studying. Venus is worth studying because the author states that "" Venus may be well known because its the most Earth- like planet in our solar sytem. That suggest the idea that its worth studing because of its like earth and people may want to study a planet like earh. Not only is it just a planet like earth but its the only planet that is like earth in the solar system. Also Venus is worth studying because it has increiable things that happens such as erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquackes and lighting that strikesto probes seeking to land on its surface. Thoes event that take place on Venus are worth studying because the events are very exciting and intresting people may want to know more what happen on the planet Venus.

In conclusion Venus is worth studying beacuse of the exciting events that take places. Also because of how Venus is the only planet in the solar system to be like earth and people may want to learn more about how they are so similar. Despite all of the dangers Venus presents its actally worth studying because you dont have to visit the planet all you have to do is learn more about the planet and learn why its so dangerous or why its like earth and why 3 major events take place.

29C8FE930E22,"I believe that through the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" that the author has built an exellent argument for why we should explore Venus. I say this because throughout the article the author points out many of the challenges that would come up durring exploration, as well as potential solutions to them.

In paragraph three the author tells us that no previous spacecraft has been able to survive for more than a few hours. The author counters this problem in paragraph seven when they show us how simplified electronics made from silicon carbide last for weeks in simulations of Venus's conditions.

Another time the author shows us some of the most challenging problems with exploring Venus is in paragraph four when she talks about he clouds of sulfiric acid, the 800 defree Fahrenheit temperatures, volcanoes, earthquakes, lightning strikes to probes surface and atmospheric pressure much greater than here on Earth. They go on to explain, in paragraph five, a solution to this problem would be to make vehicles that would fly thirty miles above the landscape where the conditions are nowhere near as hostile with temperature of 170 degrees, and air pressure similar to Earth. This solution not only solves the problems of being on the surface but also comes with the advantage of having solar power.

In paragraph six the author states that from the thirty mile height above the the vehicle could not easily photograph the surface or take samples of the planet. She debates this in the same paragraph when they tell us that scientist are currently working on machinery that could contribute meaningful knowlege about Venus.

In conclusion trying to explore Venus cold be potentially dangerous, but possible. All of the problems the author has shown us have potential solutions, and the exploration could contribute to the knowlege of Venus.

Geological formations on Venus are also similar to those of Earth and by exploring those formations on Venus we could learn a lot about our home planet.

However, the author does not go beyond these assertions and does not provide ample evidence to support that exploring Venus is fundamentally worthy, the author even counter argues explaining that Venus is, and could be, a dangerous human indeavor; not to mention that it is challenging enough just to get there.

Ultimately, the author does not make a strong enough arguement to support the idea of exploring Venus for the benefit of humanity and of Earth.

The author explains the theory of having a balloon like space station that can protect humans from the deadly environment of Venus's surface in paragraph 5.

This possibility however is countered by the uselessness that the author then explains in paragraph 6 writing, ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions.""

It is interesting that the author does not explain that the exploration of Mars, for instance, could be a much safer future indeavor.

In paragraph 2 the author mentions Mars as one of our neighbors but then does not procede to use it in any part of the rest of the article.

By doing so makes it look like he/she intentionally did so for the betterment of his/her own idea.

This article, in the mind of the reader, feels counter intuitive because the author provides more evidence to support the idea that exploring Venus is not worthwhile.

The author explains in paragraph 6, ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.""

In paragraph 3, the author initially explains that the surface of Venus's ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet[,]"" these conditions are instantaneously deadly to humans and do not provide an argument that would support exploration of such a deadly environment.

Space exploration agencies like NASA have sent in the past, autonomous landing craft to the surface of Venus; none of which have ""survived the landing for more than a few hours.""

If the best of humanitie's technologies have been unable to conduct any worthwhile field work in the name of science and the only possible solution is to use ""old technology called mechanical computers[,]"" (paragraph 7) then how would such a computer be able to send a message back to Earth?

The author's article about the exploration of Venus is lacking in just about every available aspect of being worthwhile or viable ideas.

The author makes a good argument, but for the opposite idea that he/she is trying to explain.

It states in paragraph two,"" Each mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in the more than three decadeas."" This peice of evidence shows that Venus is not a safe enviroment for electronics to land on so why would you potentially send humans to this planet even though a spacecraft couldn't surive. This statement also had no followup counterarguement; there was no sentence to make me want to change my mind.

It also states in paragraph three,"" On the planets surface, temperatures avergae over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" This piece of the paragraph again identifies the risks but now into more detail. There is no followup counterargument, so again this author is making me completely against the idea of sending life to Venus.

It states in paragraph four,""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This statement is one of the only pros that I have encountered from the author so far. This makes me think that this could be a good idea, especially due to the fact that Venus has some of the same features of earth.

The author then goes on to say,"" imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as out jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At the thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit. But the air pressure would be close to that of se level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This paragraph finally gives a safe solution to exploring Venus in a habitable way.

There is no point doing this exploration because any human life will not survive if you get too close to the surface.

For an example Venus is the second planet from our sun, Venus has the most highest temperature than any other planet, and NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. There's so many things that can put someone in danger or at risk.

First, Venus is the second plant away from Earth. Venus can have alot of intresting things, people could probably live there, but no one has thought about the risks about being there. In the text it says ""Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth..."" It is more dificult to study Venus knowing how close it is to us. It is more challenging to examine since it's way closer than any other planet.

Second, Venus has the most hightest temperatue than any other planet. In the text it says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun"" Out of any planet that isn't to close to the sun or Earth had to be the hottest. Would humans be ready if the really going to get sent to Venus be able to go? knowing how hot the temperature is. A humans temperature is 98 degress Fehrenheit. The conditions there are so extreme than humans on Earth like high pressure and heat. The weather is so different and since it is very hot then it is more likely to present ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes"" and more things like that.

Third, NASA has an idea of sending humans to study Venus. How would you react if someone said ""Hey, you're going to Venus"" like woah. The first that should pop in your head should be to research because you can't just go without knowing what's really going on out there. NASA think that they should send humans out there to study Venus, if it is safe for humans to go. In the text it says ""Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface."" There is many ways NASA wants to study Venus by forms of photography and videography, but they cant because they also cannot sample rock, gas from a distance.

9C6C90C996C5,"Imagine being convinced that completing a certain task is worth any strugles along the way, and you end up severely hurt because of it. That is exaclty what the author of this article is trying to do. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author does a poor job of supporting the idea that studying a planet as dangerous as Venus is worth it. Studying Venus is a terrible idea because technology isn't advanced enough, it would take years to discover anything beneficial, and the costs' of this, both in money and lives, are outrageous.

Technology throughout the world has improved since the 1900's,however, it has improved on Earth and in regards to Earthly tasks. When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion"". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but ""survivable"". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea.

Exploring unmarked territory isn't something that can be done over night. Unmarked territory is exactly what Venus is. Even if technology did evolve enough so that humans could visit this planet, it would takes years, decades, even centuries, to accomplish. In the article, the author continously offers alternatives for exploration. He does this is paragraphs' 5,6, and 7 where he gives examples of organizations that are working towards this exploration. However in all of the paragraphs, the author seems to only be giving ""what if"" scenarios or in some cases just simple ideas that have been thought about and are possibly being examined. He fails to provide any real data or statistics for these things, except when he mentions the simplified electronics in paragraph 7. Even then, those devices are only able to survive for 3 weeks, so it would still take many years to just improve those devices. Also, in paragraph 6 the author states, ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". This statement is very broad, and it does not key in on any form of information that should lead us to believe that to be true. These details from the passage prove my point on the amount of years it would take, as well as the fact that nobody has any idea how long. The question to be asked here is, ""Is it worth the wait?"". For these reaons I stand behind my claim that the author supported the idea of exploring venus very poorly.

Assuming that the exploration of Venus does eventually happen one day, how much money would go into it, how many lives? These are all questions that need to be considered when brainstoming the idea of visitng another planet. The author of this article is avoiding all of these mainstream problems by simply saying it's worth the risks, when it actaully is not. In paragraph 3, the author explains all of the dangers of Venus and how they can affect humans. He explains, "" On the planet's surface, the temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Considering that this is true, we can definitrly assume that condition on Venus are severly dangerous, and a lot of people may get hurt trying to explore it. The aurthor also states, "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oeans and would liquefy many metals. What the author is stating here is that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions on Venus. This means that in order to explore Venus we have to design all new machinery, which would cost a lot of money, not to mention the human costs as we would need humans to test things out. He also makes it notable that venus has the hottest surface of any planet, despite not being the closest to the sun. All of these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety as well as propr functioning of machines. Even if exploring Venus was a possibilty, would it be even be worth it after all of he human costs and money costs or paid. What we are discussing here is putting human lives at risk, and spending a ton of money on a project that is no where near being ready ready to present. These reasons as well as the provided facts assure me on my claim that the author did a terrible job of supporting this idea of exploration.

In conclusion, since our technology isn't advanced enough, it would take far too many years to do, and the human and money costs wuold be outrageously high, we should not explore Venus. Exploring Venus proves to be very dangerous, and we have proved that we are no where near being ready for such a task. We would first need to advance our technology for the task. This would take years to due, it would also use up a ton of money, and put people in serious danger. The author did a terrible job of supporting the idea that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dnagers it presents. For one, there were not enough facts presented in the article that were beneficiary to the idea. Also, of the pros that were present, the cons outweighed then tremendously.

65B27DB7CE43,"The planet Venus is also known as the ''Evening Star,"" due to how it is one of the brightest points of light in the sky during the night. Venus is also sometimes referred as the Earth's ''twin,'' this is because Venus is the closest of the planets to Earth when comparing density size, and occasionally distance. Even though Venus is safe to see from a distance, but it has been proven that Venus is extremely dangerous when to close. Venus's physical conditions are so lethal that trying to study the planet isn't worth the risk.

Furthermore, An article called ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" states reasons otherwise, as how a way a human can examine Venus with a special kind of technology. Venus's conditions are so lethal that trying to study the planet isn't worth the risk. The atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide surrounds Venus. Along with the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere of Venus. In addition to, the planets conditions are very high compared to Earth. For example, in paragraph 3 it states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.""

This information reveals how lethal the planet Venus truly is when compared to Earth.

Secondly, NASA is working with an old electronic that further supports the idea of studying Venus. Even though this electronic is stated to survive the lethal conditions of Venus, it isn't going to be retrievable from the surface of Venus, as humans can only get as close as 3 miles from Venus's surface. Including, the piece of technology is extremelly old and outdated. For example, in paragraph 7 it states, ""These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War ll."" This information proves against the authors point, and shows how invailed and outdated the technology is.

To conclude, The study of Venus was attempted and failed. Knowing more information about Venus will have no purpose because the living conditions are unstable. Venus's conditions are so lethal that trying to study the planet isn't worth the risk.

The temperatures are way to high and the air quality is sad. There is no technology at this moment that can survive the extreme physical conditions of Venus. Even if the technology is new or old. After all, Earth is ten times better.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
43956F2F62B4,"The author evaluated their ideas about visiting Venus well in their essay, however, they did have some aspects that could be improved upon. Their introduction lacked a strong thesis which can have a negative impact on the rest of the essay if their claims aren't strongly proven. Despite their weak thesis, their claims made later in the essay were strongly proven. Not only did the author give basic background knowledge of venus and two main reasons as to why studying venus could benefit the human race, but they also gave a solution to the dangers that came with exploring the planets..

In the introduction paragraph, the author didn't give a strong thesis to state their clame. When making a thesis you want to include what claims you will be covering in the essay and what you are trying to prove. The only claim the author gave was in the last sentence of the paragraph where they stated,"" It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" They didn't give specifics as to what claims they will make to prove that Venus should be examined and their vocabulary seemed limited when they used the word ""very.""

Throughout the second and third paragraphs of the essay, the writer gave background knowledge of Venus compared to Earth. This was a good decision because they later used some of the facts that were stated to strengthen their reasoning as to why Venus should be visited and examined. They stated how hard it was to examine Venus and how dangerous the planet was for life. The planet would not be able to sustain human life due to it's harsh terrain and harsh weather. One of the reasons scientists are studying Venus is because they believed that Venus looked like what modern-day Earth does at one point. The writer bringing up how unhabitable Venus is strengthens their argument on why we need to study Venus and their belief that because this happened to Venus, then it could potentially happen to Earth.

Writing about how Venus used to be like Earth and why that's important is a strong point to support the writers claim. When writing a persuasive or argumentative essay, including how what the author is writing about can benefit the reader is a way to persuade the reader to agree with the author. In the essay, the writer talks about two different ways that learning about Venus can benefit the human race. The first reason has to do with benefiting the way that humans are able to survive on Earth. Finding out what changed Venus to become inhabitable can stop the potential for the same to happen to Earth. The next reason they argued, in paragraph 4, was that if something happens to Earth, Venus is in close proximity. One day, the Earth's surface may become dangerous for human life and humans must flee to the nearest planet to survive. The author believes that finding out the exact conditions of Venus and finding a way to sustain human life on the planet would greatly benefit the human races future.

Lastly, the writer gives a solution to the most important problem stated in the essay, that it would be difficult for humans to live on Venus or even visit it. Throughout the fifth and sixth paragraph, the author talks about how research has already been done to find ways for humans to live on Earth. They even provide ideas of the their own for how humans can live on Venus. Pointing out problems with your ideas but then solving them is a strong way to argue your point because it eliminates the question of ""will it fail?"" and might answer some questions that readers have when reading the essay.

Overall, the author argues their points well. The structure of their essay has some aspects that can and should be changed, such as the introduction paragraph. The author showed why their claim was important to the reader and answered the ""how will it be done?"" part of their claim. Answering the ""how will it be done?"" part of the claim can eliminate doubt among the reader and strengthen the argument that the writer is trying to get across to the reader.

63A014130F9E,"How many people do you know that would like to go to the Moon? Many I'm sure, but why would they want to risk their life just to see another planet? Well, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" has a theory that this exploration is a very worthy pursuit despite its many visible challeneges and dangers.

The authors first allegation is that human curiosity is taking over and will lead us to many finds beyond our planet of Earth. While you may not worry about Venus and what it looks like every day, just think, wouldn't it be facsinating if there was another hospitable planet besides Earth? Venus was once the most earth-like planet in our solar system, and that statement is what makes astronomers so intrigued by the idea of someday going there. Venus is known to have a sufrace of rocky, valleys, mountains, and craters, so what would make the mission safe for humans and effective for scientists?

The author also says, although nondeliberately, that humans have the supplies to one day explore Venus, but doesnn't make the effort to. The author makes the conclusion that ""peering at venus from a ship safely far above"" isn't going to cut it. The words used by the author are supported because not only can you not get reliable resources, they could be ineffective and just a waste of time. Instead, researchers need to take the challenge and work on innovations that allow machines to last long enough to contribute to the exploration of Venus.

While the author believes there are a number of dangers in the exploration, it is stated that instead of feeling like there is a risk to you, think of them as challenges that you will one day overcome. As of now NASA is simplifying electronics because modern technology may be quick and powerful, but it becomes delicate in aggrivating physical conditions such as heat.

Overall, the author is stating that despite dangers presented, exploring Venus could be a great investment for the long run. So next time you are asked of what the future could hold for you, just think it may be a trip to Venus.                      ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
A4FB165016A2,"The author believes that Venus should be able to be explored. Venus should should be explored even though there are many dangerous weather conditions and things that could interfere with a mission. The author believes this because nothing should be able to stop humans from expanding their knowledge. In the article the author describes Venus in several ways which are the similarity to Earth's size,weather type, distance, and how dangerous it is.

Here is an example from paragraph 2 of how its similar to Earth and its' size. ""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" What he is saying in this sentence is that Venus isn't very different from Earth and that they are close to each other in distance and sometimes farther apart than they normally are.

Another example in paragraph 2 is how dangerous it is. Even though the author does not state the word dangerous he describes how dangerous it is by stating, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" In this sentence he is describing that Venus is way too dangerous for a human to step foot on because not even a spaceship can surive for more than a day.

An example he gives of a challenge in Venus is the weather or climate. Here is an example from the article, paragraph 5, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but thr air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" Here the author decribes venus as being very hot without a human touching the ground yet.

All of this adds up to humans having a challenges on Venus. Humans are very strong and will find a way to survive on Venus because they have already tested some simple electronics made up of silicon and the outcome was that the electronic survived for a couple of weeks. This wouldnt be easy for a human but it would be normal difficulty.                            ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
8127AE26E15A,"The Author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents very well in this writting. Teh author is good at showing the two diffrernent sides to the agument but makes you agree with his stance. He used many diffrent examples and also gae a lot of detail in his writting.

To start off his essay with some facts and expalined what he was going to be talking about and some things about planets. One fact he used to start his essay off was "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" ( paragraph 3) This was a great way to start off the writting because he informed his readers about venus before he started to persaude them on a topic.

The author also displaces the oposing information which is always a good thing to do in a pusasive writting. An example of this is "" Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for human."" ( Paragraph 5) This is higlighing that yes Venus has some dangerous things but is still worthy. So by doing this he is showing the dangers but then can back them up and say some good things about them.

Following this, The author was really good at making the dangerous stuff sound not as bad, one example of this is ""Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely for above teh planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrated the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" (paragraph 6) This supports that he is a good authour and deplaning his stance on the agurmeny becasue he can make the other side information help his stance in an way.

In conclusion, the author did a great job at suporting his idea. The diffrent ways of supporting it made it seem more persasive and he got across alot of ideas and information.                  ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
9617F3315041,"Have you every wanted to go visit Venus or just see it through a telascope? Well NASA have been tryign to go and see Venus, and sent robots and other things there to take picture or recording what is going over on the planet. The are a few problems with sending humans to Venus and things could go wrong if we are not prepared to go there. But here is a few problem with sending humans there.

Venus is very common to earth and some call it our sister. It will be very hard to try to have humans walk on planet Venus. In the text it says that ""On the planet sruface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenhit, and the atmospheric, pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". That means it is going to very hard to withstand the temperature on Venus surface.

Another problem is that in the text it say that "" Beyond high presure and heat Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land."" What that mean is that is very challenging to send human on Venus and it could destroy the space ship and other things NASA sends.

Even though Venus has though things as well as earth they both are still very much in common. Studies have shown that Venus has have largely oceans and could have supported life on the planet just like Earth. But still Venus do have some landscape features just like earth. Venus have valleys, mountains, and craters all the same as earth.

Taking a trip to Venus will be a challenge and it will happen some day. NASA will some figure out a way to get there. But Venus is still a little different from earth and dangerous. Venus do have some simliiar like features as earth do. And the planet will remain earths sister.    ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
089A47979C9E,"I would say that planning a trip to Venus is a worthy idea and pursuit because scientists can go there and collect samples of rocks and gases. They could be able to see things and stuff they have never seen before. The problem would be that scientists and explorers would probably not be able to return back to Earth to examine the samples because Venus's Surface is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and they won't be able to survive on the surface for a long period of time.

Inseead of using electronics, we can use mechanical computers which are more ridgid and less fragile in extreme weather and environment conditions. These mechanical computers are worthy because they were used in World War II. These mechnical computers were made to withstand the extreme of weather and environmental conditions.

Some examples include the following, "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide covers Venus"". ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"".

In paragraph 4 he says ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even dicussing further visits to its surface"" That statement from the passage doesn't seem like it would come from someone who supports the idea.

The other reason I personally believe he doesnt really support this is because when you read passages of people supporting ideas, they dont really go into the negative things that could happen. The author of this went well into detil of the hazards and dangers that can occur on venus. In paragraph 5 he says "" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" He is saying that even after NASA figures out a way to make it to Venus, it would still be extremely difficult but you probably won't die.

My conclusion of this passage is that the author does not fully support the topic he is writing about and for many reasons. Yes, Venus may have had a good enviroment that could have sustained human life in the past but it doesn't anymore. I think we should stop trying to explore somewhere that could harm you.

Knowning we have other plantes that are surrounding us amd there are probaly a lot of cool things we can do out there, does sound pretty fun and cool. Most people would ask, when we get there wont we die or not even make it? Well

I´m going to chnage your mind and tell you why should vistit venus and discover all the things there,and maybe later you can think about visting he rest of the solor system.

As we all know venus is pretty close to earth. They even sometimes call it our ¨Evening star¨ or even the ¨twin¨ of earth. They feature a lot earths density and size. They really only deffer in speed ¨sometimes we are closer to mars and other times we are closer to Venus, because Venus is soetimes right around the corner¨. In my option venus is like another sun, it has the brighest points in the sky and is a very hard plantet to even look at because of its brigtness.

I´m sure we have we have all seen picture Venus or have heard story about what venus looks like or even the solor system. The pictures we have seen are sometimes close but not all the way, I´m sure there is way more background to what we know than what sciecntist know or have discovered over the last years. Astronomers are fascienated by Venus out of all plantes because¨long ago Venus may looked just like earth today.¨ Some say that Venus was probaly just like out plant, filled with water, liek a ocean type form or even have some features to our way of life. On the other hand we all know that´s not what Venus looks like today. Some say Venus still has have some features that is like earth but learning from NASA¨the plantet is like a rocky sediemnt but also have some cool feathures like valleys, mountains and maybe even creaters.¨

Finally we should just meet any imaginations that is bring upon us, even if we know we shouldn´t or it can put us in some type of ¨danger¨, you only live once so u might as well take a chance and do what you can. Even through it might take years for it to happen its worth seeing new things outside of earth. sceinctists says that we ¨cant take samples of rocks, gas or anything esle, from distance¨ hopefully they can find a way we can so if we do send people to Venus they can bring back things for us to look at. More likely I´m sure they are having resecahers working on things to allow people to go on a long lasting mission. Scienctist have thought about bringing back old technology called ¨mechincail computers, they played a important role¨.

That´s how we know and got all the info we got till this day.

38F668E609B3,"Venus is the hottest planet in our solar sytem. It could also be one of the most dangerous planets too. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author thinks its a good idea to strive furter into exploring Venus even with the dangers the planet contains.

One of the reasons the author beleives we should keep finding new things about Venus is because it was though to be similar to Earth. Venus and Earth are even called ""twins"" because they are thought to be so alike. Venus was thought to once be covered in oceans that could have possibly supported life at a point in time. Venus also contains similar things to Earth like valleys, mountains, and craters. The only way we could figure more things out about Venus would be if we cept sending thigs such as rovers to research it and possibly humans one day.

Another reason the author thinks we should find more information about Venus is because Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth in our solar system aside from Mars. Venus or Mars would be the next step in our space exploration. If we do send rovers or people to Venus one day, we would need things that could withstand the heat and other chaos that happens on the surface of Venus. The author states that NASA has came up with an idea that contained a blimp-like vehicle that would hover about 30 miles above the surface of Venus that would carry scientists and would allow them to study the surface. The temperatures inside the blimp would be about 170 dagrees Fahrenhet and air pressure that would be close to sea level on Earth. The conditions would be rough, but humans can withstand it.

Though Venus is dangerous, that doesnt mean it's not possible for humans or rovers to explore its surface one day. Humans are driven by curiosity that leads us into similar places. If we can make it to the Moon, we can most likely one day make it to Venus and back. If humans were to one day even land on Venus, it would be a giant achivement for the human race.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

What type of danger is causing issues for us to find answers?

Scientist have sent spacecraft to planet to research and get evidence, but theres been a few issues. They have tried sending spacecraft to Venus but they have not had a sucessful one in over 3 decades. The thing about Venus is that it's temperature reach around 800 degrees fahrenhait, the atmosphere pressure is 90 times more than ours. Which can cause many issues for spacecrafts.

Scientist have found that earthquakes, volcanoes, and even lighting are located on Venus. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" they say the believe that Venus might just have been the most Earth-Like planet. How? they believe that at some point Venus was the home to oceans, valleys, mountains, and even could support certain life form. What if there right? but they can only know if they have true evidence from Venus.

What if Venus was once a place where life could live, what happened? Scientist have been working hard on creating a spacecraft that can handle heat, but also pressure. ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" they talk about working with NASA. They came up with the idea that maybe if we create a type of hovering car that could be close the Venus, but not on Venus. A car that could handle some pressure and some heat, without being destroyed.

First reason it is a good things to study about a different planet because if we all just studying about Earth it will be getting boring, and we won't know anything about the other planet. According to the text "" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" When I read this quote I was already excited to learn about Venus. As we study something different the more we are become smart.

Secodn reason, in the past nobody know that Venus is a planet because they thought Venus was one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. According to the text "" Venus, sometimes called the "" Evening Star"". They are having thought about Venus like because they haven't never see Venus or study about the Venus.

First,In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author says ""Earth's ""Twin"", Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size"". Since it has a lot in common with Earth it is good to have a litle insight on this planet. In the article it says that"" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features sich as valleys, moutains, and craters"" this shows how much Earth and venus have incommon. This also gives us an opertunity to take a planetary visit to Venus in the future. Despite the dangers it could cause on someone.

In the article is says"" Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperatue of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the Sun"" This is another example of how dangers Venus is.

Despite Venus being the hottest planet in our solar system.

Then, on that note Venus is not the cloestet planet to the sun but has the highest tempature than all of your planet's in the solar system. However studying Venus can give us insight on what to make to prevent for somone or something burning on its surface.

In the second line of the paragraph, the author states, ""Austronomers are facinated by Venus because it may once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This peice from the article shows that researchers, or astronomers, are intrigued by Venus because of it's simularities with Earth. Then the author goes into more detail about what those simularites are, in the same paragraph he states, ""Venus was probably convered largely with oceans and could have supported varius forms of life, just like Earth."" In this sentence the author expands upon what those simularites are, and how the planets are similar because of their attributes, such as the support of different life forms. The detail the author inserted into the article about the resemblance of oceans is significant because life is not possible without oceans, and Venus had them.

Both peices of evidence that support what claims the author made as to why research into Venus was a good idea came from the same paragraph. The other seven paragraphs of the article expand upon why exploration isn't possible, how scientists and researchers are trying to overcome the difficulties that the planet provides them with, and what dangers there are. Only one paragraph from the article supports why exploration is intriguing to scientists. In this paragraph, the author supports why exploration towards Venus is being chased, such the similar physical characterists and the possiblity of life. The author doesn't support that idea of further exploration to Venus adequetly because they don't provide enough claims. There are two statements supporting why scientists are facinated by Venus. Why studying Venus is a worthy persuit is a minor detail in the article, the author does not do a well enough job in supporting the motivations behind the scientists.

D9EF753929F4,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy dispute despite the dangers very efficiently and clearly. They clearly explain the argument in the second paragraph. They also properly list all the advantages to exploring Venus and then weighed it out with the challenges and risks that would stand in the way. They finally finish by stating their claim once more in their concluding paragraph.

To start their article, they begin in paragraph 2 by stating some facts about the planet and a bit of history to go into it, which helps us understand Earth's history with Venus itself. In Paragraph 2, it states, ""Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner - in space terms - humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours... ...not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. "" This explains that we have tried to land spacecrafts onto Venus to study the planet before, and have failed, therefore causing us to give up until now, which is where our argument comes into play.

The argument for this article is simply ""Should we try to study Venus again?"" and the author believes we should, after they weighed out some of the challenges that were in our way then and are in our way now. Paragraph 3 states ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet."" These facts are about the surface of the planet, and as the author also states in paragraph 3, ""these conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and liquefy any metals.""

The author then asks at the beginning of paragraph 4, ""if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" Then proceeds to explain, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This explanation tells us that Venus could have been exactly like Earth, and may even still be in certain ways. Their explanation continues with, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" Using this information, we could theoretically use Venus as a second Earth, or maybe a pitstop on the way to other planets, or as a way to research for other lifeforms, which is worth the risks that come with it, and that's what the author is trying to say when asking, ""The Value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?""

The author explains that, ""The... ...Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" The author continues to go on and explain that NASA has a plan to make a vehicle that would hover over Venus and observe from above, where the conditions would be less severe. they continue, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This means that their solution would be managable, but not perfect.

For their final paragraph, they restate their claim, saying ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This proves that they believe it will lead us further if we listen to our curiosity versus when we don't follow through due to risks. They also state ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" which backs up their claim.

86D1ED054ECA,"If Venus is so inhospiable, why are some scientist discussing visits to its surface? ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is abut the risk and how hard it is for our technology to survive Venus' surface to explore. This is how the author supports his ideas of studying Venus.

Here are some of the authors claims on why it is imortant and worth it to explore Venus. The author thinks that studying venus is a worthy persuit despite all of the dangers that come with exploring the planet. The author says that astronomers are facinated by Venus because it it could have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. Also becuas Venus was porbably covered mostly in oceans meaning that life forms could have lived on the planet. The planet also has rocky sedement, valleys, mountains, and craters just like Earth. Venus can also be our nearest option because space travel takes such a long period of time. Because of these reasons the author thins that Venus is worth exploring eventho the risk is so high.

In ""The Challenge of Ecploring Venus,"" the author has supported his ideas. The author said that Venus is most Earth like and could have also suported life long ago. Also that it sometimes the closest option for exploration. I think that we should explore Venus more If our technology advances enough to allow us to explore safely.          ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
9BE522EE641E,"Although it seems that the main reason for trying to explore and study Venus is just to learn more about the planet, however the author does have another reason. They believe that exploring Venus will allow the human race to conduct more dangerous missions. The author mentions several improvement to our technology and methods of exploration that are proving to be more usefull in trying to learn more about Venus.

Firstly, the author mentions that Venus is the planet most similar to Earth, however, it is more dangerous. In Paragraph 3, it is mentioned that the planet's surface temperature can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmosphere is almost completely made of carbon dioxide making it inhabiltal. Yet, the author mentions several ways that NASA is trying to overcome these obstacles. To begin with, in Paragraph 5, it is mention that NASA believes that a possible solution could be creating a vehicle that would hover about 30 miles above the surface. This vehicle would allow astronauts to remain near Venus without having to stay on the planet's dangerous surface. However this idea won't actually help astronauts study Venus, since the dense atmosphere won't allow any visible sign of the surface without getting closer. Although unable to help astronauts to actually explore Venus, this vehicle can be used as a type of station or base near Venus to collect research or as shelter to the astronauts. This vehicle could be used on different planets as well; eventually, there could be a base on any planet that is too dangerous for mankind. This could be one of the many possible ways to improve our abilities for future space travel. Improvements like these are why the author believes that the human race should continue to try to study Venus.

More important changes for space exploration are the improvements in out technology.

In Paragraph 6 it is mentioned that our current forms of taking pictures and videos can't be used unless close to the ground; however, the materials for these devices would melt if they're too close to the surface. For planets similar to Venus, with hazardes surfaces and inmense heat, a possible solution can be using old technology. Looking back at the article, in Paragraph 7 some simplified devices last longer in conditions resembling Venus. Another use of simplier and older technology can be the use of mechanical computers to send and collect information. Since these computers don't require electronics to work they can be built of stronger materials that can overcome all the challenges found on Venus. Like mentioned in the previous paragraph, these new changes are why the author believes that mankind should keep trying to explore Venus because it will all help in future explorations to similarly dangerous planets.

In conclusion, the author supports the idea that studying Venus is worth persuing despite the dangers because it can help in trying to explore similar planets. The advances that are made in trying to explore Venus can change the future of space travel in ways never seen before. These new explorations can lead the human race to explore the entire galaxy and maybe find life within the stars. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
1D7ACD8733C8,"In "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that Venus represents.

In the text it gives multiple reasons that Venus is dangerouse. Venus cann be a dnager to things that go on in space and the diffrent things that happen in space.

In the text it states that "" Venus is the closet planet to earth in terms of density and size"" This is stating that venus is the closet planet to earth so if something happpens to Venus then it couold effecct earth. In the text it says "" A thick Atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus."" When iI think of that statement it scares me. The reasont the statement above scares me is because th4e carbon dioxide that is on Venus could coem to earth and start puliting the air. Pullution in the air is not good for our animals or hummans.

I feel liek the author did a very good job at explaining why it is a good idea that studying Venus is a worthy despute inspite the dangers of studying Venus. I feel like the author could probablly give more backround on why it is not very safe to study Venus. I feel like the author could give more information why it is a good idea to prsue studying Venus.

D188D412CFC1,"Curiosity is a characteristic that is in everybody and sooner or later it forces us to explore and create new things. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" says that it is hard to explore venus but he supports exploring Venus very well.

The author says that Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin and that it may once have been just like Earth. He says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This could mean that we could find remnants of an old civilization that died many ages ago. We could see what happened to them and see if there is any other form of life still alive today. Even if people say that it can't be explored because the conditions on Venus will destroy the technology we send to it, scientists are developing new ways. Scientists are working with a very old technology with cogs and wheels because they will be more durable than electronics on Venus.

All in all the Author supported the study of Venus very well. I think that if anyone heard that Venus most likely used to be like Earth, used to have life on it, and could possibly still have life on it would want it to be explored. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
74F9B8E95F1E,"Exploring Venus seems very interesting when thinking about it. All of the beneficial things that we can study and analyze. Studying other planets have always been helpful to mankind and helps people gain insight on our solar system around us. But at the same time exploring these planets are very dangerous too. Not because of animals or humans but because of the harsh living conditions on other planets. So I will tell you why I think exploring Venus is not worth the pursuit of exploring.

My first reason of why I think Venus is not worth the pursuit is because of the difficulty of exploring Venus. In paragrpah 6 it states that ships orbiting over Venus with lights can't see the ground because of the dense atmosphere. Which makes it hard for scientists because if you can't see anything you can't analyze any data that you get because of Venus's features. But it does state that NASA is trying to find new ways of exploring Venus but it's not as good as hands on exploration. Which is good but most likely not good enough to find out what they want about the planet.

My second reason of why I think Venus is not worth the exploration is because of Venus's conditions and features. When reading about Venus the conditions are very extreme compared to the conditions on Earth. Such as clouds filled with highly corrosive sulfuric acid or temperatures that average over 800 degrees. Making it the planet with the hottest surface temperature even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Also the atmospheric pressure is great enough to crush an accustomed submarine that would be able to dive into the deepest parts of the ocean and liquifies metals. But having similarities to Earth such as erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and etc.

So in conclusion I feel that Venus should not be a planet we heavily invest in and scientists should try other planets before Venus. Because of the harsh conditions that it would have on humans. Because of the difficulty in analyzation. Making Venus a non-reliable source compared to others. So that is why I think that Venus is not worth exploring. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
C4B1A031109A,"The author does not support his idea well. He talks about more of the cons than the pros of visiting Venus, and not really about how serious this trip could be if we do the trip. He thinks that because it was once a planet like Earth that it would still be safe, yet it is very dangerous. It is more dangerous than safe. No spacecraft has survived the landing of the trip, so what expects the author to assume people will. Right, he thinks by studying more about Venus, and building protection machines will help, but with the weather of Venus it will most likely get destroyed.

The author does not supposrt his self much by saying it is the hottest, had a lot of water, and 97% acid . More sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. He saying that it was also onece like Earth, which is a good thing, but Venus is not Earth much anymore. The text states, ""Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting vlocanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on it is suface."" So either way you are basically die having to go to Venus. He listed some more than bad. The fact that it is the hottest planet in our earth system is not good. Some of the good of having to exolore Venus is that it is sometimes our closer option to spce traveling, but a sad part is that there is a insisputable ways of you returuning.

If you do end up making it to Venus and landing, there's and small chance of you dying by the weather there.

The author did not support his idea because he put more of the cons into the article than the pros. He did have some pros, but they did not really halp with the argument because the cons just ruled over them. He should have done more research on the pros, or listed less cons. In the last paragraph, 8, the author states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" is technically not true. It is not true because if you are willing to out a life in a rocket and not have any doubts is scary. You are gonna have doubts, but it is not as though you want to have them. You do not want someone to loose their life because you did not care. By having doubts, you are pretty much shwing you care, and that you do not want anything to go wrong.

A38F35A9F711,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" stated that meeting the challenge of exploring Venus is valuable because it will provide more knowledge of the planet, but also because humans will be curious about many dangerous things in the future. The author stated many dangers and doubts of exploring the planet, but then described solutions that may or may not work. It is contradictive that he decided to include facts and data that went against his own thoughts because he came back and listed data that went against the negative statements. The author created confusion to what he actually believes.

The author of the article described Venus as Earth's ""twin."" That suggests that we already know some facts about Venus such as it's density and size, which is enough to make people curious to how much about Venus we already know. He said that we know that Venus has many similar structures to Earth, such as mountains, valleys, and craters. If Venus is Earth's ""twin,"" doesn't mean that it is extremely similar to Earth? The statement could make people curious about how close Venus really is to Earth, or it could make them wonder why we should bother risking people's safety if we already know that Venus is just like Earth. The author needed to be clearer on which way he wanted people to view that statement.

The author also brought up the dangers of visiting Venus multiple times. Then, he would proceed to follow the statement with tested and untested solutions. It was hard to tell which way he sided. According to the author, ""Venusian geolegy and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes..."" He later stated that NASA has a possible idea to send blimp-like vehicles to travel the surface of Venus, but that would not provide a detailed enough view of the ground. In order to get his point across to the audience, he should not have kept going agianst information.

The author went off topic throughout the article. The different information created slight confusion as to what the message he was trying to convey. The author stated that NASA is working on an approach to studying Venus that involves mechanical computers. He then said, ""The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers..."" It is irrelevant to the message when the mechanical computers were envisioned or the fact that it is shocking to hear that computers existed in 1940. It was hard to understand why computers were important to the article at all. The author made it difficult to focus on the message when he was stating random facts that were not important to the idea he was trying to support.

The author did not make it extremly obvious as to what he was truly trying to convey. If he would been more clear and less contradictive, then it would have been more obvious that he supports the idea that Venus is worthy of being explored.

At first, in the beggining of the passage, he made a explanation of the Venus by comparing to the Earth. He first explain that Venus and Earth are similar in terms of density, size, and distance. Then he states that there are thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets in Venus, and their temperature and pressure is really high compared to Earth. This information that author gives us is great because readers can get backgroung information that can understand the missions and their risks that author will going to explain in the later passage.

Second, he talks about the mission and their pros and cons. First, He says that NASA is seeking for sending humans to study Venus, but it has difficulities. However, author says that it's avoidable. For example, temperatures in Venus is very high, but their air pressure is close to that of sea level on Earth, so it's survivable for humans. This supports the idea clearly that readers can know it's possible to travel to Venus.

Finally, author pursuades the readers. It's valuable to meet the challenge to send humans to Venus. Peering safely at Venus from ship can't collect anything. We need to conduct a mission to take samples of rock, gas, or anything else. As you can see, author is pursuading the readers that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

FF8C5B9C3EBF,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports his idea by using various different pieces of evidence while implementing the reality of the potentially dangerous exploration. The new developments in technology put furth a new pathway of innovation in reserach. With the new advancements in technology, scienctist are able to discover many similarities between Venus and Earth. The similarities also bring to view the danger of the planet Venus itself. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because of the new advancements in technology, the similarities between the two planets, and the possible challenges of researching the untamed planet.

The ever growing advancement in technology allows for the further reasearch of the neighboring planet Venus. For example when the author says, ""another project is looking back to an old technology"" to gain insite of what previously worked and what could be improved. Another piece of evidence is when the author states an improvement that can be made, ""Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant"". The greater and never ending advancements in technology allows scientist to explore the vast similarities between our planet and Venus.

The similarities of Earth and Venus make the reserach worth wild and valuable. For example, Venus has become very fascinated by Astronomers because of how it is ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" which suggests that the research we gain from Venus could affect how we think about the Earth. Another example is when the author suggests that, ""venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planertary visit"".

The planet is too hot, the pressure is high, and it also has a thick atmosphere that makes it hard to see, but we can overcome that with some ideas and by studying it more.

Venus is like Earth in a lot of ways. It is believed to have had water and life on it before, and it even has physical features like Earth. It also is almost the same size and density as Earth. Scientists want to explore this because it is there first option for space travel. Earth is sometimes closer to Venus than it is to Mars. They want to find out the best way to make it hospitable for people to live there. They have sent unmanned probes there to scout out the territory and to find samples and more evidence that could help them. However, the probes don't last long because of the harsh atmosphere.

There are a couple reasons why it is hard to study. The planet is simply too hot and melts metals easily and quickly. The pressure is higher than our ocean, meaning it can crush us and even a submarine easily. There is also a thick atmosphere made of 97% carbon dioxide that blocks our vision. There are clouds of highly corrosive sulferic acid in the atmosphere too. There are also casual earthquakes, lightining, and volcanoes erupting.

Which makes for a why for how we could study the planet. In the text it states, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"" (Paragraph 5). Even though the tempaturese at this altitude would be still 170 degrees Fahrenheit, the atmosphere pressure would be normal, and we would have solar power. Then we could study the landscape of the planet more and we could learn more about the enviorment. With this knowledge, Venus would be worthy to study even though it have dangerous conditions.

Another way we could study the planet is with new and old tecnology. It says that if we used the computers we use today which are fast and powerful, then we could risk them getting damaged or lost becuase of how delicate they are. NASA has though of another solution to this problem too. Insted of using these comupters, why not use the mehanical computer. In the text it says, ""By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" (Paragraph 7). This way, we could use the computers to find out much more about the planet then just what it looks like too. We could study the mass of the planet, what it is made of, and so on. Which proves that studying venus is worth it.

Even with some of these things support his idea of studying the planet, he does take away from his idea. The text states, ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface tempature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun"" (Paragraph 3). This take away from the idea that we should study it. This thought makes it seem overwhelming to go and study Venus. They do a nice job recovering by using NASA's idea of a ""blimp-like structure"" to take care of some of the heat issue. He also supports his idea by clearly stating that this would make the planet easy to study.

Venus, the Roman God of love, may not seem so kind on the looks of the planet, but with the new ideas scientists are coming up with and the testing that NASA is doing, the idea of a closer study of Venus might not be so far after all. Even though we've been presented with the struggles of the planets hostile enviorment, we as humans have been intrigued with the planet and won't stop untill we know the planet. We have the ideas of how to study it and why we should, we just need to do it. These, as stated from the author, are the reasons we should should study Venus.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8

The author uses the evidence that Venus is the most Earth-like planet because Venus has some features close to Earth. The reasoning is that, from paragraph four, Venus has a rocky surface that has features like valleys, mountains, and craters. This is great evidence because it helps prove the point that Venus was a planet like Earth and that connects back to the claim that Venus is worth studying.

The author uses the evidence that NASA has an idea to send humans to Venus because NASA has a project that will allow scientists to float above Venus. The author's reasoning is that, in paragraph five, NASA came up with the idea of a vehicle hovering over Venus and it will allow the scientists to avoid the unfriendly ground conditions.

""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.""

This quote is important because there most likely would have been ways Venus could sustain some sort of life. If Venus really had oceans and ways of supporting life we can study Venus and maybe find out what happened to it to prevent it from happening to Earth. If we find a way to get to another planet and study it why wouldn't we?

In the third paragraph of the article it explains the harsh environment of Venus which should all be taken into consideration when thinking about Exploring Venus, and in five and seven it explains possible ways to safely explore and study Venus. Paragraph six explains how we cannot simply just orbit around Venus to study it because the gas and chaotic nature of the planet it too thick for cameras and any video to be taken so we would have to go to the surface and to do so we can use mechanical computers which can survive the harsh environment since it doesn't rely on electronics.

In conclusion Venus is the only planet in our solar system that is almost identical to us it could have had the ability to sustain life many years ago but now it's environment is extremely dangerous and any kind of research would be hard to do. There is a new idea to get to the surface of venus for more than a few hours and that is mechanical technology because of it's mechanical nature it can last longer than electronics on the surface which would give researchers a chance to study venus.

The author has some great points actually on why we should go to Venus even though it may be dangerous. He has a lot of information from NASA to his own opinions on why we should send people to explore Venus. Like in paragraph 5 he explains an idea that NASA haves about sending people to Venus on a blimp like vehicle. There is a lot of pros and cons to that idea but he did explain well how it would work but then again he explains how it wouldn't work because they'll be to high up hovering they wouldn't be able to take pictures nor take samples of rocks,gas , or anything which quicly dumped that idea to the trash. The author quickly jumps to more information that NASA has released telling us that they are working on better innovations that would allow machines to last long enough in Venus. That could possibly work since NASA has had people go to the moon already if they work hard they would be able to create a machine that is able to go to Venus. He also explains how Venus is too hot to take phones and cameras and liquify metals but NASA is also working on a way to take mechanical computers, he explains a a lot in paragraph and has very good ideas and point on why we should go which makes me thing we should but we still need even more advancements. I know that soon NASA will have a machine that can go to Venus because we have already has people on the moon and had a machine that sadly died this year(2019) on mars, Venus is next and we will make it to Venus one day, maybe not scientist first but at least a machine that will be able to gather samples to Earth that we will study so one day humas can go to Venus and I believe this because the author explained very well how and why we should go.

""Researchers cannot take smaples of rocks, gas or anything else, from a distance."" This however supports authors claim that ""studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.""

D9CE9FD5A247,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author makes sure the reader knows how much of a 'challenge' a trip to Venus could be. Despite this challege, the auther suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit and may soon be in our future.

Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the sky and the second closest planet to the sun. Venus is nickmaed the ""Evening Star"" becasue of its incredible light that even ""an amateur stargazer"" could easily spot. Venus is a mezmerizing planet that witholds many adventures, many that NASA has tried to complete but failed.

Venus is often reffered to as Earth's ""twin"" as it is the most similar to

Earth in terms of density and size. Not to mention that because of its speed, sometimes Venus is the closest planet to Earth. Because of Venus' 'close-ness', there have been many missions and spacecrafts sent to Venus in order to try to explore the planet despite the dangers. Every mission to Venus has been unmanned because of Venus's reputation of being inhospitable.

Venus has many extreme conditions that make it very challenging to explore. A fraction of these challenges include a ""thick 97 percent carbon dioxide blanket that makes up Venus' atmosphere, clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, over 800 degree heat, an atmopheric pressure 90 times greater that what humans are used to on Earth, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning storms.""

All of these challenges would make anyone run away from ever trying to explore Venus, but the author mentions thst making this exploratory trip to Venus would provide incredible insight into what our ""twin"" planet has to offer.

Many scientists and astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may have once been ""the most Earth-like planet in the Solar System"". Venus was most likely covered in oceans that very well could have supported many forms of life. In addition to this, some of Venus' features vastly remain analogous to those of Earths. These features include ""a surface of rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters.""

The author suggest that Venus would be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, and they are not alone. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been experimenting with how they could possibly send humans to go and study Venus. One of NASA's solutions for surviving the dangerous, hostile conditions is allowing scientists to float approximatly 30 miles over Venus' landscape.

This is not a 100 percent reliable solution as the temperature would still be a roaring 170 degrees Fahrenheit. On the other hand, being 30 miles above Venus would offer a much better air pressure close to that of sea level on Earth. Though it seems impossible, a trip to Venus very well may be in our future as these conditions are indeed survivable for humans.

NASA's other possible approaches include simplified electronics. These simplified electronics are made of silicon carbide and have been repeatedly tested in chambers that simulate Venus' chaotic conditions on its surface.

Another possible solution takes a trip down memory lane with old technologoy called mechanical computers. These mechanical computers were first envisioned in the 1800s and were key during the 1940s in World War ll. The mechanical computer makes calculations by using gears and levers and do not require any form of electronics like the modern day computer.

These devices would allow high exposure to Venus' harsh conditions without having to risk the equiptment or lives needed to get the kind of information that would be very valuable. Mordern technology would not survive a trip to Venus like these new-old machines can. Modern computers are extreme in cases of power, flexibility, speed, and looks, but would never dream to see a day on Venus. Modern technology tends to be more delicate while ""systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.""

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" prove these dangerous challenges are nothing against the value of the worthy pursuit to Venus. If NASA were to send a successful mission to Venus, we would gain an abundence of insight from the planet and the journey to get to Venus. Not to mention the wonders of human curiosity that lead us into making many more equally intimidating adventures into space travel.

The author explains that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" If humans are able to persevere through the many challenges of a mission to Venus, the dangers would hardly compare to the knowledge and experience gained from such an adventure.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8

This sentence in paragraph 2 already shows signs of uncertainty in the author's claim. Although the author mentions that Venus may instill curiosity in humans, the dangers and inhospitable conditions that he also mentions contradict the point he is trying to get across.

Throughout the entire passage, the author provides both negative and positive facts about the idea of human exploration of Venus. Although providing negative aspects might be his idea of a counterargument, the bad outweighs the good in this scenario. ""Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"" (paragraph 3). This statement, full of reasons not to explore Venus, provides a contradictory tone and idea. The author even starts the sentence with ""Beyond high pressure and heat"", which demonstrates the fact that he is adding on more negative aspects to a previously mentioned negative aspect.

The uncertain author also mentions that ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective"". This piece of information alone defeats a large purpose of exploration: getting photographic evidence. ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"". This statement also defeats a huge purpose of exploration: getting physical evidence. Without this ability, scientists would have to get very close to the surface despite the risks. One things that the author mentions to support his claim is that the risks should be thought of or seen as challenges. This change from a negative word to a positive helps to support his claim and provide insight to his passionate opinion.

The author mentions more cons than pros, but he seems to stick with his claim and brush off each negative in the last part of the passage, paragraph 8. ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited to dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". This concluding statement shows that the author is urging humans to be fearless and hungry for exploration and innovation. The author also believes that ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"" anyway. Although this claim sounds more like an assumption, he is trying to show that if humans can explore other dangerous areas of Earth and space, then they can also overcome that obstacles that prevent them from doing the same to Venus.

Although the author mentions that Venus may instill curiosity in humans, the dangers and inhospitable conditions that he also mentions contradict the point he is trying to get across. All in all, the author fails to fully support his claim that Venus is a worthy pursuit desipte the dangers it presents. The facts and evidence prove his claim wrong, and he only provides an inspirational conclusion to create a distraction from the reailty of the situation. With the author providing facts like spacecrafts surviving only a few hours and frequent natural disasters on the planet, he tears down his own claim and gives more reasons as to why this exploration cannot work than why it can.",6,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,1.0

EE620353C3D2,"Although traveling outside of the Earth seems very cool, there are many risks that have to be taken into consideration when choosing what adventure may want to be taken next. In this paper, being shared will be opinions on how the author supported his claim, some of the ways the author backed up or tore down his claim, and finally we will share some of his claims. With Venus being a completely new terrian to be looked at, it is diffivult to show how the planet would react to tests that NASA would like to try with sending a space craft onto the surface of Venus.

In this first paragraph, the authors claims are going to be shared with the readers. The author stated some very interseting things when it came to finding new ways to travel up to Venus. The authors views on traveling to Venus were more one sided towards going and risking it to try and make a new ground breaking discovery. The way the author was describing some of the methods of trasnportation that could be possible to the austronauts that could potentially be travleing up there, was very sided towards him wanting to go through with anything that NASA wanted to try. This quote from paragraph 8 states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imadination and innovation."" This quote from his article is that we should not limit what we do, but oh do not forget that the risks are kinda high and your sruvival rates might not be the best. This is an opinion that the author is feeding to us that risking peoples lives to go to Venus, in test missions, is more important than actually trying to find a solution that will work one hundred percent of the time.

In this next paragraph, being discussed will be some of the ways the author either stood up for or tore down his own claims. In paragraph 7, the author states, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such ocnditions."" This quote is stating a back up to his claim that he is making. With NASA working on traveling to Venus in the near future, the technology could also be used by researchers who are trying to allow people to go to Mars and investigate what is going on there. The technology they are talking about in this article might be about Venus, but it is still and option to use it for other projects as well.

However, there are still a few ways that the author tore down his own claims that he was making about the mission its self. In paragrpaph number 6, the author states, ""However, peering at venus from a ship that is orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" This quote is showing that the author had thrown out one of his ideas but then he starts tearing it down because he is stating that it will not give the information that is neccessary for this trip. With the author tearing down one of his own ideas about how to get up to Venus and get information on it, it is a little harder to try and trust some of the options that he is putting out.

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" made many claims about how NASA could get space ships and different things onto Venus to show whats going on there. In this paper, it was stated that the authors views on traveling to Venus were more one sided towards going and risking it to try and make a new ground breaking discovery. The author was able to give pros and cons to all of the options that were as options for equipment that could be used to get the information that is wanted from Venus. In conclusion, the author did a great job on proving his points and views on ways to get to Venus, and how we can do it.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
4133A1D891FC,"Humans are very curious creatures and with that curiosity we have gone on to explore and understand many concepts of life. We've gone on to explore our planet but now its time to exlpore others. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"",the author explains about what challenges lie ahead in trying explore Venus. Even though the author explains the challenges that come with exploing the planet he is able to make comebacks on how to solve these challenges. With this strategy the author does a good jobs supporting the idea that studying and exploring Venus is worth it overall.

In the article the author presents the following problems,

""no spacecraft surivied the landing for more than a few hours, a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, 800 degrees Fareheit, atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting stirkes"" With so many problems that the author has presented, it seems like it isnt even worth going to Venus . But then he starts to provide solutions. To avoid all of the harsh conditions the author explains that NASA would have scientist float above to fray, which just means that scientist would just float above Venus and study it from afar. Along with that there would be a bunch of solar energy and low radiation. So far this only provides a solution to dodging harsh conditions but we still cant get close enough to get a sample of anything. For that to happen we need to send something down into Venus. The solution the author provided is "" NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" They also think that mechanical computers woud work too. Which makes calculations by using gears and levers, they also can be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. Making a robot of this could mean it would have enought time to collect samples from the planet. Now that we have the solutions why should we go through all of the trouble just to study Venus? Well paragaph 4 states ,""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solsr system. Long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" If Venus was once like earth then maybe we could learn about our planet by taking a look at Venus and not only that it can be very close by in terms of traveling. On the last pragrpah the author explains how exploring Venus will help with on gaining insight but also ""lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors""

Overall the author does a good job on convincing the reader that we should explore Venus and that it would be worth it in the end. He is able to provide solutions to the challenges and does a good job explaning how exploring Venus would be beneficial. He is able to convince me and hopefully others that the planet is worth exploring.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

(paragraph 3) Yes, there are a lot of dangers and the human race can be hurt, but what happens when the earth runs out of supllies to support the human race? Where will we ge then?

It is important to explore all of the other options we have when it comes to places for the human race to go when we run out of supplies and options. Yes, Venus has a lot of risk but when it comes to saving the human race I think it's a risk worth taking. There are a couple things that the Earth and Venus have in common. ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" There are postive things about Venus as well. Every option is going to have it's negitives and it's postivies.

Some of our explores think they might have a solution for humans to live on Venus. ""NASA's possible soltins to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp- like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.

( paragraph 5) There are a lot of dangers when is comes to living on Venus but we might have solutions for them. When is comes to the human race and having a plan B, I think this is something to consider.

Yes, there are quite a few risk when it comes to moving the human race to live on Venus. But NASA thinks that they have a way around that. There a couple things that Earth and Venus even have in common when it comes to the geographical aspects of the planets. Yes, living on Venus comes with changes and yes, it would be a big change.

In paragraph seven of this article it says ""... possible solutions on the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus wold allow scientists to float above the fray."", this means that they have come up with some ways to explore and study Venus without falling victum to Venus's harsh conditions and environment.

Also in paragraph seven the author mentions that some simplified electronocs made of siliocn carbin have been tested in a chamber simulating Venus's surface. The device lasted for three weeks in those conditions.

The author also mentions that Earth and Venus are very similar to each other by saying, "" Often referred to as Earth's 'twin', Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" . The author also calls venus ""our sister planet"" in paragraph four.

He also talks about how Venus has some features that are similar to Earth and how it probably could have supported various life forms.

In paragraph four the author aks the question ""Why are scientists even discussing further vists to its surface?"" and he answers this questions by saying that It has simililar structure to Earth.

Yet, the cons are extreme. In paragraph 2 it states "" No space craft survived the landing after a few hours."" The space men are going to have to learn new techniques in order to discover and survive.

Venus is the closest planet to us in our solar system, which means we should explore it. At least, that is what the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" believes. However, he does not support this claim very well as he gives only one vague reason to explore it, he names several dangers and obstacles of exploring it, and provides very few actual solutions.

First of all, he does a good job of naming the several dangers and obstacles of exploring Venus such as the extreme atmosphiric pressure. The main problem though, is the temperature wich as the author states, ""average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,"" (Paragraph 3). This poses a problem as most metals and other materials melt at such high temperatures. However, the author fails to give very many solutions to these issues.

The author only provides two solutions to the numerous problems that he previously stated. Those solutions were to stay above the atmosphere where it is not as hot, and to create mechanical computers that were more reinforced. These solutions would be all well and good had he not brought up a problem with the first in which he states ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only little insight on ground conditions"" (Paragraph 6) thus, it is not a true solution to the problem at hand. But maybe there is good reasons to keep trying to come up with new ways to explore Venus.

Sadly, the author only provides one vague reason for which scientists should still try to come up with new ways to explore Venus. This reason of his is,""It may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (Paragraph 4). The problem with this is that it does not go very deep into why it being similar to Earth matters. A scientist at NASA might understand any signifigance in that statement, but an average person might not. For that reason it is a very weak argument.

In short, The author does not support his idea for exploring Venus very well because he only gives one vague reason to explore it and he names several dangers and obstacles of exploring it while providing very few actual solutions. Had he named more solutions and reasons to explore Venus it would have supported his idea far more. He named too many dangers without ways to properly combat them, which is why the author's support for his claim was weak.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
5F209EC4FAFE,"Venus is a planet that is a sister to our planet earth and it looked like earth millions of years ago. Venus was way diffrent apart from earth because the Venus from today is hot and volcanic.

Venus is a really intersting planet that hold a lot of valuable information that scientists want to pull from the planet like how its volcanes formed and why the pressure is soo intense. Venus also has such dangerous storms and is hot at 800 degrees to the surface that made spacecraft's metals melt when they were launched from earth to Venus.

Sceintists are trying to find ways that it could be possible for Humans to to close enough to Venus. NASA is also trying to find a way to battle these harsh conditions in Venus but right now as close as they can get is above the fray in Venus but trying to look at to the ground is gonna be difficult since there are clouds blocking the view. NASA is trying to approach on new ideas so that they can land spacecraft machines to land on Venus to last up to 3 weeks while dealing with the temperature and the extreme pressure, they can collect data and send it back to NASA so they can study how the surface is made and how to find a way to battle the enviorment.

I believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite of the dangers because if we manage to study the entire system of Venus we can learn how to make Robots that can withstand harsh conditions and extreme pressure and we can also take more precautions when learing how to overcome these climates. Humans will become more smarter and it will also be just a matter of time before we can start sending spacecrafts to planet Neptune and also start colonizing mars.

Venus is called the Evening Star due to the fact that it is very bright when seen. Venus is the second planet in our solar system and it is almost as bright like the sun, when a stargazer looks up to the sky they can see our planet venus because it is easy to spot for a couple reasons. One beinging it is bright and the second it is close to our moon. The Moon and Venus can be considered twins, they are close in size, and it is close to our Earth but it is also close to the Moon. Venus is a warm planet not nearly as hot as the Sun but somewhere around there, so if huamns were sent up to space to live on Venus they wouldn't survive. There is no water in Venus it is just hot and lots of lava.

Over the years NASA has tried to send spacecraft up to Venus. They haven't been succesful due to the fact that it's so hot on Venus, every spacecraft ever sent has only lasted a couple hours. Not a single human has even been on Venus, they wouldn't want to risk someones life if a spacecraft cant survive than a human wouldn't be able to survive. Venus is truly a difficult planet for humans to study, not a single space ship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Planet venus has 97 percent carbon dioxide, the temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit that is extremely hot, that is 90 times greater than what we experince on Earth. We would think that Mercury would be a hotter planet due to the fact that it is closer to the Sun but it turns out it's not.

Even though Venus is a hard planet to study scientist haven't given up yet. They are willing to do everything that is possible in order to find out more about it, scientist still want to visit the planet. Scientists say that Venus at one point was the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, it probably had Oceans on it, Valleys and even mountains. Scientists are still developing new technology to send humans up into Venus so they can study it and find out more about the planet. They have even thought about designing something that allows astronauts to float on Venus so they dont have to be on Venus, that way they wont get burned.

In Conclusion, more discoveries can be made in order to figure out how we can live on other planets and many more discoveries for Venus can be made. Many things are still being tested in order for us to find out more about our planet. Scientist aren't going to give up until they get some clear shots, there may be some difficulties during the process but it will totally be worth it.

The wind and atmosphere and both something us humans would not be able to handle, even the spacecrafts dont survive. It was stated in the seccond passage, '' since no spacecraft survived the landing is more than a few hours.'' The conditions of this planet are just not living conditions or spacecraft areas.

Stated in the third paragraph that the ''atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.'' ''... the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit'', that is extreamly hot, a human in that hot temperature would fry.

Regaurdless of it, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He states, and i quote '' Striving to meet the challenge presented b Venus has value, not oly because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will liekly lead us into many equality intimidating endavors.'' As the author has implied, scientists would be able to discover so much more, reguardless of what it is aboutl. Even discovering how hot Venus could get, or how risky it could be to continue exploring.

The suface of venus is over 800 degress, that is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. These conditions on Venus are far more extreme. Venus conditions also beat submarines divinging into the deepest parts of out oceans. Ir would liquidfy metals. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar sysem even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian geology and weather presents additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Venus still has some features just like Earth. The planet has rocky sediment and includes familar features like valleys mountains and craters but, you have to consider given the long time frames of space travel.

Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. A cehicle hpvering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of the way. You would have to be 30 plus miles above the surface. The temperture will still be hot around 170 degrees. The air pressure would be close to sea level on Earth.

D00C9B3FFF63,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author, starts by talking about how Venus is part of our solar system and some facts about the planet. They try to support thier ideas on studying Venus as a worthy pursuit and dangers by first listing the similarities it has with our earth and then transitions toward thier topic. The author explains very well, many times by using examples and facts to support their idea about how Venus is a worthy pursuit in the scinece field, but at the same time they also counter with the many dangers that are eminent.

First, the author describes the dangers with facts and statistics about Venus and the amosphere and how dangerous and harmful it is. Like in paragraph three, they stated ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide"" Which readers know is impossible for humans to survive under. Then they talk about the temperatures which is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The author does a really good job at then comparing the temperature on Venus with the temperature on earth by telling us that is is over 90 times greater than what is experienced on earth. Comparing is an effect way of making readers understand the difference and especially when it shows the numbers written all out. Then, they continue to support thier cause by talking about frequent natural disaster that cause havoc which some already excist on earth. This makes Venus looks so much more harmful and uninhabitable than it already did.

Later in the passage, they transition to the benefits of studying about Venus and it is a somewhat smooth transition since the aurthor has already set up thier claim in paragraph two by stating plenty of similarities between the earth and Venus so readers can get and understanding of Venus. So in paragraph four, when the author entered, it was very smooth with a question on why the scientists even bothered and they countered by answering the question which helped support the authors overall claim. Another thing that shows how well the author has supported the idea of Venus worth studying is they list more similarities like in paragraph four they talk about how Venus had similar features like ""valleys, mountains, and craters."" This gave readers a sense of imagery and later supports the imagery and landscape by giving a reason of why that is important like it is out nearest option for travel. This make the author sound much more credible.

Finally, in the article, the author supports both of thier ideas by talking about NASA and thier ideas on the space travel. Paragraph five and six help explain why traveling to Venus is so hard, but still so worthwhile. They state, that it is diffcult by listing the extreme conditions even if they were to get close and still survive. Then in paragraph six they list the risks and the sample and different pictures they could have taken but the dangers were too high. This helps show readers the real limit and possiblity at the same time.

Therfore, the author throughly explains thier idea and supported it very well with different techniques and different ways of explanation. The author has already done very well in adressing how traveling to Venus had its advantages but getting there and actually surviving the dangers is very hard. They did very well in explaining the dangers with facts and statistics. Then later also explained throughly with claims and backup information. This shows that this author was very prepared and supported thier idea exquisitely. ",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
F11C0DCB69A5,"Giving details and information, I think the author explained well the dangers of Venus. He explained the temperatures and how hot it can get there, how it can melt metal things and that it's just not worth living there. But it is worth exploring as in studying it, the rocks and maybe they can find something that could possibly live there. The author supports the idea of studying by saying in paragraph 8 how ""Venus has value"" and how ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limilted by dangers and doubts but she be expanded to meet the very edges or imagination and innovation.

The author says that it gets over 800 F in Venus, says that it could've been possibly like Earth years ago, where humans can live in. But NASA has to do more studying on rocks and other sediments and onjects on Venus. The author explaines how much carbon dioxide is covering Venus, and I believe carbon dioxide is so good for a planet. The planet isn't very useful to live in since it crushes metalic things, and for example cars, something we need to get around places.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2

Other dangerous conditions are such as the temperatures that ""average 800 degrees Fahrenheit.""

The author suggets that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. It is a worthy pursuit because researchers can explore new types of rocks, gas, and etc. Because Venus is such as harsh planet, it makes everything on the planet that much rare. Despite the conditions, when things on the planet are discovered it can make a huge impact on the history of space and scientists.

C0D5253919F3,"Venus is one of the brightest stars in the solar system and is consitered to be the ""second sun"". It is almost as dense as earth and is said to be called ""earths twin"". The planet has been studied very closely even though we are miles and miles away. The planet is almost impossible to land on. Every spaceship that has landed has crashed or dissapeared. The atmosphere is so dense taking a regular iphone there would melt entering each layer of the atmophere.

The most challenging point to venus is it's atmospheric pressure which is ninety times greater then earth and has the ground tempurature eight hundred degrees fairenheit. Scientists have seeen many volcanos and lightning outbursts very close in intrevals of time on Venus which can make landing and space travel difficult. NASA says orbiting, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" Which means the ground would ""liquify metal"".

Since Venus is one of the closest planets we could possibly travel too. NASA has been experimenting and planning. NASA has been planning to bring back the mechanical computer from World War Two, to bring into space because of its dense steel and metals. Some may contemplate Venus is just a rock planet and empty. Scientist have discovered that Venus has has earth's features like, ""rocks, craters, valleys, and mountains"".

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author is talking about how even though Venus is very dangerous, it would still be wise to go out and see if one could discover anthing. Although he provides many reasons not to go out he lacks many reasons that support his idea to send a anything to Venus.

In the begging of this article the author gives many reasons why Venus is a dangerous place. In the article he describes Venus as a place that seems close to a pit of fire stating ""temperatures avrage over 800 degrees Farenheit..., Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus 3). These factors make it impossiable to explore Venus at all and earth technologly would take awhile to be able to make anything that withstand these heats for too long. To try and make a rover that could run around Venus could takes million or billions of dollars and is not worth that much. It also says that ""no spacecraft surived the landing for more than a few hours""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 2). Even if NASA could get another robot to Venus the data collected in just a few hours does prove to be very useful, other than a few pictures showing the likeness of Venus to Earth. The author lacks sustainable sloutions to these problems and provieds more reasions not to go rather than to go.

Next he provies a slotuion to these problems but does not have ones that are exceptionally good. The author says that the likness of Venus to Earth is something that is amazing with ""a surface of rocky sedimant and familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus 4). Although these are interesting they provide little evidence of prevous life and very few reasons to go to Venus. Just because it has hills is no reason to send expensive equiptment or risk lives to go there. He does however give a sloution and safe way to travel to Venus but it has big flaws. He says ""imagine a blimp-like vechile hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venus"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus 5). While this seems like a fantastic idea there are not only many safety issues but also many other issues with this. It has a big flaw of ""only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus 4). If the whole point of the mission is to look at the surface of th eplanet then why send a spacecraft that cannot do that. It may seem like a good short tearm idea it is not usesul in the long run and does not give good enough reason to explore Venus.

In summary the author does not have enough evidence to support his idea of going to Venus. While he tries to provide sloutions non of them work for a long trip on the surface. It may be awhile before a human can go to Venus but in the mean time humans will continue to move forward and push humans to the edge of space.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
7FDBD142597C,"From man's very first trip out of Earth's atmosphere to the iconic moon landing, people from all across the world have always wondered what lies in the unknown solar system that surrounds them. Despite the danger and the failures that plagued these early scientists, they still strived to explore space and the planets within it. In writing ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author is able to very convincingly explain the benefits of exploring Venus, despite the dangerous challenges this endeavour may present.

The article starts off by describing Venus and providing background for the reader, allowing the writer to make a stronger and more understandable claim later on in the work. Venus, as described in the article, is often the closest planet to Earth, depending on the time, and is repeatingly called ""Earth's 'twin'"" because of its similarity in size and density to Earth. The author then goes one to describe the multiple missions already taken to Venus, which have all failed in the end.

While the author does state reasons why a mission to Venus could be treacherous, he or she is able to negate these downfalls by listing all the possible benefits of exploring this inhospitable planet. Venus is considered by scientists to be a dangerous planet to explore for many reasons included in the writing.

For one, its temperature far exceeds in heat any which the Earth has reached by hundreds of degrees. The atmoshpere of Venus also contains a corrosive acid which would be a great obstacle to any vehicle attempting to pass through. The author then goes on to give multiple other reasons in support of danger, but is finally able to oppose these concerns by listing all of the reasons why man kind should explore Venus. For one, Venus is the planet that is most near Earth and therefore will take the shortest time to journey towards. Space travel, the author includes, is very time consuming and not to be taken on lightly. In addition, scientists believe Venus may have once been exceedingly similar to today's Earth. By giving this information, the author is able to infer that information gained by a trip to Venus could be very much crucial to ensuring the survival of the planet home to a large amount of life. The writing claims, after all of these reasons, that ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable,"" despite the hardships explorers would face.

In further support of this claim, the author explains the multiple ways that scientists are testing in order to make a trip to Venus possible. The article shows that already, mutiple ideas have been proven to work.

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is able to very sucessfully make the claim that Venus is worth exploring through negation of the dangers of such a trip by providing multiple benefits of a visit and the ways in which scientists have already found to make the trip possible. Exploration is exceedingly valuable to maintaining and improving life on Earth and, as written by the author, ""should not be limited by dangers and doubts.""   ",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
F113E3F0B0BA,"The author states that Venus may have been like Earth at one point. Venus may have evidence on the surface about what could have happened to cause it to be inhospitable. Also at some point humans are probably going to run into other challenges like Venus. These claims are some of the reasons the author thinks Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

According to some scientists Venus may have been like Earth at one point. If it really was like Earth before there could be much to learn about it. We could find out what the atmosphere was like before it got too extreme. There may be evidence of life that was once on the planet. In paragraph two the suthor states ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size¨ This is a reason many people believe Venus could have been even more of a twin to Earth than it is now.

On the surface there could be the evidence we need to know if there was life forms on Venus. In paragraph five it is said ¨The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.¨ This statement makes it seem that Venus really was like Earth at one point and may have proof if we could land long something on Venus long enough to study the land.

In the future humans will continue to explore the solar system and will very likely run into a planet like Venus again. So if humans can learn how to study planets like Venus or land on them then they would have the knowledge needed for the next planet. If we have experince with planets with extreme conditions before finding another planet that also has extreme conditons we could get more information from the plant and at a lot faster rate.

In conclusion, the author makes multiple points that support their idea of wanting Venus to be studied. Venus possibly being like Earth at one point and giving us experince of planets like that are very important to the author.    ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

The author, talks about how so many projects have been sent to venus and so many have failed to comeback to Earth and also mentions that there are so many factors that contribute to Venus as a challenging planet for humans to study there obviously has to be a reason why it is such a difficult planet to study.

The author, mentions so many reasons why venus has many dangers that contribute to it and did a good job on telling why it is such a dangerous planet as he mentions Venus is one of the brightest points in the sky, The tempertures average over 800 degress in Fahrenheite, or that Venus has 90 times greater atomic pressure then earth does. Also makes a point that Venus is a very dangerous planet and is trying to tell us that their must be a reason why Venus is so dangerous and thats why he makes a great observation on why Venus is a worthy pursuit.

The author mainly supports his idea with the fact that Venus may have been like Earth a long time ago, but it is not really necessary to learn about Venus.

In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" the author supports his idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by comparing it to Earth and how it has many Earth-like features, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" paragraph 4. And even though this may have been true this is not nessacary. If we do somehow figure out a way to study Venus, what would we do with that information, it's just useless information.

If human cannot inhabit Venus what would be the purpose of spending a lot of money in order to obtain information for our curiosity.

In the article the author spends more time talking about how we would be able to explore Venus than why we should explore Venus. Out of 8 paragraphs the author gives us 2 paragraphs on why we should explore Venus, in paragrpah 2 he tells us that it is one of the closest planets to us. In paragraph 4 he tells us that astronomers are curious about Venus because it is so alike to Earth. Then in paragraphs 5, 6, and 7 he talks about NASA how they will go about exploring Venus, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape."" instead of just giving us more than 2 reasons on why we should spend our money and time to do something pointless.

The author did not support his ideas well. In the article he wrote more on how we would get to explore Venus rather than giving us more than two reasons on why we should explore Venus.

Despite these dangers that he presented such as a very high tempature, exploring more into Venus is very important.

The author has done really well in supporting this claim because he/she explained where Venus is, said why venus could be very challening to explore, and what NASA can try to do to complete the challenging exploration of venus.

My first reason of my the author has done on this claim is that he/she explained where Venus is located in space. according to the passage Venus is the second planet from the sun. Also it is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and the closest in distance. It is said that both Venus and Mars are Earth's planetary neighbors. Earth, Venus, and Mars all orbit the sun in different speeds.

My second reason is why Venus could be very challenging to explore. It might not be a good idea for humans to got to Venus because it could be really hostile for people. NASA might have a possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. In other words its not proven to be safe around Venus yet but through time NASA will firgure out a way for sure if Venus is safe for us nor not.

They are trying to find a way to make our vehicles to last longer to get more information on Venus. They are also working on other approches to studying Venus.

The temperature gets really hot on Venus. In the text it states "" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.""

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggest that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because Venus is so close to earth and share similar traits with each other, the author wants this challenge to be conquered, and for the experience to be a learning insight.

First, the author states that Venus is referred to as Earth's ""twin"" because of their close proximity, density and size. This is a way that the author supports the idea because it should be a way that humans can reach this planet and study it. Also, because Venus is thought to be the most Earth like planet in the solar system. Ideas should be created in order to reach the limits of Venus.

Then, the author supports the idea with the statistic of how spaceships has not been able to touch Venus in more than three decades. As said in the article, ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?""(paragraph 4) If the challenge can be conquered of landing on Venus safely, Astronomers can gather so much insight that could also lead to other big things being conquered.

Lastly, the author supports the idea with the knowledge that can be gained from the experience. There has already been an idea of how humans will get to Venus, "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.""(paragraph 5). With all the compelling ideas just to get to Venus is inspiring, like bringing back mechanical computers from World War II to gather the samples off of the surface to test. The pursuit of getting to Venus is full of new innovations, old improved innovations, and imagination.

In conclusion, the author's idea is very well supported with statistics and ambition. One day someone will make it to Venus and the results will hopefully be insightful and rewarding. Beyond what is on Earth should not be given up on or intimidating, instead it should be charged with great intentions.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
0CB40DD64679,"Venus is a marvelous planet. The Evening Star is very dangerous however, the planet is inhabited by a high amount of sulfiric acid. In the article, it supports the idea that studyig Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by being Earth's twin, supporting the idea that there was once live inhabitants, and that humans don't really know what is on Venus.

There are many planets in our galaxy however Venus seems to proportionally the same as planet Earth. According to ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"" (paragraph 2). This quote exemplifies that Venus is very similar to Earth relating to size. Venus is very dangerous however, that does not stop human beings from wanting to explore the planet. Scientists are also interested in Venus from the close resemblance of Earth. According to the article, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (paragraph 4). On Venus, there is evidence of rocky sediments as well as features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. This suggests that Venus was once a planet just like Earth until something happened to destroy the chances of being able to inhabit that area.

With Venus being a ""sister planet"", that brings the question of was there actual life on Venus? As stated in the article, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life..."" (paragraph 4). This quote essentially states that the ""Evening Star"" holds many forms of evidence that suggests Venus could have inhabited many forms of living species. As well as theorizing, there is actually concrete evidence that life may have inhabited the planet. The article states that, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment ad includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (paragraph 4). The quote shows the concrete evidence that is needed to say that humans or other species of living creatures could have inhabited the planet at a point in time.

Despite the dangers on Venus, the planet has sparked some curiosity. As stated in the article, ""...peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions..."" (paragraph 6). Venus has very dangerous features of ""protection"" all throughout the planet. This prohibits, at this point in time, for humans or land rovers to go to the surface of Venus. Although it being a severe risk of getting a closer look, NASA has been developing several tactics to get closer to the surface. In the article it states that, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Vens would allow scientist to float above the fray"" (paragraph 5). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been working on better ways to get closer to the surface of Venus without the metal melting.

In conclusion, Venus that has been a place that has a curiosity of discovery for many years. In the article, it supports that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by being Earth's twin, supporting the idea there was once live inhabitants, and that humas don't really know what is on Venus.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
9FC63A1DE240,"The reason why the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is because of how interesting it is to examin when you are close to the planet itself. Essentially when thinking of traveling from and beyond, we should not be limited by dangers or even the doubts of such exploration, buy we should expand and exceed to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation that comes from exploring such subtances in space. The true reason for us to examine Venus is for the innovation and progress in science that comes from it and how Venus is the closet planet to have identical features as earth.

Even if our sister planets are out of the question for examination due to dangerous conditions, astronomers are fascinated by Venus since it has the potential to be the most Earth-like planet in our entire solar system. The text states that, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This quote indicates that Venus has similar features to what Earth has; therefore, Venus is the nearest option when looking at planets that are similar to Earth and also the consideration that we have a pretty long time frame for space travel. There aren't many options for a safe and scientifically mission, so this is our best option for porductive wise for us in the space enviroment of exploring. This is one solid reason for the author to say that the trip to Venus would be a worthy pursuit, but would have dangers to it, but we will be able to expand our innovation in the science world.

NASA has a plan to allow scientist to go to Venus with a blimp-like vechile which whould hover 30 feet above the Venusian landscape letting them examine the features of Venus. The quote provides, ""At thirthy-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" The quote indicates that the scientists may feel toasty with that 170 degrees of Fahrenheit on them, but the pressure that is psuhed on the would be the equivalent of the sea level which is on Earth. Overall, these are not the easiest conditions, but it is survivable for humanss to live and stay productive in the task at hand. This is another solid reason for the scientist to travel to Venus and to expand there knowledge and space innovation as well, even with hazardous conditions that are presented during there examination.

By having the will and courage to travel and observe the features of this planet, which has the potential to be similar to the planet that we live on, Earth, we are able to expand our thoughts and innovation of space and able to progress in our space knowledge as a whole. Even though there will be dangers that are presented during the journey, you will be protected by science itself, with its blimps from NASA or the will for observation in comparing Earth and Venus's features. Overall, it is a worthy pursuit to examine and observe the potential to be the identical planet to Earth from its features.             ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
3E7CF0FBAF5C,"Studying venus would be really interesting but venus is hard to study because it´s dangerous and it has really high pressure.

Venus is sometimes known as earth´s twin because venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size. Scientist have tried to get to get numerous spacecrafts on venus but no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Venus is one of the hardest planet to study and research. It´s hard for astrounauts to go to venus because temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what humans experience on our own planet.

If NASA sent humans to venus it would be really hard for the astronauts to land because it has hostile conditions on the surface of venus. When the humans would land on venus the air pressure would be close to some of the levels in the sea and the temperature would be toasty.

In conclusion, venus has challenging things it presents and it would make it very hard for people in NASA to put human life on a planet that has very high air pressure and temperature that we are not used having on earth. ",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
161DEDCDD17D,"There are many benefits and downsides to go to venus.

Just like the tittle say of this article. "" The challenge of exporling venus. It is not going to be easy trying to study life on venus and actually trying to live there. For example in the text it states that "" No spacecraft surived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this isue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on venus in more than three decades. Which means that no one has been on venus in a very long time. More evidence of how we can't live on venus is. ow there are clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venu's atmosphere. If you don't know what corrosive sulfuric acid is or what it does let me tell you, you do not want that. If that touches your skin it will literally melt your skin off and it will burn like nothing before.

Despite all of the negative things on venus;there are some benfeits that humans can get from being on venus. For example, in the text it says that. "" Venus was probably coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Also, the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar eatures such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Another piece of evidence from the text says that venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.

Some more textual facts from the article says that

"" Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. The text says "" Amagine a blip- like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. Just as or het airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. Now that would be amazing for our scientist to do. Another thing that would be a benfit from being on venus would be solar power. We would pretty much never run out of sunlight and we could run off of solar pannels for a long time.

In Conclusion, all of the dangerous conditions on venus, there are some good things to come out of it.

You should never just be biased and look on one side, you should always look on the other side as well and see if there can be any benefit or any good that could come out of it. And becuase we are looking on the other side despite of the bad stuff maybe one day we could possibly live on venus.                                 ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is very for the exploration of Venus. Venus is a planet in our solar system. It is sometimes called the evening star because it is one of the brightest points in the night sky or it is called Earth's twin due to similarity in density and size. We also dont know much about Venus because it is very dangerous due to very hot temperatures and many other things. But exploring it would be very worth it. Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents beacause human curiosity will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors, we could get more insight about Venus, and our travels on Earth, and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts.

One reason that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is beacuse human curiousity will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Who knows, human curiousity and advancing in technology could lead us to any other planet in our solar system. The more we know about life the more we can explore. In the story it says, "" These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus."" If we explore Venus we can most definitely explore Mars as well.

Another reason that studying Venus is worthy is beacuse we can get more insight about Venus. We need more information about Venus because it is Earth's sister planet. The more we understand Venus the easier it will be to understand space. In the text it says, "" If our sister planet is so inhospititable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface"" This could possibly mean we could live on Venus someday. That would be a major benefit if anything ever happened to Earth.

The third reson that studying Venus is worthy despite the dangers is because our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubt. If we don't explore there is no explanations to peoples questions. Everyday we risk our lives because we never know what can happen. We shouldn't limit our decisions and our exploration based on fear. In the text it says "" just as ariplanes travel at a high altitude"" which means that it wouldnt be anything super unsafe to hover above Venus so why not try and do it.

In conclusion, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

If we explored it human curiousity will lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors, we could learn more about venus, and our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by our dangers and doubts. Venus is a planet that is very close and similar to Earth why should we not explore it?

2F5792CF7382,"scientist wanna learn more about the planet venus to see how it is and if it really is the closest planet to earth there is in this solar system.

The planet Venus is a difficult planet to search because earth has sent multiple missions for it unmanned because no spacecraft survied the landing more than a few hours. A spaceship has not touched down into Venus in more than three decades. The reason why its hard is because venus atmosphere is very thick, its 97% carbon dioxide. Also the clouds of venus have sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere. The average temperature in venus is usually 800 degrees Fahrenheit. the pressure of the atmosphere is 90 times greater than what we have in our own planet, that type of pressure could crush anything.

the reason they wanna know more about venus is because astronomers wanna learn more about the planet. the reason they are so curious is because its the closest earth like planet in our solar system. They say that long ago venus had an ocean and could have had various forms of life in it. the way astronomers wanna learn more about it is by using a blimp like vehicle that hovers around 30 miles floating above the venus landscape.

E1E0317FEA28,"Venus is worthy of continual human study. The author makes this statement very clear. Despite the clear dangers of human exploration on Venus, scientists feel there is much to learn about this possibly once inhabited world. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" (4). Venus contains many features unilike the Earth, but scientists claim ""it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (4). Studying Venus would be an extreme opportunity for the scientists around the world to develop new technology and gain knowledge about ""our sister planet"" (4).

With Venus's ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide"" (3) it is an extremely inhospitable planet. The planet has an insane surface temperature of 800 degrees, making it impossible for humans to land a space craft and gather data. Since this surface temperature is hot enough to liquefy metals scientists have had to adapt their thinking of how to innovate a creating that could withstand this heat. NASA has imagined a ""blimp-like vehicle [that could hover] 30 or so miles above"" (5) Venus. Scientists at NASA have been brainstorming innovative approaches to making Venus exploration possible, like a silicon carbide, mentioined in paragraph 7, that has been tested in a chamber similar to the conditions on Venus's surface. They have also been comparing technology from decades ago called ""mechanical computors"" (7). The brillant technology used today is fast, but has become more delicate, whereas back in the 1940's ""these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all"" (7), making them perfect for Venus exploration beucase of their higher resistance to pressure and heat. An energy sorce on that planet is already provided as ""solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Eath levels"" (5). These challenges of the dream of one day taking man to travel to Venus is keeping human curiosity working to create the inventions needed.

In order to learn about Venus the space workers need samples from the planet. With the idea of a hover craft to simply fly around Venus 30 miles above the surface we cannot gather samples of rock or terrrain and ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective"" (6). This means there would be no reason to travel the to dangerous Venus if they could not bring any knowledge back to Earth. The more scientists understand that to bring valuable knowledge back to Earth, they need to overcome the callenges and risks of this mission ""to contribute meaningfully to our knowlege of Venus"" (6).

The author of this article does well in presenting the knowledge needed to claim the value of a dangerous mission to Venus. Of all the evidence proving the meaningfullness of information about this planet, that used to be not unlike Earth, human curiosity and the yearn for exploration of the unknown is more compelling. It gives scienists at NASA a ryhme and reason to create machines that can withstand hundreds of degrees of heat and obstacles to overcome to bring home samples of a planet ""dense and [sized]"" (2) like Earth. ""While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely"" (1). Exploreres and innovators must find a way to get up close and personal with a planet that has been out of reach of our spaceships for three decades. The author ties this entire article together by claiming, ""our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8). The adventures humans go on should be determined by the great minds working to invent machines to over come the seemingly impossible. A mission to Venus for humans to study is beneficial to scientist who will stretch the laws of nature to invent new technology that could be used in the future for more than this mission to Venus and people around the world will be able to know valuable information about ""our sister planet"" (4) Venus.

The author throughout the text keeps the readers attention by giving physical attributes about Venus and explaining how NASA is involved in finding a way for humans to survive at least 30 miles above the surface.

In this text the author covers many different facts about venus itself and how we can explore it. For example in paragraph 3 the author starts by giving us specific details to get a picture of venus in our head. The author did this by making the statement that, ""Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide that blankets it. The author also compares Venus to other things we might know like the ""evening star,"" or earths ""twin."" This helps the reader undertand that the author really wants to make a point that Venus isn't uncommon to most people. Jumping back to paragraph 4, the author tells us about Vesus's features and possibly its past features. They explained that Venus at one time probably was capable of supporting life because of signs of oceans and features still there like mountains, valleys and craters.

In conclusion the author in my opinion did a very good job supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

Venus is the most unexplored planet in the solar system, less than the Earth's oceans.

Venus could give us reason to develop new technology to last longer on its surface: ""Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks."" We human beings tested silicon carbide electronics in a chamber simulating Venus's surface and it lasted three weeks before it was finally broken down by the chaotic conditions.

BF76F7BE36CF,"In the article ""The challenge of exploring Venus."" The author talks about some of the ideas why venus is worthy to explore and reason why not to explore it. Today I am here to tell you both sides of the story and how they are both effective.

In the authors article the reasons why people should go ahead and explore Venus is found in paragraph 2 ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionaly the closest in distance too.""In paragraph 4 he says that ""Astronomers are facinated by venus becasue it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" He then went on to say that ""Venus was probably largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Eath."" Venus may be close to eath it has surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Those are some of the main reasons in the article why the author thinks that venus is worthy of exploration.

Even though Venus is conviently close to Earth and has some features that Earth has there is also some down fall to Venus that is very dangerus. Like in the second paragraph where the author says that ""there has been no spacecraft that has survived more than a few hours"" maybe Venus doesn't seem as perfect as I was making it to be at first. The author also said in the third paragraph that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" One of the most challenging parts about Venus are the clouds that are highly corrosive inVenus's stmosphere or it is the temperatures that average over 800 degrees. The author also says in the third paragraph that ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcannoes, powerful earthquaked, amd frequent lightining strikes seeking to land on its surface. Those are the dangers of Venus and probably why we shoulsn't go down there and explore.

Even though there are some ups and downs of exploring venus I bet that just people being curious and wondering what is over there will lead us to exploring it. In paragraph 8 the author says that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts"" which I agree on if we are really curios what is going on in venus we shoudl go ahead and explore what is going on over there and see if it is nice being there or not.

Knowing we couldn't go there maybe people lose intrest in the planet, but there's a lot more to learn about it. There are some positive things about the planet that you might know or maybe you could learn. Venus is one of the hottest plantes we haveand it could be very dangrous, but it also has some futures just like earth does.

Venus is the second planet from the sun and knowing that it's so close must mean that it really is hot. But also, as i have said it's really simmular to Earth. As is says in the article ""It may have well been the most Earth-like planet."" Also they have said that Venus has some feature that are just like earth ""The planet has a suface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features like valleys, moutains, and craters.""

I agree with the author, studying Venus could be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presests. Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot, and the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. ""Venus, sometimes called the 'Evening Star', is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot""(Paragraph 1).""Often referred to as Earth's 'twin', Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distant""(Paragraph 2). However, I think studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. I have couple reasons why I think studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

First of all, about 97 percent of a thick atmosphere blankets Venus are carbon dioxide. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is working on study about the planet, Venus. If NASA is possible to make spacecraft that could go to land on the surface of Venus, it will be difficult people research on the planet because 97 percent of the atmosphere are carbon dioxide. This condition makes different envionment from Earth.""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus""(Paragraph 3).

Secondly, the average temperatures of Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit""(Paragraph 3). It is not possible that people stay on Venus on this very high temperature.

Finally, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what they experience on Earth.""the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(Paragraph 3). For example, if a person's weight is 70kg, the weight will chage t o 630kg on Venus. It is difficult to work on researching on enus.

In addition, beyond high pressure and hean, Venusian geography and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful eathquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. ""Beyond high pressure and hean, Venusian geography and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful eathquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface""(Paragraph 3).

87097E5CC6CF,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author does a great job at evalutating his idea of Venus and its dangers. No spacecraft has ever survived the landing of Venus for more than a few hours and if that is the case then surely a human could never survive that so it seems.

The carbon dioxide, temperature and pressure is just one of the many dangers of Venus as the author clearly describes. The atmosphere, according to paragraph 3, is about 97% carbon dioxide. On the planets surface, it is also 800 degrees fahrenheit. Just these dangerous factors of Venus makes me believe humans will most likely never step a foot on the planet.

In paragraph four, the author discusses the interest in exploring this planet further despite all of the dangers. Astronomers go on to believe that Venus used to be quite earthlike with lots of oceans and could have possibly supported some sort of life. It includes rocky mountains, valleys, and craters as well. The author states that ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?""

In paragraph five the author describes to us the solutions NASA and other astronomers are trying to come up with to be able to explore planet Venus. They want to try to avoid its terrible conditions on the surface and avoid as much pressure as possible by creating a floating aircraft to hover over Venus. The author states ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" There is conflict however because there would be no way to retrieve any samples of rock or gas from this distance.

Imagine having a twin, but never knowing anything about your twin due to the dangers they posses. Well, Earth and Venus are a great example of that scenario. Earth being the planet us humans live on everyday of our lives, Venus´s aspects are similar to the ones of Earth´s. Keeping this in mind, Venus has a plentiful amount of dangers that lurk the planet, delaying the exploration of our twin planet. So why does the author suggest that we should pursue exploring Venus? The author belives we should pursue exploring Venus due to the possibility of a crucial planetray vist, being scientifically productive, and overall just having more knowledge of the planet itself.

To begin, if Earth were to ever start to decade and there were still human life, would living on a different planet be an option? Astronomers have conducted studies showing that Venus may have once held life there itself. In paragraph 4, the article states; ¨Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rock sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.¨ This example shows that our Earth has similar factors of that which Venus has. Another example to show that us humans may one day be able to colonize Venus,if the occurence were to happen, is the conditions. In paragraph 5, the article reads; ¨Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.¨ Although the statement claims that the conditions are not easy, they are still bareable to the human population. Summing up, Venus could soon be a home to us, and scientest will soon be able to know whether or not that is possible by exploring Venus.

Secondly, the exploration of Venus can provide more scientific facts, proving to be scientifically productive. To do this, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will send humans to collect data. Hostile conditions may play into how we do this, but NASA´s possible solution would allow scientists to exam our sister planet without interfearing with the hazardous conditions. In paragraph 5, the article states; ¨Imagien a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus wpuld avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying out of their way.¨ The idea of this hovercraft is based around the already scientfic facts of the planet Venus, such as the temperature and air pressure the hovercraft would be experincing. In paragraph 5, the article reads; ¨...temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.¨ Consenquently, the hovercraft could provide more benifical scientific evidence of planet Venus for our astronomers and scientists.

Last, but not least, using what we already know about the planet could help NASA and scientists to further explore Venus. Studies conducted to enhance our technology of exploration have shown what Venus could damage. In paragraph 7, the article states; ¨For example, some simlified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus´s surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.¨ This exmaple shows what possible scenarios could produce from the pursuit of exploring Venus. The end results will then contribute to greater advancements of that certain technology to one day be able to withstand that conditions of Vneus. Overall, our previous knowledge combined with new facts and information can assist with how NASA and scientists will explore our sister planet.

Concluding, the author belives we should pursue exploring Venus due to the possibility of a crucial planetray visit, being scientifically productive, and overall just having more knowledge of the planet itself. The conditions and atmosphere may affect how much we are able to learn and explore, but NASA has innovated new developments to help us explore further. Consuming all the information, data, facts, and end results have pushed the determination of exploration. With this all being said, are you ready to learn more about our sister planet Venus?

In the story the author is talking about have Venuse is Earth sister and how Venuse may have had life form on it. Venuse is a posible living place. NASA need to do more resurch on Venuse but it is hard to do when Venuse has only been bored a few times and its hard to see through a scope.

Venuse is known as the ""Evening Stars because it is just a dot in the lends. Besides the sun Venuse is one of the brightest pionts in the sky. The planet Venuse my have once been like our own lively. No this planet that we call our sister is just filled with dusty mountains abd vallies.

NASA is tring to find out more information about Venuse. Why? Because NASA is truying to find a way to give Venuse back life. NASA is not only trying to give Venuse back life, but also to see weather it is living grounds. In order to make sure Venuse is the right planet to give life to NASA has to find out the presure and the oxigen levels.

The author males it very clear that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports his idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger many times in this article for example in the text it says ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one paerticularly compelling idea of sending humans to stufy Venus."" How are we gonna send humans down to a planet we dont know that much. This is just one of the many text eveidnce the author put in the text to show Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author from the very start of reading this article shows that Venus is well worth the time and effort we are putting towards it. In the text it says ""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin"" Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size"". Venus and Earth are alike in many ways for example Earth Venus and mars are our lanetary neighbors they orbit thr sun as different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times closer to Venus because how it says in the text ""Venus is sometime right around the corner in space terms."" This is other example on how well the author supports his idea of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it present.

We have tried many ways to try to learn more about Venus but there are many things getting in our way of learning more about Venus for example in the text is says ""Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this could-draped world"". We are more then exicted to try to learn more about Venus but thats not the only thing stopping us from learning more In the text is says ""However peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limtied insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" As you have read normal taking photos will not be enought just to learn and see how Venus surface is we need to go down and see ourselfs however that will be very hard somce no spaceraft survived the landing for more than a few hours as stated in the text. The author shows why his statment of how Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it present in many ways.

Astronomers are fascinated with Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system a long time ago. If Venus was once like Earth maybe it can be again because our Earth will not last forvever we will need somewhere else to go and maybe that place is Venus. In the text it says ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported varous forms of life just like earth today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet has surface of Rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys mountains and craters."" This text evdience shows why we are interested in learning more about Venus and once again supporting the idea of the author that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it present.

87A6EF3113C6,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", uses many scientific facts, data, and explanations to support their idea of exploring Venus. In the passage, many examples are given of why scientists would want to explore the possibilities of the contents of Venus despite all the dangers. The text gives some support like declaring it the most Earth-like planet, the possibility of supporting life forms, and multiple explorations to Venus that have been successful.

Venus' relation to Earth is significant because it is the closest example of another planet like Earth. The author claims that Venus is even called Earth's twin and that not only is it like Earth in its density and size, but also in the distance between the two planets. Even though the planet is very similar to Earth there are challenges to get accurate data on the planet because of the many spacecrafts that were unable to withstand the harshness of the planet. As technology advanced, the author claims that more and more missions to Venus occured, and even around the time of World War II there was a spacecraft that survived in Venus conditions for about three weeks. Venus' conditions are very harmful to the life on Earth but there may have been a possibility that life could sustain on the planet. The author describes Venus as a planet mostly covered in large oceans that could have suppported life growing there. All of these examples that the author has given supports his idea of the need to explore Venus tremedously and gives very convincing evidence and data that supports his idea.

Although Venus is a very harsh planet and there may not be any possibility of life, it would still be worth it to explore this planet and how it works. The author explains in detail what Venus is like and supports his ideas with scientific facts and data. There is a possibility that life could sustain on Venus but that is unknown unless the option is explored.      ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes fimilar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Therefor this is a reason why scientist love to study Venus it just like Earth but without any humans on the planet and it could be an option for a next planet vist.

""Just as our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendy ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. at thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on Earth.

So since Venus is like kind of sutable for humans it could be a new Earth in cse if something happen on Earth like a radioactive wave that could kill anybody we can go to Venus and live there dispite the harsh temepature and landing, it has a lot of similaritys of Earth.

Overall Venus is a good planet for living things to live on and good thing for scientist to study over Venus to get some good and bad and theres obaviously bad side of Venus but scientist and many other researchers are trying there best to make a perfect world incase somethng does hapen in the future and we have to evacuate Earth.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
C5760ECD2686,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests the opinion that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Throughout the article, the author brings up many of those dangers but also many ways to prevent them and all the upsides to visiting the planet. The author supports the idea very well throuhout the article.

The author begins the article by stating all of the dangers of actually having a human visit or land on Venus. The article mentions that no spacecraft has survived more than a few hours because of such harsh conditions. Those harsh conditions begin with the temperature. On Earth it is rare to get much higher than 110 degrees Fahrenheit, but on Venus, the average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahreheit. Venus is closer than Earth to the sun, with an atmosphere made up of about 97 percent carbon dioxide and with clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The author also mentions to worsen the conditions, it is common to have erupting volcanoes, major earth quakes, and big lightning strikes across the planet. To put these conditions into perspective, the author mentions that even Earth's deepest submarines would be crushed when placed on Venus.

After the author mentions all the horrible dangers of studying and visiting Venus, all the good that would come from the trip is brought up. For example, the author mentions that the planet is the most like Earth and it would be incredibly helpful to NASA and the whole world to research Venus and actually send someone to visit the planet. The author also mentions that at certain times, Venus is the closest to Earth which would make for a shorter travel time than visiting another planet. The author also highlights that Venus very well could hvae supported forms of life many years ago.

Lastly, to prove the opinion of the article, the author brings up counter arguments to all of the current dangers many people have about sending someone to Venus. The temperature issue is solved along with the air pressure issue when the author suggests the idea that NASA has to possibly send a blimp-like spacecraft to float around Venus, just 30 miles up and off the surface. The author states that this would reduce te temperature to around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, which is actually phisically possible to live with, and a similar air pressure to the Earth's. Although this blimp idea will provide limited insight, a human could actually survive this trip.

In conclusion, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The article supports this by first giving a list of dangers, then giving reasons to go through with the idea, and lastly presenting a way to fix previous issues. The author knows what he is talking about, addresses each issue strongly and confidently, and supports his idea very successfully.   ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

The author of the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" propposes it is a fantastic idea. The dangers are a small risk to take to gain more information about this planet. The author states all of the following reasons to support his point.

Venus is the most Earth-like planet, this may mean that the planet could support other life forms. It is the closest in size and in some cases distance to Earth. Venus has shown to have earthquakes, erupting volcanoes and lighting. These are all things that happen on earth as well and no other known planet. Venus probably had large bodies of water at some point as well, making it able to support life forms of some sort. The structure of Venus is made up of rock, valleys, mountains and craters. Earth and Venus have multiple simalarities.

There are also many dangers to visiting Venus. The atmosphere is made up of 97 percent carbon dioxide and has great amounts of highky corrosie sulfur acid from clouds. The pressure on Venus is 90 times greater than Earth. A huge danger is the temperature of the planet. Venus can get to over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. All of these things are a hazard to life.

This author is so detail it like his counting 1 piece of a humans hair.

The author gave us so many detail about Venus. Venus planet surface temperature is an average of 800 degrees Fahrenheit, oooh man that hot. Also the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our planet, that a bit dangerouse because it could crush submarine underwater. This one is my favorite because it really intresting. Venus has high pressure and heat and the weather present erupting volcanoes, powerful eathquake, and frequent lightning stikes, I found that out really intresting because we don't that much here we will get them like once in 2 month.

If you wanna learn about Venus, this is where you should start reading. I say that because just by reading this I get the hang of it. Some things I learned are, Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system. Here is something really intresting Mercury is the closest to the sun but still, Venus is way hotter I find that out pretty intresting. We know the sun is really hot, totally if you get really close to it. Also Venus is a challenging planet for humans to study because of the planet's conditions.

The author support his title ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" by giving us detail about how dangerous it is. The author just doesn't say it dangerous or challenging. It giving reasons how it dangerous, like no spacecraft survuded landing more than a few hour. The clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere.

FE67EEE68565,"In ""The Challenge Of Exploring Venus,"" the author uses many details to suggest how venus is important to explore even though the risks are extremely high.

The first example of how the author proves that venus is worth exploring is in paragraph 4 the author states, ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" The author uses this quote from NASA in the article to show how even though they know its extremly risky, people are still trying to find solutions rather than leaving the problem.

The second example is in paragraph 7, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide has been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for 3 weeks in such conditions."" This example shows how the scientists are so curious in Venus that they simulating the harsh conditions to make strong technology to survive on Venus.

The third example is in paragraph 8, the author states ""Striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value, not only because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author uses this example to summaraize that if we take the time and make the technology to explore Venus, then good things could come out of the solutions.

7C464252BE20,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports the idea of exploring Venus despite the dangers because they believe it will (1) help technology advance further, (2) inform on what Venus was once like millions of years ago and (3) satisfy human curiosity.

The author believes that persuing the exploration of Venus will help further our technology. In paragraph 2, the author states, ""...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" The author makes a point of saying that one of the main reasons Venus is so difficult to access is because we do not yet have the technology to withstand conditions there yet. However, if we were to start with a minor mission of searching for breakthroughs in what is currently possible and what can withstand all of the harshness Venus has to offer, then we can put that technology to other use that would be able to break the barriers of what humankind thinks to be impossible. The author sees Venus as a testing ground scientists can use to further develop technology with no real risk involved. Trial and error has no trade off in this situation, we only continue to experiment with what we know and question what could be.

Additionally, the author believes that there is still much data that can be collected from Venus to help human kind understand what the planet was once like. In paragraph 4, the author states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" We are always trying to find other possible forms of life in space. Whether it's through radio wave length communication, satellite image, etc. we're searching for other planets that have the possibility of having other forms of life on them no matter if they're microscopic amoeba or just simply a small river. Science is desperately curious to discover what other planets have to offer in terms of supporting and sustaining human life. Therefore, if this planet was once able to sustain life or quite possibly if it did sustain life, that would be an incredible breakthrough considering how close Venus is to Earth. We could learn how the ecosystem was, when it existed, etc. We could even learn how it came to an end to compare to our panet and possibly save Earth from having a similar fate. The possibilities of the knowledge that could be gathered from Venus is endless and is unmistakeably worth indulging in to see what we can come up with.

Finally, the author gives the idea that Venus shoud be investigated to simply satisfy human curiosity. In paragraph 8, the author states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Although the author does not directly say human curiosity is a main reason we should persue the exploration of Venus, the idea of it is subtley implied several times throughout the article. At the end of reading the article, the reader can't help but feel curious as to what Venus has to offer as well. It's simply the product of clever writing and expression of passion that this author has presented in a well informed manner. The reader wants to know if there was once life on Venus and if science can create the technology needed to withstand such an environment. They want to know, if that breakthrough technology is created, what other possibilities lay ahead for humans to further discover? The author secreted their own energy and enthusiasm for such a topic that can be so bland and uninteresting, and instead conjured up curiosity within the reader's mind, enthralling them and leaving them to ponder the potential.

Thus, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports the idea that the exploration of Venus should be persued despite the dangers because it will (1) push for breakthroughs in technology, (2) provide knowledge on the possibility of life having been sustained on Venus and (3) satisfy human curiosity on what Venus has to offer and what it could mean for the future of humankind.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8

If scientists can build a machine that allows us to get closer to objects on Venus, we could take them back to Earth (paragraph 7). If we could do this, it would help us gain more knowledge on the atmosphere and ground conditions of the planet and help scientists learn how to get humans closer to possibly getting to Venus one day. Human curiosity will likely lure us into many equally intimidating endeavors. For example, in the text it even talks about how far we have come with computers. Knowing this, we should take advantage of our curiosity. imagination, and innovation. This would allow all people to have a better insight of Earth's twin planet, Venus.

In conclusion, scientists have come a long way from the very beginning. Astronomers are inventing marvelous machines that last up to 3 weeks even in horrific weather condition simulators. Astronomers are looking at things in a whole new perspective and will one day make it to Venus. Although it's quite dangerous, the work will be a worthy persuit in the end.

ECAEEA2C3C9A,"Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth and is also reffered to as our sister planet. We have sent many probes to Venus, yet many have not survived more than a few hours. Venus may be very close to us compared to other planets in our solar syestem, but it is far different in its characteristics. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author shows how Venus is dangerous but still worthy of studying by giving us evidence and examples about Venus and its features.

The author gives us statistical evidence on how our planet is different from Venus. He explains that its temperature, atmosphere, and its acidic clouds are making the planet uninheritable for humans. The author writes, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planets's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" (3) The other spits out many facts that support his claim that exploring Venus is a very dangerous job. 800 degrees Farenheit is very hot and would not eb suitable by a human. In fact, all of these feaures would make it hard for a human to live on Venus. All these points can help prove that Venus is still worthy of studying even though there are many dangers because it should interests scientists and others to find out how these conditions came to be, what could survive in these harmful conditions, and even possibly how to make it possible for humans to live there.

The author also uses examples to support his claim that Venus is inhospitable for humans. Humans have many needs in order to survive on a planet and Venus does not qualify for many. The author writes ""such an environment woud crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to teh deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals."" (3) In this quote the athor is referring to the pressure of the planet inside the atmosphere. If a submarine could not survive the pressure, I doubt a human could either. The author also says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in out solar system"" and it has ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This is impreessive beause even probes that are specifically made for going to Venus, cant even survive on Venus. This proves that Venus is very dangerous but still worthy of studying because it challenges scientists to find new ways of making stronger probes and new ways to study this planet that prove effective.

The author uses many peices of statictcal evidence and examples to prove his point that Venus is worthy of studying even considering the dangerous conditions. It is worthy because it has insanely harsh temperature, atmosphere, atmospheric pressure, and other harmful characteristics. Would you want to study Venus considering its deadly differences?",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

In the first paragraph the athour doesnt include a claim of why Venus is a worthly prusit despite the dangers it has . But instead gives information on Venus, so that the reader has a good idea of Venus and to understand the dangers of Venus. Like

"" Venus is the second planet from the sun""(paragraph 1). Also he the author does the same thing in paragraph 2.""often referred to as Earths twin ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size""(paragraph 2). And continues to do the same in paragraph 3 by just giving more information on Venus and why is is dangerous.

Its not untell paragraph 4 that the author gives a claim on why Venus is a worthly pursuit despite the dangers wich is . "" astronomers are fascinated by Venus becuase it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (paragraph 4) and this is not a strong claim becuase this claim is not strongly supportingthe authors idea that studying Venus is worth it. But incudes evidence fro paragraph 2 about how earth and venus are referred to as ""twin"" . But in paragraph 8 the ator says ""venus has value , not only becuse of the insight to be gained on the planet itself , but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors""(paragraph8). thius feels like a stronger claim that could help explain why Venus is worth studying.

In the rest of that paragraphs the author does the same thing as in the first few paragraphs witch is just layin down more information on Venus. ""'At thrity-plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit, but air prussure would be close to sea level on earth"".( paraghraph 5) and this just helps the reader unstand why it would be hard to go to Venus. Venus is worth studying becuse curiosity will likely lead us into doing so and we will gain great insight on the planet aslo possible find something new ,and our travels/explorations should not be limited by the dangers Venus aposes.

BC54511398C6,"Having the opportunity to go to Venus and explore would amazing for humans and scientists on Earth. It would give us the ability to learn more about the planets that are around us and why we are the only planet that humans are able to live it. It gives us insight on different planets and we can learn more about their climate, what the rock and sediment is made of, and if humans could have possible ever lived there. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers that it presents and the author supports his claim with educational details about how it can benefit humans, scientists, and our future.

Having a human able to go to Venus and be able to examine it, even if it is from a distant, can be very educational and help us succeed with many other projects. It can help us succeed by providing details about that planet and what it is like. Although we have pictures and images, nothing is better than a human being able to go and see it and report back exactly what he/she saw. In paragraph 8 sentence 1 it says how it will not only insight will be gained on the planet iself, but also because human cuiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. By being able to conquer this one task, humans will most likely be able to conquer many more things.

The author also tells us that being able to have a human go to Venus we will be able to learn more about it. All of paragraph 4 talks about why scientists are so interested on going to Venus and learning more about it. We can learn if it once was like Earth and why it has changed. There are many similiar features between Earth and Venus that support the idea that Venus was once like Earth. It is said, paragraph 4 sentence 3, that long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and coould have supported various forms of life. Although it says probably, by all the facts and research that scientists have done it is most likely that forms of life have existed on Venus. In Paragraph 3 sentence 6 it lists some of the similiar features on Venus that are also displayed on Earth: volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes.

It is not possible for any form of life to survive on Venus currently because of the climate and what the planet is like. The planet itself is so different from Earth in many different ways: temperature, atmostpherical pressure, carbon dioxide, etc. In paragraph 3 the author described the characteristics of the planet and how that even though there are many dangers that could happened by sending a human to Venus, it could be very beneficial to society and to science. Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure it 90 times greater than on Earth. The atmospherical pressure would be able to crush a submarine, even one that could go to the deepest parts of the ocean (paragrpah 3 sentences 3-4).

Scientists are working on a way to get humans to be able to go to Venus. Although it would be so beneficial if they were able to land on the planet itself, the climate does not allow that option. There is also sulfuric acid in the atmosphere that would corrode anything that tried to get down to the planet itself. Scientists have thought of many different things to try to get a human to Venus, but they have not tried any out yet. There was an idea of having humans in a blimp-like object and floating them above the planet by 30 miles. Although they wouldn't be able to get any rock or sediment samples, this would be safer to them than it would be trying to land on the planet itself.

In conculsion, I would like to say that the author did a very good job of supporting his idea that Venus is a worthy persuit despite the possible dangers. He provided enough information to make it relateable to Earth and he also explained why it would be beneficial to humans and to scientists. He explained how this would be a good opportunity to explore our neighboring planet and learn more about, not just planets themselves, but also but the rest of creation and why Earth is the only possible planet to live on and be comfortable in.

521AC6BDADAC,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author encourages humanity to rise up above the obstacles that have stopped us from exploring Venus in the past, and push forward into uncharted territory. He cites several reasons why humans might want to explore a planet with such harsh and unforgiving conditions, and he gives examples of solutions to the problems that these conditions cause. He uses compelling evidence and inspiring diction to support his claim that humanity should work towards exploring Venus. He supports this claim very well. One example of the evidence that he uses to support his claim is the fact that Venus bears many similarities to Earth, making it valuable in scientific reasearch. In paragraph four he writes: ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" He follows this up by explaining that gathering information about Venus could very well provide us with valuable information about our own planet; Earth. The author uses this evidence as the main reason that scientists would benefit from exploring the surface of Venus. One problem that the author encounters is the extremity of the conditions on Venus. However, he offers solutions to this problem later in the article, when he provides information on how NASA would combat the dangerous conditions on the surface and explore Venus without any harm coming to the people involved. In paragraph five he writes; ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the Venusian surface."" The author includes this example of a solution for the harsh conditions of Venus to compell the reader towards believing that exploring Venus would be a valuable use of time and effort for human civilization, due to the fact that it is not only rich with information that could help us explain our own lives on Earth, but also because on the surface of Venus could collect this information without having to risk the safety of the explorers that are involved. This is a powerful use of evidence, because it provides examples of why we should attempt to explore Venus, and it then works towards removing our doubt of this claim by giving us evidence that the risks that would be faced on Venus could be reduced significantly. In conclusion; the author's claim that humanity would benefit greatly from travelling to and exploring Venus is well supported, with both evidence that supports the idea that the information that we would gain would be valuable to us, and evidence that the risks that we would have to take would be small enough to ensure the safety of the people involved. The author inspires us to look beyond what we have at the moment and strive for a better future; one where we can become a multi-planetary civilization that has the ability to explore other planets and, perhaps, other stars.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8

""Venus itself is right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spaccraft to land on this cloud draped word"". No human has never been to Venus in for good reason, which might be the issue that explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more then three decades. The thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Whats more challenging is the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's amtosphere. Venus's planet surface temperature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospher's pressure is 90 times than what people experience on Earth. The conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth, environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of the oceans and also liquefy many metals. Take note that Venus is has one of the most hottest surface temerature in the entire solar system, though Mercury is the closests planet to the sun. But if Venus is so inhospitable, then why are scientists even discussing to move further visit to its surface. That is because Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it most likely have been the most Earth like planet in the solar system. Venus has probably been the most largely coverd with oceans and possibly could have supported lots of various life forms, just like planet Earth. Venus has a surface of rocky sediment and includes simular features such as mountains, valleys and craters. Venus can also sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, giving the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems ""indisputable, but what are the options for making a mission both safe and scientifically productive.

NASA's possible solution to the rough conditions on the surface of planet Venus, could initually allow scientists to float above the fray. Put it like this, a huge blimp like vehicle hovering over 30 or so miles above the Venusian landscape. Just like jetplanes traveling at higher altitudes to fly over many storms, just like a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the bad ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. Many researchers are working hard on innovations that would allow our advance machines to last a long enough to contribute to our knowledge of Venus.

With scientists wanting to send people to Venus to collect data, is a little obsvered in the matter.

2D9394476D45,"The author does a poor job of explaining why Venus should be explored, despite risks. First, they introduce Venus' poor, inhabitable conditions. Then, they go on to suggest an idea that isn't anything but a dream. Finally, they admit that the previous ""solution"" won't even work.

The introduction to Venus in paragraph three, is anything but inviting. The author tells the reader that most of Venus's atmospher is 97% CO2 or carbon dioxide. That is a gas that humans exhale and it's extremely deadly when there is too much. For example, carbon dioxide poisoning. That kills people. It doesn't get better. The author then goes on to explain that the atmospheric pressure is even survivable. The author writes,

""... And the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.""

This line basically tells the reader that if an actual human were to even land there, they would most likely die immediately. If not for the suffocation that would happen because of the excessive amount of carbon dioxide. The author even says, in paragraph two, a robot couldn't survive Venus for, ""more than a few hours."" How well would a human do? This tells the readers of all the dangers, not even offering a benefit, other than to ""meet the challenge.""

Not only does the the author state all the reasons why we shouldn't go to Venus, the solution they have found isn't really a good one. In paragraph five, the author writes, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape... Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author starts with the word ""imagine,"" telling the reader that this idea most likely isn'y even an option. The word imagine has the connotation of something you would want to happen, not neccesarily something that will. They then go on to say that the conditions weren't easy, but at least people could survive.

That sounds great, right? Wrong.

This so-called ""solution"" isn't even a solution.

In paragraph six, the author admits that looking at the planet safely hovering wasn't going to be enough. ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples,"" The auhtor explains. ""Of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.""

This line proves that the the vehicle suggested previously is not even going to work. It will put people in ""survivable"" conditions for basically nothing.

FF9FBDF88EAF,"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger. Throughout the article, the author supports this claim very well. The author gives a few real benefits for exploring Venus. The author continuously tells us, the readers, about advancing technology thanks to human curiosity. The author even gives problems and solutions to explore Venus.

At the end of the article, paragraph 8, the author says, ""Striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This means that by exploring Venus, we will gain knowledge and be prepared for future missions with similar conditions. Paragraph 4 talks about Venus's past like how it ""may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" With knowledge of Venus's past, we could not only learn about Venus more, but we could use that information and compare it to Earth to predict some of Earth's future. That is how Venus's benefits outweighs its dangers.

In paragraph 7, it talks about NASA's interest to study Venus. In doing so, NASA is creating better technology and pushing the human race further. ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such contitions."" With advancing technology thanks to the interest in Venus, we can now create objects that can survive over 800 degrees Fahrenheit on Venus's surface for three weeks. That is how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because we advance with the study.

Throughout the article, many problems are brought up with solutions. For example, paragraph 3 talks about Venus's dangerous conditions that aren't fit for humans, but in paragraph 5, NASA believes they can solve this problem by allowing scientists to float above the chaotic conditions which would allow humans to go to Venus and study it better. Paragraph 6 introduces the problem that humans wouldn't be able to gather a lot of information if they are on a ship orbiting Venus because of its dense atmosphere. In paragraph 7, the article says, ""systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" Paragraph 7 gives us the solution to the problem in paragraph 6. This in turn can also relate to the fact that our technology would advance thanks to the planning for Venus. That is how the author supports his claim by giving us problems and solutions to explore Venus, which negates some of the dangers.

With insight from Venus, advancing technology, and solutions to problems, the author supports his claim. The author tells us about benefits of exploring Venus. The author tells us how technology would advance thanks to the curiosity humans possess for Venus. The author tells us solutions to problems which negates some of the dangers. Therefore, the author supports his claim very well since he gave reasons why the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit, and why some of the dangers aren't a big enough threat to stop humans.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8

It could help the people that are on planet Earth understand what kind of innovations and improvements could be made and possibly create living conditions for organisms in the present or in the future. It would also give a better idea of what is on the planet rather than depending on photography or videography.

The author suggest that is is worth the risk needed to study Venus and he had some compeling arguments. after reading this ask yourself would you take the risk?

Venus is a very extrem environment, with temetures that can melt tin. it is so extream that no space craft had survied more than a few hours on the surface of Venus. The planet had an atmospher of mostly carbon deoxide and is rittles with cloudes of sulfur. Despite all of that the author still belivews we should continue to explore Venus.

on of the authors key pointts was ""...once have been the most earth-like planet inour solar system."" The auter went on to say ""Venus was probably coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth.""

I belive this is a great reason to explore Venus more deeply, because if it has any truth to it why is the planet so deadly now? we should lookinto its past and make an understanding of what happend to Venus so we know what could happen to us and possibly even try and prevent it.

The author concluded thier artical by saying ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also,because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" i belive this is the authors main point, not just that we should know more about the planet but that it keeps us sharp and provieds problems to slove. The human mind is curious and will alway want to ""know how it works"" or ""whys it do that"" and if we dont presue those questions then we are learning nothing.

So in conclusion althoghVenus is an extream environment we should explore it more deeply. We should try to find ways to do so. the author gave many points but his best one was simply that the peopel are curious and want to know so show us.      ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
B8B5B46DA523,"No one has ever landed on venus so the author is saying this because no space ship has survived landing for more than a few hours. maybe the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on veunus more than three decade, venus really is a challanging planet for people to study.

On the surface, temperatures average over 800 degress F and the pressure is 90 times greater than our planet. The conditions are extreme than anything humans encounter, due to the pressure and th heat of venus.

Beyond the pressure and the heat venus has geology and wather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to the land surface. It'll be dangerous even trying to live on venus but if you want to live on vnus be prepared for these desasters. Like for example our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over venus would advoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.

This is why NASA is working on a wat to approach and study venus, like some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tsted in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in the conditions of venus.

In investigating the solar system, Venus shows promises of exploration.

Though Venus itself is denser and hotter than Earth, both planets are one in the same.

The author of the passage utilizes this in explaining as to why investing into the research of this particular planet in the Milky Way is worth it.

The author does this by comparing Venus to Earth within Venus's geometric structures as well as its weather patterns.

Venus can be said to be Earth's twin.

Known as the second planet from the sun, Venus was once like how our planet is today based on scientists' knowledge.

According to the passage the planet,""...(W)as probably covered largely with oceans..."".

Earth contains 70% of water and has life on it and with this quote describing that Venus had water at one point in time, it too might have supported life forms which is what the author is attempting to explain in his writings.

Like Earth, Venus obtains the same landformations.

Another detail provided from the article states,""...surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" indicating not only that this planet once held water but, also sustains land structures identicle to Earth's.

Along with the planets identicle features to Earth's, It also features weather patterns and conditions that are compatible too.

Combining all of this information, Venus can be idealized as Earth.

The author gets to the point by comparing the various landforms, weather, and natural disasters of the two space rocks.

The conditions are more extreme than anything people have experianced before. Venus is also the hottest surface teamperature of any other planet in the solar system.

Even thought there are risks astronomers are surprised by the fact that Venus could've been the most Earth-like planet in the solar system.

How it relates is so many information that people that travel to Venus have to be very careful at what there going for. At most times Venus is a great planet at its presents but also dangerous too.

The writer explains that the nickname given to venus came about because Venus is very easily spotted from Earth even though venus is a planet and not a star. The writer then goes on to say "" While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely"".

Paragraph two and three expains venus is similar to earth but also how Venus is dangerous. Paragraph two opens up how Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"" because of Venus is closest to earth in terms of density and size. The writer then explains how Earth, Venus, and Mars are planetary neighbors and how all three planets orbit the sun at different speeds and how sometimes how Mars will sometimes be closer to Earth and how sometimes Venus is closer to Earth. The writer then goes on to talk about how humans have sent multiple unmanned spacecrafts to venus but none have reached the surface of the planet due to the various factors that make Venus a ""challenging planet for humans to study"". Paragraph 3 explains the dangerous aspects of Venus. The writer opens up with how a ""thick atmosphere of almost nintey seven percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"". The writer then goes on to talk about how average tempatures on Venus are over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit and how the atmosperic pressure is nintey times greater than Earth and that these conditions are far more extreme than Earth's conditions.

Opening up paragraph four the writer asks "" if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists evn discussing further visits to its surface?"". The writer explains that astronomers are interested by Venus because it may have once been ""the most Earth like planet in our solar system"" saying that Venus may have been once covered largely with oceans and could have supported many different forms of life. The writer then says that even now Venus still has vast surfaces of rockey sediment and includes familiar features similar to earth. The writer then makes a statement saying that "" The value of returning to Venus seems indisutable"". Paragraph 5 opens up with how nasa been discussing sending humans to Venus. The writer then goes on to talk about how in order for this idea to work nasa would have to make a special spacecraft that would have to be thirty miles above the surface of Venus. The writer then goes into specifics of how maintaining life on the spacecraft would work.

Paragraph six continues with how the spacecraft would operate. The writer then talks about how scientists would not be able to collect samples from the surface of Venus and how scientists are working on ""innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". Paragraph seven mainly talks about nasa and their other approches to studying Venus. The writer eplains that nasa did a experiment where electrons made of silicon carbide were tested in a chamber simulating the ""chaos of Venus's surface"". The particles only lasted three weeks.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planet's surface temperatures average oner 800 degrees Fathrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Also notable, Venus has the hottest sufrace temperature of any planet of solar system, wheather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, and powerful earthquakes.

The National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) has one particulary idea for sending humans to study Venus, Venus would aviod the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up andout of their way, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. No easy conditions, but survivable for humans.

However, Venus can provide only limited insinght on ground conditions because most forms on light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.

For now humans can't go to explore others planes as Venus, but I think with the step of the time, humans are going to envolving more on their technologies. Something that everyone know clearly, both planets as Mars and Venus have a lot of differences between our planet. Can humans can go to others planes in next close years?

43121098266D,"Did you know that Earth had a twin? Well not exactly a twin, but a planet that is very close to Earth in terms of it's density and size. That planet happens to be

Venus. Since the planet is very identical to earth, we are all going to want to explore it. Exploring and studying Venus comes at a cost though, it is a worthy pursuit despite the presentation of it's dangers.

Venus is a planet in our solar system. It is referred as the ""Evening Star,"" as its one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. It is the second planet from our sun. Many people confuse Venus with being a star, because of its nickname. trying to examine Venus more closely then of the safe vantage point of Earth, can be very challenging despite it being simple to see from the distance.

We are all closer to Mars than Venus sometimes due to the speed changes at which they orbit the Sun by. Us humans send a variety of spacecrafts to the cloud-draped world for it to land on. No spacecraft has survived the landing for a couple hours. This means that all the previous missions to mars were all unmanned. All of these failed missions have explained why Venus hasnt been touched in more than three decades by a single spaceship.

As you can tell Venus is a challenging planet for humans to study because of its reputation. The atmosphere of Venus is very thick as 97 percent Carbon Dioxide covers all of it. The planet's tempatures on the surface average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is greater than what we experience on Earth by 90, all of these conditions are way more extreme than what we experience on Earth. Trying to visit Venus would completly liquefy and melt any spacecraft near it.

Many scientist are trying to explore this planet despite its inhospital conditions because it is very identical to Earth. It used to be one of the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Which facsinated many Astronomers. Venus was probably covered by many bodies of water and forms of life could have been supported, just like Earth. The planet now has a rocky surface with many valley's, mountains, and craters that makes astronomers itch to further expore it. Despite it's very hard conditions to even get near the planet.

Venus is a very cool planet. As it is very Dangerous to further study and explore,It is all worth it in the long run. The planet has very many earth-like qualities. So it would be smart to see if there was any signs of life. Venus is worth all the dangers because its a worthy pursuit.               ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
8888C32CCDD5,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author is trying to explain how the planet Venus is an intresting mission that is dangerous to human life, after many attempted unsucccesful missions NASA is still finding ways to land a spacecraft safely on this planet so information can be collected. Scientist in NASA are very intrested in the planet. It is considered to be ""Earth's twin"".

Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the sky. Made of up 97 percent carbon dioxide, clouds of highly sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, not to mention average tempratures of 800 degrees fahrenheit. Many question NASA about making trips to this planet due the highly unsuitable conditions for humans. In the excerpt it states. ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth, such an enviorment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans."" It shows how harmful to life Venus can be.

People wonder why Scientist are trying to further investigate the Venus's surface if the planet is so inhospitable. Turns out people from NASA and Astronomers are very fascinated by the planet. Researchers say it may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could've supported various forms of life, just like earth."" It is very obvious why researchers want to further investigate. This is very important and could impact all of life on earth. Also NASA are in the process of trying to build protective spacecrafts hospitable to Venus."" It will not be easy conditions, but it is survivable for humans."" stated in the article.

In conclusion, NASA researchers should furthermore investigate into this planet, we never know, it could change our life. Traveling should not be limited by something that can be dealt with if possible. As people in this society we are trying to meet the edges of new inventions, discoveries, and innovation. To make it to that point risk have to be taken.      ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
2B09B90BECB2,"The author has great supports about why we should study the planet of Venus. He called it Earth's twin. He stated that Venus is the closest planet to be comapred to Earth. The author states that blimp-like vehicles would help with the study of Venus.

The author said Venus is Earth's twin because it's the closest planet to have the same density and size as Earth. The author states that we could use blimp-like vehicles to not get burnt or crushed because if the vehicle gets 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape everything would change. The temperature would drop from about 800 degress to 170 degress Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure would drop from 90 times greater than earths surface to about Earth's sea level if the vehicle were to be 30 miles or so above the surface.

All you need to know why we need to study Venus more is all here. Venus is basically Earth's twin so why not study it more. Venus is the closet planet to be compared to Earth with its size and density. Blimp-like vehicles would help with it's flight to 30 miles or so.

BBAF9543F8FD,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author makes a strong point to argue that observing venus is worth taking a risk for. He backs up his claim as well, ranging from strives in science, to just the insight itself.

The author states many strong reasons for his claim. To start off, one of the reasons the author gives for a observitory visit to Venus is because it, ""Can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" This shows that he is trying to back up his original claim with the fact that its perhaps the closest option we have for these visits. Also the author strides to say that it will give more knowlage on Venus if we study it. ""Not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet (paragrpah 8)."" This also backs up what he is saying because the fact that more can be learned from Venus alone, is a huge reason for some to go observe this planet.

In conclusion, the author makes a point to say a observitory visit to Venus would be behnificial and supports his claim very well using facts and explaining what and why some of his reasons should be taken seriously. Therefore, the author did a great job in backing up his claims and explaining them thuroghly.    ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
B47DABE530F2,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" it gives you many reason why we should explore Venus. You can tell from this artical, although there are many dangers that might be presented there are many good thing that can come. Some people believe that life can be found in other planes. The author gives us valid reason why we should explore Venus. He states that Venus is closes to the Earth, he also states that Venus and Earth have many similarity. Lastly because of the challenge.

In the first Paragraph, the author says that Veuns is often referres to as Earth's twin. Venus is the the closest planet to earth distnace wise. Also the density and size are very similar. Since the sun orbits at different speed sometimes we are closer to mars and other time we are closer to venus. Venus is sometimes right around the corner. Since somethimes it is the closes plane towards us humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus. Meaning we can gather more information on it.

Venus may have once been the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. Many years ago, Venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various form of life. Today Venus still has features that are analogous to those on earth. The author states the plante has a rocky sediment and familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus can be our nearest option for planetary visit.

Lastly, facing the challenges presented by Venus has a important value. Human curiosity will most likely lead us into many equally intimdating endeavors. Our travels on earth should not be limited by the dangers and doubts it should be expanded to meet the last edges of imagination. By trying to explore Venus we could have a better understanding . As the human population grows we will need more space than earth. If sicentist could find a way to form human life it would be helpful to everyone and everything around us.

In conclusion, the author states the artical with many valid facts and gives a good and strong supporting ideas. There are many thing we can benifit from if we challenge and explored Venus. The author also gave very good and constructive reason as to facts. He also gaves us the prositve and negtives but told us how the positive out ruled the negitive in many ways.

It also says that "" not a single spaceship has toched down on venus in more then three decases. No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours and no one had ever been there."" You could be the first one to land on Venus. This proves that since it is a dangers planet it would still be worthy seeing it. Now, lets talk about why it wouldn't be worthy seeing it.

Would it really be worth seeing Venus because it had a lot of danger. It says in the text that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.

Venus is called earth's twin becaue as in the text it states ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms to density and size, and occasionally the closet in distance too.""(paragraph 2). we know we have a planet that is like earth can be one of the most exciting thing to know. we can survive on another earth is another.

If we were to ever go to venus we will be able to live there but with harsh conditions.

Going to Venus would be dangerous but in realtiy if we don't go and study our earths twin we might not ever have the knowlege we can have by going. in the article it states ""The value of returning to Venus seems indispoutalde, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive.""(paragraph 4). if we don't try we won't learn anything new about what we don't have.

Also in paragraph 2 says ""each previous mission was unmmaned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.

In the paragraph 3 it says many reasons of why it is dangerous to go to study Venus more closer, it is dangerous to study Venus even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

57624CC87025,"Using details from the article, i can write an essay evaluating how well the author supports the idea, that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by, while yes there are many risks to exploring Venus and other planets but in the long run it could help out. The reason it could help out is if we found a planet near ours like venus that in some way shape or form could be inhabited by humans it could give society and its people more places to go so we dont have as many over populated areas. an other big reason we could benefit from figuring out if venus can be inhabited is if that planet has usefull resources we can stop using as many GMO'S as we do in our foods.

A place that has the biggest issue of having overpopulation and has to resort to using GMO'S in there foods is japan. some places in japan the overpopulation is so bad that it has created a very large increase in the amount of polution that is in the air, Its so bad in some areas that in the morning you can see the polution while just walking which has made it so the kids/adults of japan have to wear some sort of mask to not get sick/ get poisened by the air. If we do end up figuring out that venus and some other planets in our solar system can be inhabited we can decrease this issue by sending some of those people to Venus. It's not only in japan that this issue of overpopuation is occuring, you can see it occuring more and more in the USA with all the refugees and people from other parts of the world coming to live in the USA.

The reason i am making these claims and the information i am using to support my reasoning is, in the text it stated that. "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth. Today, Venus still has some of the features that are analogous to those of Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. If scientist can conform that Venus was once inhabited by some sort of life form, they can possibly figure what type of life form this was and maybe figure out why they are no longer there. If they can figure out why that certain life form left or died off we can possibly reverse what had happened. which will lead us to being able to inhabite another planet and could reduce the amount of over population and further problems here on earth by splitting up our population. It could also help the human race live longer and help so that the human race does not die off. In the long run i do think that figuring out if the planet Venus can be inhabited, i also think that from my information and the information that the author gave you to can see the reason why this discovery is so crusual to our society and race.

7DA90CFB37DA,"Venus is one of the most intersting and eye cathhing planets known to Earth by scientist. It is considered the ""twin"" of planet Earth making it a very special planet in our solar system. Do not let that fool you though, even if it is called the ""twin"" of Earth it is still very different in many ways from our planet. In this essay I will be Discussing about the issues brought up by the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" Is Venus really worth studying even despite the dangers it presents?

Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth. It is very simialr to Earth in both density and size too. Since Venus is so close compared to most planets around Earth humans have found alot of interest in the planet. Humans have sent many unmanned spacecrafts to Venus but none of the spacecrafts have survived the landing for more than a few hours. There are many reasons why is it challenging for us to make a succeful exploration for many reasons. Veus has a very thick atmosphere of aproxametly 97% carbon dioxide and with clourds of sulfuric acid. Another factor to consider is that it ha a temperature on the averages of 800 degress Fahrenheit and over with atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than which experinced here at Earth. The weather experienced in Venus is also very dangerous. There are many errupting volcanoes, very powerful earthquakes and lighting striking very frequent. These conditions make it almost impossible for Venus to sustane life and making explorations. With all of these very difficult situations to take in consideration the question is brought up agin. Many scientist have been thinking and discussing about more frequent visits but why? Well it is because as it says in paragrapgh 4 ""Astonomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". there are many theroies that Venus may have long ago been probably covered by large oceans and maybe could have ad a chance of supporting many various forms of life because Venus shows some features and characterisitcs alike those of Earth. Scientists from NASA have been brainstorming with ideas of how to make explorations to Venus possible and more likely to survive. Well an idea in paragrapgh 5 explains""Imagine a blimp-like vehcile hovering 30 or so milea above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vechicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfreindly ground conditions by staing up and out their way."" This may seem like a good idea but it has its flaws. hovering over the clouds would make it difficult for them to collecet any rocks or anything to sudy and it would also be hard to view the floor and write descriptions of what has been seen.

Even though Venusis a very interesting planet and it shares alot of Earths characteristics I believe that there wasnt enough evidence to support the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. If there was actually ideas and details that would make it seem like it is possible for there to be a safe and sucessful exploration instead of ideas that have a slight chance of working I would have agreed.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
CA8264D7097C,"In ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" Venus is also known as ""Evening Star"". Venus is one of the brightest points in the sky at night. It is also the second closest planet to Earth,that's why we can see it at night. Mars is also close to us but only at certain times, it all depends on speed otherwise how fast it orbits around us. The atmosphere on Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide which means there's no air, the clouds are made of corrosive sulfuric acid. The temperature is over 800 degrees fehrenheit.

The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater, so if we were to send any type if mechanical transportation over there, it would into liquid as soon as it gets there. Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any other plant in our solar system. Venusian geology says that their are additional impediments the erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning stikes. That means their are multiple natural disasters going on at the same time. Astronomers think that long age, Venus was like our planet (Earth).

The planet has a surface of rocky sediment like mountains, craters and valleys.

NASA thinks that they could put a blimp or some kind of futuristic jet airplanes in outerspace. In the article, NASA was talking about electronics made of ""silicon carbide"". If NASA could add silicon carbide to a jetplane and some how remote control the aircraft, it might work. I noticed how the author capitalized the ""Venus, NASA, Earth, and all the other planets.

0F23D0A1E0F0,"What the author was suggesting when he was saying venus is dangerous but a worthy pursuit. Was that no spacecraft survived more that a couple of hours on venus. The atmosphere was dangerous to people. It has the hottest surface temperature.

The first reason you cant go onto Venus is because no spacecraft lasted more than a couple of hours on Venus. If a spacecraft couldn't survive on Venus there is no way that a human can survive.

The second reason that man cannot be on Venus is because the atmosphere is dangerous to humans. The atmosphere is almost 97 percent cardon dioxide. Which is deadly to humans. Its like being trapped in an small airtight box with no holes.

The last reason that humans can't be on Venus is because it also has the hottest surface temperature of all the planets. While also having many active volcanoes, earthquakes and more frequent lightning strikes.

What about a planet that at ground level, has far more extreme conditions than humans can handle? This is what exploring our planetary neighbor Venus would be like. Even though the author claims it would be worthy to make the dangerous trip to Venus, he does a poor job of supporting his claim.

The author uses a credible source, NASA, but the author fails to back up why the pursuit is worthy. The information from NASA talks about possible solutions to the harsh conditions of Venus, but not about why the trip should be made, despite all the harsh factors. The text states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" The author has valid reasoning for solutions, but this information does not mention why it would benefit us to risk lives just to make the adventure.

The author also includes an abundance of information about how dangerous and risky Venus is, and yes it is important to know these facts, but in the beginning of the article, the author seems to scare the audience into not traveling to Venus. Paragraph 3 states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquify many metals."" The author goes into detail about just how deadly Venus would be to humans, instead, if he was trying to prove that it is a worthy point, the author should've been lighter about these facts and not gone into such scary, vivid detail; the author also could've added a counterargument in this paragraph instead of waiting until later in the essay to start showing what he was actually trying to prove.

The author could've included more evidence to support his view, but he did provide one piece of sufficient evidence. Paragraph 4 reads, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This piece shows that some scientists want to explore Venus for its ancient possible ability to explore life, but the author needed to support his claim with other information, other than strictly in this paragraph.

Ultimately, the author did have evidence in his article, but there needed to be more in order to make his claim well-supported and also more credible. Exploring Venus may be a good idea, but the author's claim wasn't clear enough throughout the essay to be able understand his point.

""By comparsion, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"". These evidence proves how NASA are trying different approaches and they are making different kind of new technology so they can withstand the harsh condition of Venus, and striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

Besides the point Venus can reach up to extreme levels of heat from how close it is to the sun and all the fumes or carbon dioxide. Speakin of carbon dioxide majority of Venus think atmosphere is almost 97percent carbon dioxide.

So the dangers of Venus is that each previous mission was umanned and that was for a good reason. ""since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"" (Paragraph 2). The atmosphere of it is almost 97% of carbon dioxide. The clouds are made of highly corrosive sulfuric acid.

But even though that there are these dangers on Venus Astronomers are not going to stop with this. Venus must of had been like Earth once before in the solar system. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" (Paragraph 4). The planet has a rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters that are on Earth today.

So the question is what are the choices that is going to both keep the mission safe and scientific productive? Well The National Aeronautics and Space Administration known as NASA has an idea to this solution. Since there is terrible conditions on the surface of Venus. The only was to survive is to be above the ground. So the idea is that having a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the landscape. Thus, even being above it would still be hot around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be kind of like Earth's sea level. And there would be plentiful solar power. And since sending elctronics there would melt it mechanical machines would withstand the dangers of Venus.

Regardless of all the challenges that come with it, getting to know the surface and history of this close planet could better pevent ours from turning into a replica.

A couple of statements that fascinated me about Venus is that it has the hottest surface tempurature in our solar system with an average temperature of over 800 degrees Farenheit. That is truly mind-boggling seeing as how Mercury is the closest planet to our sun, not Venus. To make matters worse the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we expirence on Earth, therefore, making it very hard to explore the surface. Even just getting close to the surface you would have to deal with eruptions, earthquakes, and lightning strikes.

The risk is incredible but the information provided from this planet may very well save us all one day. As stated, Venus was the most Earth-like planet in our soar system meaning the same thing could happen to us eventually. Even though Venus could have substained life in the past, now is very unlikely. How could we find out more about this interesting planet if we cannot go near it?

As of right now, technologically speeking, we are far to inadvanced to send anything to the surface, let alone humans. The safest possibility to even get close would be to float in a structure roughly 30 miles above the surface. Even at that distance the temperature would still stand at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level.

In conclusion, I feel that if there was a way to study Venus close up without all the provided risks and more, then we should invest. Many great things could come from any planet alone but this one is just amazing. Do you think Venus is worth it?                ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
6.84E+11,"Studying a planet called Venus is worthy pursuit but it is dengrous. As we have seen in the paragraph exploring Venus can teach us alot of things and there is alot of things that we can learn in Venus like if there is a life in there or if we can grow something there but no man have put his foot on it because it is too dengrous and too hard to go over there.

As we seen in the first paragraph Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" because it is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus is also known as Earth's ""twin"" since it is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. Venus is sometimes right around the corner and humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each pervious mission is no man which mean just airplane or robot because no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, that is the reason the no man have ever step on it. For others reason it is too hot even though Mercury is closer to our sun. The averange on the planet surface is 800 degrees which can kill us and it has greater pressuer than earth. It is 90 times greater than earth. The others reason is that it has powerful earthquakes,erupting, and frequent lightning steikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. To get over there NASA is trying to make thing that can land on the planet and stay for a very long time, so that they can explore.

So alot of our people are trying to go to Venus but it is challenging. They are trying and become stronger. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited b dangers and adoubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2

8E6FA034C8DA,"In the passage ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author thinks that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In the passage the author has put and many details supporting his idea of studuing Venus. The author uses many good details to support his idea. For example, how they came up with an idea that could keep the people safe but they wouldn'nt be able to get any sample of anything without being in to much danger. However there are still more ideas.

In this passage it says that NASA has come up with a couple ideas to explore Venus. One of their ideas was to hover a ship about 30 miles from above Venus's surface and still me able to observe from there. This supports his idea that they can still exlpore it they just wont be able to get close up and explore it better. There was also another idea that NASA came up with.

Their next idea was to send a spacecraft up but when they did it only sayed up for maybe two hours without failing. Although their first plan failed witht the spacecraft they came up with another idea for sending spacecraft back to Venus. They found a material that might be able to support the spacecraft from the heat. In order to see if this spacecraft woud work the tested it in a similator that was close to what was happening to venus and the spacecraft lasted up to three weeks in the conditions alot longer than the last one. This is another idea that supports his idea of still exploring it because they might of found a safer and better way to do it.

In the end the author of this passage has many details to support his idea of exploring Venus. They have found safer and better ways to explore Venus so why would they not do it. His idea is proven to be posible and he supports his idea very well in this passage.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
3E58B8D1B62F,"I dont believe that the authors Justifications for visiting venus are great enough for us to risk losing human lives. As stated in the passage temperatures average around 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that of earth's. This would mean absolute death for for any type of exploration around of venuses surface if something wrong were to happen.

One way to manage survival on the planet was to use a blimp type vehicle to stay away from most of the venuses dangers. Even if it did manage to work very little insight of how the terrain of venus is like would be aquired do to light not being able to penetrate the dense atmosphere. So it is possible to survive but who knows that this theory would go seamlessly. What if a series of unfortunate events were to happen and innocent men were slaughtered because of venuses harsh envirenmont.

Why should innocent men be killed just because of scientist wanting to satisfy they're curiosity.

The final part of the passage states that our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edge of imagination and innovation. This means that they would do irrational things just to accomplish they're desires. I believe that this is dangerous and could have terrible results for our future. Why are we studying other planets when we have our own issues to deal with. It seems as though the government funds NASA to set out and accomplish things like this that doesn't benfit our lives or the future of this country. Lets say Everything goes perfectly and they study venuses until they're hearts content. Now the government has wasted an enormous amount of money on something idiotic that does not benefit society at all but hey at least now we can say we have been to Venus and thats it. Their is so much more ways they could put that money into good use but instead they want to find more about something floating in space.

C4EEFF2FEC23,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author believes that Venus is worthy of human research and time although the task poses multiple dangers. I stand by the authors claim because we would gain information on how our universe works, and how it was many millions of years ago. The article states that although Venus is sometimes ""around the corner"", humans have sent many unmanned spacecrafts to attempt to explore and learn about Venus as a planet. Those spacecraft have not survived landing for more than a couple of hours. This has discouraged humans enough that we have yet to send another spacecraft to Venus in over three decades.

The challenges are very rough and will not be anywhere close to a easy task. First they have to get through a thick atmosphere almost consisting of 97% carbon dioxide. After the atmosphere, you will have to survive the clouds which consist of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Then you would need to figure out how to help deal with its average surface temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit making it the hottest surface temperature of any planet in out solar system.

Next, you'll have to create something sturdy enough to withstand its atmospheric pressure which amost 90 times geater than Earth's. The geolocial features and weather such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes will also aid in ruining the journey.

If we can overcome these obsticles we could learn much more about Venus's past, present, and future. The more knowledge we have will help to futher even more research and hopefully explore even more in our universe.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
98AB059A3390,"Venus is a dangerous planet, despite being called the ""Evening Star"", that scientists want to get more information about. Venus is the brightest ""star"" we see in the night sky, and tht's how it got it's nickname. This is caused by the extreme amount of heat that is being emitted into the atmosphere of space. The author suggests that Venus should be studied, decpite the dangers, because scientists believe it was once like Earth, NASA suggests having scientists floating above the fray, and NASA is trying to make technology for safer research, so that humanity can learn more about the solar system and find new dicoveries on other planets.

First and foremost, scientists belive this 800 degree planet once held life forms like the ones a person would see on Earth. In paragraph 4, the author states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" Then the author talks about the different types of rocks and land forms, as well as the fact that it's the ""nearest option for a planetary visit."" This explains how Venus could have once been like Earth at one point. Nasa has a couple interesting ways of seeing if these theories are fact or fiction.

Secondly, NASA is thinking of different ways to study Venus. In paragraph 5, the author proclaims, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehical hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehical hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" Soon, the author writes about the temperature and the pressure these people would have to deal with. This would show that NASA is thinking of sending scientists above the fray to observe Venus. If sending humans doesn't work out, technology will save the day, or research in this case.

Lastly, NASA wants to also try out technology to study Venus from a safe place, back on Earth. In paragraph 7, the author states, ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexable, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme conditions. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" Earlier in the same paragraph, the author is putting that people have alredy tried to make some kind of technological device that can withstand the forces Venus throws at them. This shows that NASA is working on the technological approach to gain more knowledge of Venus.

All in all, Venus is a dangerous planet that scientists are curious to study and understand. The author believes it's a worthy pursuit, despite the inhospitable conditions because it's simular to the Earth, and NASA is trying to send people and technology up into space so they cay study the planet, so people can learn about the solar system and the planets. This is how great scientists are created, by studying the impossible.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
D976819A8E94,"Not many details are in the passage to support this idea. There are actually many reasons not to sudy this planet. For example the atmosphere is tpp thick with carbon dioxied. The author supports this claim by saying; ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxied blankets Venus. Dispite all of the reasons not to sudy this planet, the author privides some interesting reasons on why we should.

Venus might be habital by humans one day. Even though Venus conditions are not standard to earths they are livable. To support this claim the author states, 'Not easy conditions but survivable for humans."" There must be some way humans can survive in these rough conditions. Technology, that can support us, to live on Venus can be invented. In order to makes projects like this we would need a closer look to the surface.

Venus is extremely close to the sun. This planet is actually the second closest planet to the sun. Venus being so close to the sun is very benifical to us,we could get a obundant amount of solar energy. supporting this claim the passage states ""Solar power would be plentiful and radiations would not exceed Eaqrths levels.""

Venus is similar to earth thats why it has the nickname ""sister planet"". The planet got this name based off its density and size also it is occasionaly close to earth. Because this planet is so close it would be easier to explore. many spacecrafts have been sent to this planet to study it.

DIspite all of the challenges of exploring Venus there are also sone good that comes from it. If cobnditions of this palnet are stablized for humans we can one day live here. Venus could also have many helpful resources. The planet would provide plenty of solar energy. Human curiosity continues to drive us to explore this hot gas like planet.

FE7AB0719DAB,"In the text the author suggests that Venus is worth the pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He supports the fact that Venus is the sister planet to us and that it could have once been another earth and had all kinds of life and water on it. He proves in the text that he supports it strongly because the way things are they arn't able to conduct a thorough study and mission. They need to have a closer look and intake on the plannet to do the right amount of work needed to be done.

In the text the author plainly state's that what they are doing and how hey are studying Venus isn't effective. It would be if they where to go and despite the danger's get a closer look. He thinks strongly that the way things are they are unable to get samples and find out actuall good data on the sister planet. As it states in the text ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"" (Paragraph,6). This shows that the author believes that it is important to get closer in on the the planets survice to conduct the proper evaluation and tests.

The author feels as though it is worth the while to try and work around these dangers. He feels this planet has alot to offer them on as far as information goes. That their is a good possibility that this planet could have been another earth. As it shows in the text ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (Paragraph, 4).This goes to show that because of the planet possibly being an old earth It makes the research more valuable.

The authore suggests that Venus is worth the dangers to get a good look at what really lays along the surfice. He supports this strongly believing that Venus is a sister planet and could have once even been another earth. He shows in the text that he supports this strongly because the way things are they arnt able to get a good read on things their that they arn't close enough. To him getting closer means getting more in tell and samples. They need to have a closer look on the planet to get better evidence and facts support behind if this planet really used to be a earth once.

7D65B1BD2697,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" I do not think the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit very well. He also supports it a little and instead focuses on the dangers of the planet. Some of the dangers he says is that no spacecraft has even lasted a few hours on Venus, and that tempratures are around 800 degrees. The planet has to harsh of an atmosphere for us to visit.

The author almost seems like he should be supporting not going to Venus. In the third paragraph he talks about how deadly of an enviroment it is. He says that the atmosphere is made of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and that the clouds are made of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. These things alone would make it nearly impossible for any type of life to exist, so why explore a place where its imposible for anything to have ever lived there. With 97 percent carbon dioxide it could have been a possibility for plant life, but he then adds that on the surface it is over 800 degrees Fahenheit. With that kind of heat its impossible to survive.

To make things worse the author is not just talking about an unmaned spacecraft visit, he is talking about humans visiting it. With the atmospheric pressure around 90 times greater than Earth, we would die before we even reached the surface. Even if you were to get to the surface the there are still many obsticals to overcome. Life for example volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and lightning strikes.

One of the only times the author supports his idea is in paragraph 4. The author says ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" While that may sound interesting that is a huge probably. They are basing this off the fact that Venus has some of the same features of Earth like valleys and mountains. That is to big of a risk to take because it could cost millions of dollars and even a life if we sent a human there.

In paragraph 5 the author talks about ideas that could be used to send humans there like a blimp. To me that just sounds to risky because you can do all the testing you want but it only takes one small mistake for everything to go south. The value of Venus that he talks about is insight gained and because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. The values he talks about here are simply not enough. The risks by far outweights the rewards.

That was why to me the author did not support his idea well enouth. To me he gave more dangers that he did rewards. Plus risking a human life is not to be taken lightly, you need to be 100% certain that they will survive. With tempratures above 800 degrees and an atmospheric preassure 90 times greater than Earth I don't see how anyone could survive. Even when a drone does not survive how is a human supposed to? That is why the author did not support the idea well enough. ",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8

Its like having something spinning around everyday. Eventually, something is gonna go wrong and its gonna mess everything up. On the other hand, People who study space would know the answer to what will happen if they was to touch. The author basically wants others to care about the world. He wants others to see both parts of the world. It doesnt matter if something is bad you should still have respect and love in it because its here for a reason.

EC3DD758D9F0,"Venus, a planet, also know was Evening Star, is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky which is a misleading point since Venus is a planet thats is the second planet from our sun and often referred as Earth's twin due it being the closest planet to Earth in terms of its density and size and its occasionally distance as well. In space terms Venus is considered to be right around corner which has lead to humans sending many of their spacecraft to land their spacecraft on Venus which caused each previous mission to be considered unmanned mainly because no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours and as a result it explains the reason why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades and that nemerous factors contribute to Venus´sreputation as a challenging planet to study, despite is proximity to us.

Venus has conditions that are far more extreme than anything humans can encounter on Earth and also notable Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Mercury planet surface temperature averages over 8000 degrees Fahrenheit and the atomsphereic pressure that is 90 times greature than we experience on our planet and such an environment would even crush a subermarine that is made to explore the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Venus has a thick atmosphere that is made of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and blankets Venus. The most challenging are the clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus´s atmosphere. Venus geology and weather introduces natural disaters such as erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes, which makes it harder to land on Venus without experiencing one of these dangers.

Despite Venus being very dangerous, astronomers are fascinated by Venus because they believed it was once have been the most Earth-like planets. Astronomers also believed Venus was once covered largely with Oceans could have supported various form of life we may have not been familiar with just like on Earth. Venus also some things that are simlar to Earth such as the rocky surface that include familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus can also be considered our nearest option for a planetary visit, which is a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.

0C71097D3AE1,"Being dedicated to something and then not being able to even view it or go after that goal that you are dedicated to would really suck. Thats what is happening with Venus, Venus hasn't been able to be viewed due to fact that this planet is a very dangerous planet. However, Venus is a very unique planet, it shares many of the similar characteristics as Earth it's self does. Venus however is a very dangerous planet to be on or to be around, this has caused people to not be able to further study the planet of Venus. However, NASA has been coming up with ways on how they could make this work, how they could get someone to Venus safely so they can do more research on this planet. The author supports his suggestion through his views of how dangerous this planet really is, how this planet is unique which gives reasons on why it is worth it, and lastly by showing us how this pursuit is possible.

First, Venus is very dangerous and astronomers really do not know what to expect since no one has ever stepped foot on Venus. Venus is very hot, a lot hotter than Earth is, and human bodies are not used to the climate that is on Venus which makes it very dangerous and very risky for the human body. In paragraph 3 it states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressue is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Venus is a very dangerous planet due to the fact that human bodies can not handle being aroud that climate, safely atleast. Also, the author also states in paragraph 3, ""Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" All of those weather impediments are very dangerous and no human should go through that because it is very life threatening. By going up to Venus these astronomers are risking their lifes and are putting their lifes in great danger. They have no clue what to expect because no one in human history has been to this planet. These weather impediments are huge reasons on why no one has ever stepped foot or landed on Venus.

Lastly, NASA has been compelling ideas on how they can send humans to

Venus safely, but still allowing them to learn more about this planet. The article states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" Because of these weather impediments, no human can land of the planet without dying, so NASA came up with an idea that will get these scientists there safely and still allow them to observe the planet. The article also states, "" Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" By using this vehicle it would hopefully be keeping the scientist out of danger. Even though Venus is a very unsafe planet for humans there is still one way that could possibly get humans to the planet safely.

The author supports his suggestion that going up to venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers veru well. The author demonstartes how dangerous the planet is and how harmful it can be to humans. The author shows why it is worthy to pursuit it by showing the audiance the characteristics of the planet, whats on it, what happens on, and what the planet is like. Lastly, he showed the audiance that it is possible to allow scientists to study further on Venus by being upclose to it and actually seeing the planet. This article further demostrated that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it may present.                                                            ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
2B5DBA7BA333,"Was there another Earth like the one you are living on right now? I and all the NASA researchers ask you this question in a sense that you will understand. Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago Venus was probaly covered with oceans and life forms. We know this because Venus has surface features that look like Earth's. Through the use of technology, researchers found valleys, mountains, and craters on Venus, leading us to think that it is extremly similar to Earth.

Venus is the second clost planet to the sun and regulates a 800 degree temperature on it's surface. The atmosphere is also covered in thick sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide clouds (author 3). These vile conditions make it impossible for technology to touch the surface. You may ask if it's impossible why are we still trying. The answer is that Venus is extremly similar to Earth and could possibly reveal secrets of the universe.

Through technology researchers have found reminents of valleys, mountains, craters, and oceans. Making it possible that a form of life was once there. Was there life? What happened to the planet? These are questions that are fueling researchers to uncover the true nature of Venus.

In conclusion Venus is analogous to Earth. Reminents of oceans, valleys, and valleys were found. From this knowledge scientists infered that Venus could have supported life. Unfortunelately we are having trouble testing this theory since Venus' surface is 800 degrees.

Venus and Earth are very alike, which is a good things. IT would help us humans alot if the popluation kept on growing.

Another reason is it could help us with futuristic things. Better things than what he whave right now. In the article it stated,"" Venus and Earth are very alike, which is a good things. It would help us humans alot if the popluation kept on growing"" ( paragraph 5). We can find and build different tools to help us reach Venus and to study more about what could be our future planet.

While i see the authors mindset on this article, there are many con's to the ""twin"" planet. Its not very survivable land for us to stay and live in. In the text it says,""

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it Presents.

Venus is our next Planet howerer it has prove a very challenge place to examine more closely. The author supports this idea by all of the information given in the article. Everytings the author saying in The Challenge of Exploring Venus are not easy but they are survivable for humans.

venus is a planet it's pretty close to Earth and Humans want to study about it, to know stuff about it but at the same time is a danger but people can't let's the danger stop them. Like NASA did she's working on other approaches to studying Venus, we knows that is a danger but don't forget the danger can change into a good thing, imagine how beautiful it is for people living in venus.

The idea of sending humans to study Venus is not a bad idea but is a very challenging idea.

The author did a pretty good job in the article, i am really enjoy it.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
1289C8AF32C4,"The author supports this idea because the article gave out specific reasons to why studying Venus is a worthy to pursuit. The article gave out facts about Venus in one of the paragraphs. Another reason is that what would happen to Venus in the future.

Lastly, sending humans to Venus and scientists studying how long they could last.

Here are some reasons why they should suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our sun. High pressure and heat, Venusian geology and the weather present additional impedimets like erupting volcanoes, and powerful earthquakes, like here on Earth. On Earth we present those here on our everyday life. On Venus the planet's surface temperature the average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater that we have experienced on Earth.

In the past

Venus was probably covered largely with ocean water and might have or could supported various forms of life. Venus still has some feature that are analogous to Earth. Venus sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, so that means we can go there for a proportional time. Going to Venus seems to indisputable. A crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel.

Sending humans to Venus is really risky because jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus could avoid the ground conditions by staying up into outer space. Thirty-plus miles about the surface, temperature would still be hot at around 170 degrees. They're are not easy conditions, but the survivable for humans. Researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else because of the distance. Scientists seeking to conduct a through missions to understand what Venus would get up close and personal despite the risks. Researchers are going to work on innovations that would allow there machines to go long enough to contribute meaningfully.

After all, these are the reasons why I think its good idea to suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers of it's presents. I think after I got the information form the article. I think they can make machines that can last long for us to travel to Venus. Another reason is that we can make it, and it is possible for us to get gas and rocks from Venus.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2

Paragraph 7 says,""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface."" This means that the electronics were being tested for the study of Venus. Paragraph 7 also says,""Modern computers are enormously powerful,flexible, and quick.""This article tells us how these electronics would be needed to study Venus and how it could be in dangers.

D16D974BDF01,"Who knew that a planet referred to as Earth's ""twin"" could possibly provide so many unknowns to humans? Venus is the second planet in our solar system and is the ""closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"". Venus has a more harsh environment than Earth. With a surface temperature of over 800 degrees, and a thick atmosphere of nearly 97 percent carbon, Venus is not tolerable for humans. Despite these presented dangers, the author of the article suggests that studying Venus is worth the risks.

The author of the article mentions clearly in paragraph three the intolerable living conditions of the planet Venus. Although the author has knowledge of these dangers, they claim that studying the Earth-like planet is worth it. In order to back up their claim, the author provides facts in the texts to convince the reader of the following: ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" This excerpt for example, may cause the reader to make inferences about other similarities between Earth and Venus, and would spark more interest in learning about Venus.

In addition to similar physical features, the author mentions how Venus is ""our nearest option for planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" This is a very vital fact, and significantly backs up the authors claim. Many planets and stars are several hundred light years away, making space travel and new discoveries by humans difficult. The closeness of Venus would allow humans to visit Venus, if there was a safe way to get there.

Leading off of the previous statement, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been formulating a solution to ""the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus... Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"". This would allow scientist to get extremely close to the surface of Venus, yet not close enough to gather samples from the planet itself.

The author of the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author was able to effectively support the idea that studying Venus is worth the risk, as it is the nearest planet to visit, as well as the idea of a blimp-like vehicle allowing close access to the planet to make new scientific discoveries. Despite the dangerous temperatures, and atmosphere composed of nearly 97 percent carbon dioxide, the author provided many examples as to why studying Venus is worth the risk to make new discoveries, and gather beneficial information about Earth's so- called ""twin"".

For example, the author says that there is a thick atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon dioxide, not only that but the clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acid. The surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times that of Earth's. The author also mentions that the geology and weather is chaotic as well. The author manages to give some evidence for each of the dangers of Venus. He or she states that scientists can hover thirty-some miles above the surface to avoid geological and most weather hazards. It is also said that hovering up high will decrease the temperature down to about 170 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure to Earth's sea level. This gives the idea that a human survivng on Venus is not easy but possible. The author gives that fact that NASA is currently working on electronics that can withstand Venus's surface, and the longest it has lasted is three weeks, so scientists can gather artifacts from Venus and study them.

The author has described the negative, dangerous conditions of Venus's surface and atmosphere. ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than whate we experience on our own planet"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). The author is showing how dangerous the conditions can of Venus can be and how they are more extreme than anything humans have face on Earth. The author shows the readers a way that humans can study Venus that is much safer, along with technologies that will increase the information that humans back on Earth will recieve. ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray..."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This shows that scientists are coming up with ways to make exploring Venus a little safer, still not the easiest conditions but survivable enough to gain more information on the captivating planet. The author explains that there are other approaches to studying Venus, such as simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that can last up to three weeks in the conditions of Venus and the possibility of using old technology is also in the air. ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers..."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Since modern computers are delicate when it comes to extreme conditions, mechancical computers, that have mechanical parts, can withstand more pressure, heat, and other conditions that it will face on Venus. This evidence shows that people are looking for a way to make exploring safer and striving to meet more intimidating endeavors. The strive to meet challenges will give us more ways and technologies to explore more of Earth and other planets similar to that of Earth.

The author has done well in supporting his idea by showing both sides, the dangers and worthiness and steps scientists are taking for exploring Venus. With the work towards meeting the challenges faced on Venus, exploration will not only give insight of the planet but also will lead humans into many equally challenging, intimidating endeavors.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by giving all the reason why humans should go, bad things that could happen if humans landed on Venus, and things they can do to make this idea work.

NASA already beleives that there could be life on Mars and that people could be living on Mars in a couple decades or even less, so why wouldn't they want to find that out about another planet.

""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"",which is one of the reasons it is so earth like (4). Also it is important to learn more about Venus becuase we currently contain little knowlege about Venus becuase ""researches cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"" (6). For these reasons it is important for NACA and other scientists across the world to continue to try and gain a more vast arae of information.

In conclution, while Venus has presented many obsticles for scientists to get around, they find the prize of great value. Although Venus is extremly hard to explore because of its ruff teraine and extreme temperatures. Scientists find it to be of great value because of its Earth like appeal and its unknown information.

48984D541995,"Scientists and more specifically astronomers are extremley fascinated in Earth's sister planet, Venus, as it is similar to Earth in certain ways, and is a close enough distance for travel. Venus was believed to once be very similar to Earth in terms of its geology, so therefore scientists are interested in discovering how the features have changed. However, the author of ""The Challenge Exploring Venus,"" explains the great dangers that the planet offers for both humans and technology to explore the planet. The act of returning to Venus seems impossible due to the risks, although the insight that is wanted to be gained on the planet could lead to ""intimidating endeavors."" The author claims that the studying of Venus is still an active pursuit despite the dangers that come along with it. The claim is supported well by using previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics that catch the readers attention.

The author tells the story of previous missions that have been sent to Venus in hopes to persuade the audience that the planet's harsh conditions are too intense for even high technology to withstand. He mentions, ""...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" This quote uses ethos to ensure the reliablity of the author, and to emphasize that scientists are truly struggling to develop devices that are well enough developed to explains the dangers. The understanding that technology made by scientists who have succesfully researched across the milky way cannot withstand Venus's circumstanes demonstrates how dangerous the planet is.

The use of statistics is presented by the author to take a more logical view on their argument to prove the dangers of Venus. The article mentions that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent blankets Venus."" As carbon dioxide is waste product of human respiration, the inhalation of this gas would be very dangerous for life to visit Venus. It also says that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Without shelter that can withold these extreme temperatures and amounts of pressure, the human body, similar to the spacecrafts, would be lucky to survive for more than a few hours. These numbers support the author's claim to focus on the horrific dangerous of exploring Venus to present a logical standpoint on this issue.

Throughout the article, it suggests that studying Venus is still a worthy mission for astronomers, however, the dangers that come along with these missions are extremely dangerous and life-threatening. The author mentions the curiosity that scientists have involving Earth's sister planet, and the desire to still visit Venus regardless of the harsh conditions. With the article's use of both previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics of Venus, the claim is very strongly supported with evidence.

Its would be amazing if NASA could get samples of the rock, gas, and other things on Venus. The reason it would be amazing is so that we can know how Venus is just like our earth they call Venus Eath's ""twin"" so it would be amzaing if they had a lot more in common. NASA is willing to send people there but the only problem is that it is to hot there for people to go there and land there and take samples.

FC4A76A05659,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The following topics the author used helped support this idea: the challenges, dangers, and the fasinations with Venus needs to be explored.

Our neighboring ""twin,"" that we can only observe by hovering far above it hopping to get as much detail as possible, creats a challenge due to how unsafe it is. Our scientists have ""sent numerous spacecrafts"" to Venus. But, each previous mission was unmanned because, no spacecraft survived the landing for mpore than a few hours. Also, due to the high pressures and heat on this planet there is ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on the surface.""

Due to the challenges, it makes it so much more dangerous. Since,

Venus is second to our sun and has an ""atmosphere of 97 precent carbon dioxide blanket"" and a tempeture average over 800 degrees Fahrinheit."" It makes it really hard for NASA to get a close look do to Venus's unsafe tempertures. Also, Venus has an ""atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what us humans experiance on our own plant."" Which is way ""more extreme than anything we have had to encounter."" Plus, if NASA were able to find away to float thirty-plus miles above the suface it ""would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit."" But, on the bright side ""it would have the air pressure close to at sea level on earth.""

But, despite these challenges and dangers there is plenty of fasinations with this planet. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Also, Venus still has some features similar to earth such as: valleys, mountains, and craters. Making more scientist to want to explore it to see if it was once habital by other creatures.

925BA9763402,"First, Venus is the closet planet to Earth by the size distance and density. Although the sun is very close to Earth, Venus is closer and is also the hottest. It has a temperature of over 800 degrees. Visiting this planet can be absolutely risky, but it could be worth it , because of the simple fact that it has not have had a visit in 3+ decades. From scientists view, it is very possible that Venus could have a planet like Earth.

On a second thought, this hot and dangerous planet is worthy to go be viewed , because this can possibly solve questions for people. The beneficial part of this comes in where maybe all these theories are true or false. The author tells us how postively this visit could be. The fact that a human can maybe land for longer than a few hours.

Furthermore, this planet could've and possibly currently be a planet like Earth, but because of the dangers going in could effect and reject people from entering. The similarities between Earth and Venus is the valleys and mountains. Both Earth and Venus have other rocky sediments that are similar too .

Venus is very dangerous for humans to step foot on and could not have spacecrafts to last more than a few hours due to the temperatures and atmospheric pressure. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author implies that exploring Venus is worth the risk by explaining the dangers and the motivation of human curiosity.

To understand Venus clearly, NASA wants to explore Venus on their own. They can either consider the exploration as a risk, or the exploration can be thought out as a challenge that people are willing to take despite the dangers. ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". Humans cannot undergo, let alone survive stepping foot on Venus with these extreme conditions. Earth's ""twin"" planet also has ""the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system"". Although there are many dangers to explore Venus, astronomers are fascinated by the idea that Venus has been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.

Human curiosity has motivated NASA to send other humans to study Venus. One way of doing so is by ""allowing scientists to float above the fray"". Floating above the fray would allow humans to avoid the harsh ground conditions. Miles away from the surface will still be ""170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth"". These conditions will not be easy, but will be survivable for humans. To contribute to the knowledge of Venus, researchers are are working on different task that will allow the machines to last long enough on Venus.

In conclusion, Venus presents a great amount of reasons that can be dangerous for humans to explore. Since Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Venus was probably covered with large oceans and could have supported many forms of life. Predictions like these cause people to want to meet the very end of imagination and innovation to finally see the true value of Venus to make the exploration a worthy pursuit.

The atmosphere of Venus consists of 97% carbon doxide, clouds of sulfuric acid, and the hottest surface temperetue of any planet orbitting the sun. Despite this, scientists have tried to send unmanned spacecrafts to the surface of Venus. Scientists think that Venus may have been the most earthlike planet, with the planets surface like valleys and mountains and possible evidence of oceans that may have existed long ago. The author believes that it is worthy to continue trying to explore Venus despite its dangers.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining the similarities that Venus has with the Earth and indicating that Venus is the closest planet to the Earth. In the text it states, ""...Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" This quote supports my claim because the author gives some evidence that Venus had some sort of body of water.

23C653E16CC8,"Venus is the second planet in the solar system from the sun that precedes Earth in the planetary order. This planet is often called Earth's ""twin"" and the ""Evening Star"" of the universe because of its brightness and relative similarity to the Earth. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author presents facts and figures that one could use to determine whether studying Venus would be an advantageous pursuit even though it would not be very safe. The author focuses more on the drawbacks of exploring Venus, hence the title of this work. The author does not strongly support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit due to his extensive reasearch on its toxic living conditions but does acknowledge the benefits of its accessibility from Earth.

Compared to Earth, the author has found that Venus in less less survivable for humans. In the early years of space industry, numerous spacecraft have embarked on missions to the planet, but they were not able to return home. Unlike Earth, Venus has an atmosphere that is ""almost 97percent carbon dioxide"" with a surface temperature averaging ""over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and an ""atmospheric pressure [that] is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(Paragraph 3). Due to these extreme differences in temperature, pressure, and air content, Venus would be fairly inhospitable for humans. Usually when NASA launches missions to other planets they are trying to find alternatives habitats for the human race in the event that they cannot survive on Earth. If humans will not be able to withstand the conditions of Venus it is no longer a good option; therefore, it is not worth looking into since the author provides evidence that Venus would not be a useful living environment in the future.

However, the author has also found that studying Venus could be beneficial considering its proximity and similar geographical features to Earth. The Earth comes right after Venus in the solar system, making it fairly close given the long time frame of space travel. Astronomers have discovered that it was also previoulsly one of the ""most Earth-like [planets]"" as it ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" (Paragraph 4). Venus also ""has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (Paragraph 4). In the event that Venus became a viable option for humans to inhabit when Earth collapses (as mentioned earlier), humans would have already been exposed to some of the landscape there. Although this would make Venus more assimilable, its similarity to Earth does not outweigh the dangers that still come with the planet being an unknown land changing from its previous state. With this evidence the author provides an advantage to exploring Venus, but it does not hold up against the established points about Venus' overall uninhabitability.

Throughtout the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author presents infomation for exploring Venus being both beneficial and harmful, but he elaborates more on the reasons pointing to the dangers that Venus poses. Compared to current conditions of Earth, Venus does not possess the necessary qualities that would make it a valuable reserve for potentially sustaining human life forms. The author is better able to address the disadvantages of studying Venus because of the extensive research revealing the planet's present volatile state instead of benefits from its similarity to Earth.

Venus is absolutely a planet that deserves a our attention. Why does it deserve our attention though; is it worth our time and money? If it was not worth all these risks, why would it be a topic of matter?

In the passage it states,"" Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot."" Many wondering minds think about all the possibilities of what could be on Venus and if it could be similar to Earth. Venus is our neighbor, or as paragraph 2 states,"" Earth's twin."" ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" If you had a brother or sister that close to you yet so far away wouldn't you want to find out about them?

Venus should be worth the exploration because there are so many possibilies of what could be on Venus. The passage states,"" Venus still has some features that are analogous to those close to Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sedient and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" As crazy as it sounds, there is a chance that the sediments from Venus, and other objects like rocks, are here on Earth too. I believe that we have scientists already working on the break down of what is in these objects and how they got here.

NASA workers have come up with the idea to send a hovering ship into orbit above Venus. Though the conditions are hard to work with, NASA has the capability to think of a way to let us receive information, pictures, and other objects from Venus. Towards the end of paragraph 5 it says, "" Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.""

NASA should first send a demo rover out to Venus,before you send our people out. We have already discovered the conditions, like the air, and surface, of Venus. See if there is another object of surprise that could pop out of no where. Make sure everyone is geared up and ready to go before sending our people out. Once we have determined all the conditions and maybe an element of surprise, send a highly trained, willing, person out there. Not on a long 36 day mission but just a simple few days to see what evidence and new opportunities that could arise on Venus.

The danger side is very important to look at as well before sending our people out there. Like the passage says, "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" This is one for the few risky obsticles NASA and its workers would have to overcome. Another example is, the temperature difference between the two planets. In paragraph 3 it states,"" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.""

The author supports this idea by giving examples as to how this exploration will expand our knowledge of our own planet and how it will advance space technology.

The first claim the author makes that supports the idea that studying Venus is worth it despite the risks is how alike Venus once was to Earth. In the second paragraph, it states, ¨Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.¨ In the fourth paragraph it states ¨Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth...¨ Studying these features that are found on Venus could greatly benefit the human race and their knowledge about our own planet and the solar system around us. Furthermore, since Venus can ¨sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit,¨ it is important to explore the planet as a possible way to expand the footprint of mankind.

The second claim made by the author that supports the suggestion is that exploring Venus will require an expansion of our technological capabilities when it comes to spacecrafts. In the fifth paragraph, the author states that since the conditons on Venus are so harsh, NASA wolud need to develop a new device that ¨would allow scientists to float above the fray.¨ Since something like this has yet to be developed, the exploration of Venus would require mankind to create new technology. In the sixth paragraph, it is stated that ¨many researchers are working on innovations that would allow machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus,¨ which further supports the point that the exploration of Venus will improve our technology.

Through the claims that exploring Venus will advance our knowledge and astronomical technology, it is clear that the author believes studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents.

The way he put everything into his own thoughts before just outting it out in the wolrd he had done a lot of reaserch about all of Venus and the planets.

I well enough think that he did a very good job at explaining everything about Venus and how the earth works. When the author states "" our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edge"" he is saying that even if there is danger in this world you shoudl never run away form it you should take a risk. The authour has some very good points on why you shouldnt be scared of this earth and all the new things happening with Venus and all the planets.

When the author was talking about the computers we should use on the planets and the new hovering saftly to the planets instead of taking rocket or a plan. That would be a good idea to try because with the hovering system you can get closer to the planets more than you can if you take a rocket or a plan all the way up there. It may not be as safe as taking a rocket up there because tou are more open being able to get hit by things up there. But with the new technology he is trying to use and to bring back that could honestly work becase the computers and tech that we are using today you cant take up there becasue there are no cell towers.

What the author is trying to do is a good idea and they way he explained everythung was super good to because he had so many reasons on what you could do to make it easier on everyone that has to go up in outter soace and work.

In the article it says, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" In this statement, the author brings up that traveling beyond Earth shouldn't be stopped by dangers that come along with doing so. In the third paragraph of the article, the author talks about Venus and its dangers that the author mentions, such as the temperature and atmosphere. In order for the author to say why they feel that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, they write about the issues first to get to their opinion on why they think it is worth exploring Venus, which has been done but not successfully for scientists to say wether or not that Venus could one day have life on it or not.

Once the author stated all the issues that there was and the complications, they talked about their opinion. Supporting their opinion, they wrote about what NASA was doing to be able to make visiting Venus one day almost possible. The author wrote about the inventions and ideas NASA had and put that into one whole paragraph, starting at paragraph 5, as their supporting evidence. NASA thought about the idea of floating above the surface at about 30 miles or so above the landscape as to not be on the hot surfcae of Venus. If scientists were to float above the surface of Venus to be at 170 degrees Fahrenheit instead of 800 degress Fahrenheit, it would make it impossible to gather data to take to analize so NASA came up with the idea of electronics made of silicon carbide and use mechanical compters from the 1800's.

Venus is often referred to as ¨Earth´s twin¨ , it is about the same size and density, and contains many geographical features that are found on Earth. Many of the gases on this planet can be found on Earth or even be breathed out of your own body (CO2). Venus has many similarities to the Earth we love, learning as much as possible about Venus can help us in the long term. In the text the author talks of how Venus is right around the corner from us and how scientists are trying to build a spacecraft that will be able to withstand the tempretures of the hostile planet. If we humans can acsess information of the planet, when our ozone layer is completly perferated we may be able to switch planets for better living conditions.

C22DE6DEF6B5,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author claims that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. He provides many details over why travelling to Venus is such a challenge. However, he does not support his claim well because he does not give enough reasons as to why it would worth it to go there.

The second part of his claim has a lot of evidence for it. In the third paragraph, he details many of the dangers faced by anyone wishing to go to Venus. ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. [...] temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet [...] such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" This description is filled with details that cause readers to be understandably adverse to the thought of travelling to a planet with these conditions. This imagery fully supports how studying Venus would be deadly.

Despite this, the author does not do much to explain why studying Venus is worth the risk. In the fourth paragraph he claims that the reason why scientists are discussing further visits is because ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" The second piece of evidence he provides is that ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit,"" alluding to the second paragraph, where he explained that Earth, Venus, and Mars all orbit the sun at different speeds, causing them to vary in the distances they are from each other. The facts that Venus is a little bit like Earth and that it is one of two planets that are near to Earth sometimes do not cause readers to feel like a trip to Venus is justified, because these do not seem like good enough reasons to brave the dangers. These are the only two justifications the author offers before labeling the value of returning to Venus as ""indisputable."" Compared to the huge amount of challenges in the paragraph before, readers do not feel the same way. The author then goes on to explain how NASA would send people to Venus, which does not support the claim at all.

Then they tell in full detail how we could possibly vist Venus safely. These few key details help the author build and support the suggested idea that we should vist Venus.

First we must know that going to Venus will not be easy for humans to do. In the text the author writes,""A thick Atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highy corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

This further proves that Venus is going to be a serious challenge for man kind to vist because of the crazy condtions humans will have to face.

In order to vist venus safely we need to be able to plan a way to survive Venus's extreme conditions. In the text the author provides examples of how humans will do so such as,""The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our Jet airplains travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying out of their way."" This futher proves that traveling to Venus in the furture is possible. Also that scientists are coming up with ways on how we can safely get to Venus's surface.

In the text the author writes,""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further vists to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This point further proves that Venus is a place humans should want to explore because it could hold answers for Earths begginings and how it might end. Also Venus could hold secrets about our universes beggining and end.

In this article, the author suggests studying Venus as a worthy pursuit. The risks, advancing technology, and benefits of studying Venus in this article, prove how well the author support's their idea.

Venus has shown to be a quite abrasive planet. It's risks have detered many scientists from studying it, but for good reason. Venus presents many challenges such as volcanoes, earthquakes, and lighting strikes. In the article, the author explains how overall temperature exceeds 800 degrees farenheit, and a pressure 90 times greater of our own planet would make entering the planets atmosphere almost impossible, and staying long enough to gather any data out of the question.

Although the risks of Venus seem to out weigh any possible benefits, the author presents possible solutions to many of these problems. With Venus's atmosphere being hostile, it would make landing and gathering data on the planet impossible. However, the author presents NASA's solution of a blimp like vehicle that could stay above the threatening atmosphere. Although conditions would be difficult to sustain, the air pressure and temperature would be liveable for humans. The author also adds the idea of using mechanical computers. These old pieces of technology would allow humans to make calculations, without having to worry about harsh conditions as much.

Venus may be dangerous, but exploring and studying it may provide more benefits that compensate for the risks and dangers.

We have tried to explore Venus multiple times but the explorations have been un named because after a few our the spacecrafts broke or quit on us.

8B4643E8E725,"Venus the Hardest Planet to Explore

Venus is the hardest planet to explore because the ships only last a few hours on Venus,it has high tempertaures than Mercury even though Mercury is closer,and its weather conditions and atmosphere are bad compared to ours.

First, reason why Venus is hard to explore is because that the spacecrafts can only stay for a few hours. Since the planets have different orbitational speeds sometimes Earth and Venus are closer in some ways. So humans decided to send spacecrafts over to explore .There were a few previous missions that were unmanned. Not one spaceship has survived the landing. So for more than three decades there has not been one spaceship that has touched down on Venus for that specific reason.

Second reason is that Venus's temperatures are very high in scale. Even though Mercury is the closest to the sun Venus's temperatue is still higher. Venus's temperature can reach up to 800 degrees fahrenheit. which is 90 times greater than Earth's temperature. Even the deepst parts of Earth's ocean can liquefy any metals. So putting a submarine in the deepest parts of our ocean can damage the metals around it.

Finally thr third reason is that Venus's weather conditions and atmosphere are dangerously bad. On Venus there are many powerful earthquakes, frequent lightning stikes, and erupting volcanoes. The atmoshere contains 97% of carbon dioxide blankets. That being said humans wouldn't be able to live on Venus.

At least that is what the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" claims. Throughout the article, the author supports and enforces the idea that Venus' exploration involves many challenges, but scarcely explains the benefits of exploring it and consequently why it is worthy of pursuit despite the dangers.

The author firsts opens with several facts about Venus to instill a feeling of doubt within the reader. Through this, he leads into the main idea of the article by abruptly asking the question, ""If your sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" After a doubtful introduction, the author provides arguments of the benefits of returning to this hot, dense world. This was a crucial addition to the article that shows his consideration of uninformed readers by first explaining why Venus is so difficult to explore before beginning his first argument of the benefits of exploring Venus.

He promptly answers the question by again giving several facts about the history of Venus. The inherent nature of the first fact ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" stirs the reader's curiosity, prompting the author to ask the next question to lead into his following argument. This paragraph serves to hook the reader's by giving relatively surprising facts about Venus that consequently describes the appeal for scientists to study such a planet.

After hooking the reader, the author should go in-depth about how Venus' similarities with Earth make it a valuable target for further research and exploration, but instead, he abruptly begins his next argument about the challenges of exploring Venus. Although the main idea of this article is the difficulties of exploring Venus, the author only addresses the value of exploring it in paragraphs four and eight. The rest of the paragraphs are dedicated to giving possible solutions to the impending goal of exploring the planet; however, he does not follow up on paragraph four's message that does not wholly explain the benefits of exploring Venus. At most, the author makes an argument that Venus is ripe for exploration because of its past similarities with Earth, but he does not explain why. Moreover, he introduces his next argument in paragraph five by making the dogmatic claim that ""the value of returning to Venus seems indisputable"" in paragraph four.

He nevertheless makes an arguably untenable argument about the dangers and difficulties of exploring Venus, but fails to support the idea that exploring it has value.

Having a vehicle stay out of the high pressure, high temperature area could be a safe alternative to explore Venus.

The only issue with it would be that peering out of a ship can only provide the scietists with limited information on the ground conditions.

NASA is very creative and has started creating electronics made of silicon carbide so they can withstand Venus's conditions.

For example, in the story it states,"" some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" The spacecrafts that were previously sent there only lasted hours, so NASA is making improvements.

Hopefully, NASA can continue on this road to improving and one day get humans to Venus safely.

""Curiosity killed the cat"" is a famous saying.

If we do not explore Venus now, human curiosity will lead us to many equally or more dangerous things.

The author supports their idea very well and makes multiple vaild points explaining why we should become a little more creative so we can explore Venus now. There would no longer be any curosity about it, making it safer.  ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

Earth and Venus are some what alike doesn't mean we can go and do some teast on there. Even thought it has some of the same features as Eath. Venus is still not the same.

D3F5EB7E53C6,"Exploring Venus might seem dangerous for some people, but others believe Venus is a worthy puruit despite the dangers it presents. In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author supports the main idea of the article which is ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". There are many ways he supports his main idea, Three in which are very interesting.

First, Venus has many Earth-like features that might make it seem that life used to exist on Venus. For example in paragraph 4, the author says, ""long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". He also says, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as vallys, mountains, and craters"". This is important because we could find lots of information about living organisms on Venus. These two quotes also help us understand why its important to explore Venus no matter how dangerous it may seem.

Second, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. The researchers would have to get close to Venus in order to get valuable information. In paragraph 6 the author says, ""Scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges"". This quote helps uderstand that in order to get valuable information of Venus, we have to take risks and learn how to overcome challenges. If we graduly keep working on how to overcome challenges, we can infer that it might be easier to go to Venus and get valuable information despite the risks.

Lastly, humans curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Paragraph 8 says, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". This quote helps us understand that it is a worthy pursuit to explore Venus despite the dangers because it is important for us to expand the very edges of immagination and innovation. Although curiosity may lead to great challenges, it is important for us to overcome them.

In conclusion, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He also uses three supporting details. First, Venus has many Earth-like features that might make it seem that life used to exist on Venus. Second, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Lastly, humans curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

It sparks scientists to Venus, due to the similarities it has to Earth, as is to why scientists are interested on reserching this planet in space. The conditions are far more extreme than anything scientists encounter on Earth due to the stability of the atmospheric pressure and temperature that could crush practically anything. Venus is worthy to pursuit because in paragraph four, it reads, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This explains to the reader to why it is important to be discovered despite all of the challenges on the surface.

""Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" (paragraph 8) Despite everything that makes us humans limited to encounter the curiosity of Venus, it shall not be intimidating to expand the edges of knowledege when humans can work around it to find safe solutions.

DF3EAEF0CA37,"In the passage, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that, studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Some of the reasons the author staes that venus is dangerous is because, the clouds have a highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere, the surface's temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit while the, atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we are used to on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Adding onto that there are, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and freuqent lightning strikes. Venus is actualkly a lot like Earth with its, volcanoes, density and size.

Despite The planet's dangers, Venus is a very interesting planet with many things that astronomers are astonishes by. They believe long ago, that venus was like earth by a lot. They also believe that venus was covered with oceans and could have supported tons of forms of life just like planet, Earth. Even today,Venus has feature that are very similiar to Earth's. One of the biggest reasons for wanting to find out more about Venus in a serious note is for a planetary visit, if the time were to ever come. A lot of scientists and astronomers are very intrigued into the idea of exploring Venus even more. NASA has one idea for sending humans to study venus. They want to scientists float above the surface of Venus in some sort of blimp-like vehicle.

I believe that we should explore venus, i would love to know more about Venus. It's always fun learning about things that you never knew, which a lot of people like the astronomers and scientists. I think that exploring and studying Venus is very dangeous consdering the surface tempersature and the risky weather. I think that NASA would have their best astronauts be prepared and safe at all times. We dont know all the possibilties of what could happen while a visit at Venus, but if we ever do get to explore Venus we should be prepared with the best technology. I don't know if studying Venus is the most important thing scientists and astronomers are worried about, but at one point it would be great if they took it to another level.

The author stated many reasons on why he thought they should study Venus no matter what the dangers or conditons are on the planet. I think it would be good to explore and study Venus because it was stated to be very similar to how Earth is now.

The author stated Venus is offten referred to as Earth's ""twin"", and that it is sometimes one of the closest planets to Earth besides Mars. Venus is also called the ""Evening Star"", because sometime you can see it from Earth. The tempatures on Earth and Venus are very differant, although the author thinks that at one point, Venus could of had living people, oceans, and could of been very close to how Earth is now. Venus still has features that make it similar to Earth.

Venus now has a differant atmosphere. The atsmosphere is thicker and 97 percent carbon dioxide. NASA has tried to study Venus in the past, but no space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours. NASA has not tried to take any kind of space craft to Venus for more than 3 decades. On Venus, the surface averages over 800 degrees fahrenheit. The conditions are for more extreme. Venus has the hottest suface temperature of any other planet.

NASA eventually wants to send people to Venus, although they would not be able to touch the surface. They would float about 30 miles above the surface, similar to a jet airplane. Although through pictures they would not be able to know how the surface is, I think they still need to study Venus.

The secound way is that in the article the author says, ""Probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life.""

This furthermore explains how the aurthor explains his thoughts.

Venus is not hospitable for many different reasons. The first reason is that Venus is 97% carbon dioxide. The second reason is that Venus itself can reach up to 800 degress Fahrenheit. Another reason Venus is not hospitable is becuase the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth. Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in our solar system. The final reason Venus is not hospitable is that there are clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid making it impossible to live on Venus.

Although there are many reasons why Venus is not hospitable NASA might have found a slolution. In the article it says that NASA could maybe make a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.""

When it comes down to it the aurthor as you can tell heavily supports the thought of traveling to Venus. I support It also because it never hurts to learn new things about someone or something, but I think the thing that is stopping us is the cost that it takes to send something up there and there is no point to just send someone up there to die.

While traveling to Venus sounds like a really cool to do sometime down the future right now and I know we don't have the money to support a trip that far away even if its supposed to be close by.

Another thing that the author did to support that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is the facts he gives about how similar Venus is from Earth. In the passage it says ""Venus was probably covered largely with ocens and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" the passage also says ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.""

In conclution the auhor suggestions that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is well explained because the author used information from scientists, astronomers, and the NASA. The author also used the thoughts from these knowledable people to support his idea. The author supports his ideas by adding information that gives his idea truth and validity. The author also adds some facts that go against his idea such as explaining why Venus is such a dangerous place. All of the author's work balences out to make his idea understandabe and thoughtful.

Exploring Venus it can be dangerous because of it's temperature and because of what can happen to you.

Exploring Venus can be worthy bacuse scientist say that it well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have suppported various formsof life, just like Earth."" Venus it can also be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. But it can be a little dangerous because Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in our solar system. One of the challenges Venus has are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

The average of the temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric preassure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Venus has some features that are analogous to those on Earth, it has rocky sediment and inludes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Scientis belive that Venus could have been once a planet where people could live. Scientist also say that Venus could be dangerous in some ways because of it's temperatures.

In the chalange of exploring Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" it can be nother planet where humans can live. But venaus can be dangerous, but it also has alot of features like Earth. The temperatures for venus are a little dangerous, because venus is one of the hottest planets in our solar system. NASA it's also working on other approaches to studying Venus.

66ABB3042298,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" believes that studying Venus is something that should be done even though it can be very dangerous. The author gives multiple reasons to why we should explore the planet, or learn more about it. However, some people think the dangers of Venus outweigh the benefits of pursuing research on it. The author supports the idea of studying Venus even though it can be very dangerous. He provides many details, and facts as to why it's a good idea.

First off, the author tells what Venus is like. He states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"". This is because Venus and Earth are close in size, density, and at some points in orbit are the closest planets in the solar system. It is also believed that at one point, Venus was a lot like Earth is now. ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our soloar system."". The article goes on to say Venus most likely had large oceans that supported life, and the planet has things like craters, valleys, and mountains that we also have here on Earth. The author including these details helps get the point across that Venus is a lot like Earth, and with the little research been done already, we've found so much. This helps readers understand that the longer Venus is studied, the more we will learn about it.

Next, the author gives possible ways to study Venus safely, and effciently. The author states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."". Stating ways that Venus can be studied with people not being put in danger helps get the authors point across. The article also touches on how floating above the surface could keep those studying the planet safe. Temperatures would still be high, but nothing the spacecraft couldn't handle, the air pressure would be like how it is on Earth at sea level, soloar power would be bountiful, and radiation would be no higher than the levels on Earth. The text then states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."". Although this would not be an easy job, it is possible to study Venus safely. The details used in this paragraph help convey the authors point that studying Venus can be done safely and that it should continue to happen.

Last, the author gives more ways Venus can be studied safely using different technology. While talking about different approaches to studying Venus the author states, ""...simplified electronics...have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks..."". This quote also helps the reader understand that studying Venus can be done in a safe and harmless way. Using this new technology could help research on Venus advance, and keep those doing the research out of harm's way. The author then goes on to talk about a different technology that was used in World War 2 that can also be used as a new method to study Venus. These are called mechanical computers, and they use gears and levers rather than the electronics that actual computers use. The mechanical computers are made of mechanical parts which are stronger, so they shouldn't be damaged as easily. These are just a few of the ways technology can help safely advance the study of Venus.

In conclusion, it is important Venus is continued to be studied and researched. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does a great job of conveying to his audience why studying Venus is important even though it is dangerous. In the last paragraph, the author says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value..."". Studying Venus can help advance many things, and our knowledge of other planets could grow from this as well. There have been many safe ways found to study Venus, so it should be done. The author also states that, ""Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts..."". This quote also shows that the author believes the study of Venus should continue even though it can be dangerous. If we didn't study things just because they're dangerous, then we would have nothing dicovered. The author of this article believes the study of Venus should continue, and does very well at conveying that by telling the audience Earth and Venus are a lot alike, gives new, safer ways to study Venus, and gives examples of technology that could also make the study of Venus a lot safer and easier.",6,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,1.0
392F93BC6499,"The ""Evening Star"" or otherwise known as Venus is a very dangerous planet. Despite the planet being close to us, we haven't sent any spacecrafts there in the past 30 years. The reason has alot to do with the fact that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide covers Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuss atmosphere.

On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which means that its alot of times hotter than the surface of our planet. The atmospheric pressure is also 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.

With all that being said, why would we want to go back there.

The reason is because Astronomers think that the Venus was once an earth like planet. They believe that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Adding more into this is that today, Venus has some features such as mountains and valleys.

NASA has come up with an idea on how they would live in

Venus safely and productive. The idea is to allow scientist to float above ground. About 30 miles to be exact. With them hovering 30 miles above ground they should be safe from the ground conditions. With that, NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus; such as an device that was used in World War 2 that calculates under high pressure of heat and does not require electricity.

I love the idea of going back to Venus and exploring because we are humans and we have an unlimited imagination. If we want to truly be a civilization, We should be at least a two planet species. Innovating and learning is how we got here. 100 years ago we made the first car. Imagine what life wil be like in 100 years.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2

5573EE238712,"Did you know Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin""? Venus is the closest planet to Earth in size and it is also one of the closest planets to us in distance. However, we haven't been able to explore Venus because of its hostile environment. Venus is a challenging planet for humans to study even though it close prximity to us. Exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is our nearest option for a planetary visit, it would further our knowledge of the planet, and it would help us prepare for the furure.

First, exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit is it is our nearest option for a planetary visit. It is the closest planet to Earth in density and in size. In the text it states, ""It may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This shows that Venus may have been a hospitable planet a long time ago. If scientist could explore Venus they could find evidence that Venus was once like Earth.

Second, we should explore Venus is it would further our knowledge of the planet. Venus is one of the closest planets to us yet we do not know much about it. The article states, ""Scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" This means even though there are risks to exploring Venus it would be a worthy pursuit because we would learn more to understand Venus. Despite the dangers of going to Venus it would help scientist learn more about why Venus is so inhospitable.

Finally, studying Venus would be a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because it would help us prepare for the furure. Gaining insight on Venus would be a challenage due to it harsh environment, but the challenge could push our limits. It cause us to create a new way of getting through the harshest of environments. The author states, ""The insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This shows us that creating a way to explore Venus now will likely help us to explore something with just as much challenge in the furture. Exporing Venus has dangers but it could help prepare for the furture.

In conclusion, exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is our nearest option for a planetary visit, it would further our knowledge of the planet, and it would help us prepare for the furure. Venus is one of the closest planets to us we should explore it and learn more about it. It could have been very similar to Earth a long time ago but why is it so inhospitable now.

The author even stated that "" More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"", which could means when we every get close to get sample could be a incredible achivement.

The author support on studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, is by claiming venus could possibly have been like earth with oceans. The passage states that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.""The passage also states that ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.""Knowing these details it can provide a reason why we should go to Venus to learn about if there was forms of life or bodies of water long ago.

He says "" A thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"". This is one reason it would be very hard to explore Veuns. Also becuase on the surface of Venuse the temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit.""the pressure is 90 times grater than what we experience on our own planet"". This is saying that this enviroment would crush a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans on earth.

So that's why people studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Here're some evidences regarding why the people still to explore it. For instance: Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation ( Paragraph 8).

A ""blimp-like"" vehicle hovering 30 or so miles would help avoid the unfriendly ground conditions . At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. So not easy conditions, but survivable enough for humans. So this would help make the mission capeable of completing.

He also mentions how peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penertrate the dense atmosphere making it hard to take photographs . They also cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author supports his or her idea well and has many examples to back himself up. The author talks about the similarites Venus has to Earth, the dangers of Venus, and what scientists are doing to make going to Venus a possibility.

Despite the dangers of studing Venus, there are many reasons why it is a worthy pursuit. The author states in the article,""Often reffered to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" This shows that even though Venus is dangerous, there are similarites that make it worth while to study, if that means one day having another planet similar to Earth.

In the article, there are many dangers of Venus. According to the text, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" This shows the challenges of studying Venus because the percent of carbon dioxide and high corrosive sulfuric acid are too much for humans or even some spacecrafts. Another danger is the temperature. Venus averages a surface temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. That is beyond temperatures at which we humans can withstand. To show the severity of the atmospheric pressure, the author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" These dangers may seem like it isn't a worthy pursuit but the author goes on to describe just why and how scientist should pursue Venus. The article states that long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. To add on to that, today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. This is a good example to support that the author supports his or her claim because it is describing what was and is still good about Venus. The top example that supports the authors claim is what the scientists have already done to begin the search of Venus. According to the article, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" This supports the author's claim because despite the dangers of Venus, the scientists have found a way to study Venus at a more suitable, safer way. Maybe not as efficient, but it saves the lives of the astronaunts.

In conclusion, the author supports his or her claim well because of all the evidence and examples that are used in the text. Stating the similarites of Earth show that it is worth while to study Venus when the outcome could possibly be a planet that is like a second Earth. Describing the dangers of Venus but then talking about how the scientists can get around those dangers supports the author's claim because the readers see that even though Venus is dangerous, there are still valuable ways to study it, meaning that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
7094F2B10D77,"I strongly agree the auther did a great job , on supporting his idea on the suggesten of studing venus is worth a shot , despit the dangers it presents . the resaon i agree with him is becuse he has great supporting details .

The reason i think he did a good job supporting his claim is because not just did he tell us intersting facts but he also gave us a bit of back round like it's name and so forth . The most important infomashion i think the author gave was talking about the atmosphere .""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide ."" found in paragraph 3 . Also telling us about the planet surface temperature and going realy indep "" on the planet's suface ,temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit , and the atomospheric pressure is 90 times greater then what we experence on our own planet "". ""beyond high pressure and heat "" .

This is why i strongly support the auther on supporting his claim on the suggesten on the stupping venus will be a great idea anad also open up new doors .",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
2AF0D4565FBC,"Have you ever thought there was a possiblity of going to venus? Yeah i didnt either but i completly agree with the autors point of view on this article i agree about going to venus for more information cause it would help us understand what happened to venus and if one point and time it was like earth.

The challenge of going to venus with anything is its massive air pressure, solfuric acid rain, and really hot surface temptures and we currently dont have anything to actually be able to survive those condtions for more then maybe three weeks or less so what i say we do is that we look at metals that are restiant to stuff like that and see if we could try combining the atoms to make an alloy.

In conclusion in my personal opionion i think yes we should try a little harder to get to know more about venus cause it would explain a kot and tell us if one day it was like earth and what happened to it so we could avoid it so that doesnt happen to earth and on top of that the more we learn about it the more the possiblity of it maybe becoming a hospital planet to go to if we need to ever move off of earth.

1B976DF43007,"In the Challenge of the Exploring Venus, the auther suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers I think he I right, but i think that the dangers are to much to risk. In the story the auther calls venus the ''Evening Star'' and said that it was one of the brightest points in the the sky,but it also said ''while venus is simple to see from a good distance, but safe vantage point from eath.'' I think what that means is that, you can't get close to venus because it's too dangerus.

Some of the ways that venus is too dangerus to go to is because we know what will happy if we go. We sent things up befor and each previous mission was unmanned but for good reason, since not one spacecraft survied the landing for more then maybe a few hours. Thats when we saw the issue and stoped sending up sacescrafts. Not one spaceship has touched down on venus in more that three decades.

A thick atmospehere of 97% carbon dioxide covers venus, also to add to that theres even more difficulit clouds of highly corrosive sulfric acid on venus. On the the planet the conditions arfe far more extreme then anything humans encoouter on earth or anywhere so far. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we have on earth. besides high presurs and unbareable heats, the weather is bad too. Erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquackes, and very frequent lighting strikes.

In the end, our travels on earth and farther should'nt be limitted but at the same time we are facesed with dangers and things we sould strive to do better in but we should do our best to look at the word without getting to close to danger.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2

But most people believe that venus might have bee covered in oceans at one point and could of had many different life froms on its planet.

The author is trying to say that if we continue our studying on venus and if we land more spaceships on venus we might be able to find out if oe day we could live there or if one day we could send men and women up there to find out if there was some sort of life forms and if the planet once held many differnet stuff that we didnt know that existed.

The author also informed us, readers that venus has the hottest surface temperatures of any planet in our solar system. astronomers are also discussing if venus could in habit more life forms if they figure out what could be worn or if life forms could live on venus.

44D73D95E310,the author suggests that studying venus is worthy pursuit despite the danger. i think he did good on support the story abouts why it worthy but it might not be worthy it might just be that all the spaceship they was using or the stuff on the ship making it not able to make it all the way up there they could be making the spaceship to havey or they need to study somewhere else first just to see if the ship the reason why the cant make it there and back. i think they should try a new ship or try to make it to somewhere else before trying to make it over there try somewhere closer so than maybe you find out how to get there or mybad get close to get to there that just how i see it if you say it worthy than try a diffent plant just to see if it easy to find out how to get to that plant you been talking about that why when u pull up all the reseach you can say as i was reach i find two way to get to the plant and they gone say how u find all of that to go with that and say when u find stuff you can get stuff from it.,1,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.0
E3FF6BE3235A,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. For years and years NASA has been trying to study Venus and despite their pursuits they have failed because of the risks that have occured. Venus should still be studied despite the dangers it presents because one day when Earth becomes overpopulated Venus could possibly be our only option due to how similar the planets are, our travels should go beyond Earth, and although it is dangerous it still needs to be studied.

Years from now Earth will become overpopulated and might be inhapitable; therefore, Venus could be our only option. In the article it says that, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet has a surface of rockky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetay visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" Venus should still be studied due to how similar it is to Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy condtions, but survivable for humans.

Our travels must go beyond Earth;although, it has been challenging to study Venus, there will always be risks that come along with studying new things; such as, the planets in our solar system. In the text it states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has no value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us. There has been numerous spacecraft sent to land on this cloud-draped world. Although each previous mission was unmanned and no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours does not mean that Venus should no longer be studied. Any planet will have their own dangers, causing there to be obsticles in our path of researching a potential, habitable planet.

Studying Venus will come will dangers and risks; but, our planet got this far because the people in it never gave up on pursuing a new study even if it had dangers of it's own. Venus should still be studied because our travels should go beyond earth regardless of the dangers, one day Earth won't be habitable and it's sister planet will be our only option, and new studies will come with their dangers they still need to be studied.

F73047E4DC36,"I think the auther is being very un biased about wether or not we should go to venus. It can be riducolusly dangorous and will kill anyone that steps foot on venus. They talk about how Venus is hotter then Mercery which si the planet closest to the sun. Venus is hotter because of the pressure and dnesity that the atomoshere carries.

Also the fact that the pressure is so bad that if you but a submerne on Venus it would instantly liquafy as if it was nothing. That makes a great deal when trying to get there. Id otn doubt that anyone is not finding out the mos that they can when going to venus but I dint really think it would be a great idea sense there isnt much chance of survival. Going to Mars sound my relable to me. The idea of hovering over venus would make much more sense do to the fact that anyone who steps foot on Venus would most likley die. But there must be tons of risks to even just hovering over the planet.

I do belive that we should study venus but i dont think we should do it at the expensie of peoples lives. Maybe we could invent a high tech rover ot explore the outside of venus.

The Author states that Venus was once like planet earth, That it held Oceans, Mountains, and Craters. According to The Challenge of Exploing Venus, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 4). In other words Venus held some sort of life at some bpoint it also had water which could help us if one day our Earth comes to and end.

According to The Challenge of Exploring Venus, ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel""(The Challenge of Exloring Venus 4).

According to The Challenge of Exploring Venus, ""some simplified technology made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted three weeks in such conditions"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This means that we eventually would be able to visit Venus's surface without dying within a few hours, which woud help us learn way more about teh planet.

Venus could be our nearest option for planitary visit. There is Earth like qualities but, it is very dangerious. Scientist still study this world because they know that if they could have a landing that was successful then they could finaly really start to explore the suface.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth. At times we may be closer to Mars do to the speed at wich the planets spin but we are usually closest to Venus. Many spacecraft have been sent to Venus trying to learn more of it but each time that it has been attempted, it has only been able to last a few hours before failing. Venus is a challenging planet to be studied.

Venus has many issues but there is profe that there may have once, long ago, been covered with oceans and had plenty of adaptable life on it. Today there are still some places on Venus that have Earth like features. Land forms that look the way Earth's do. There are valleys, moutains, and craders.

Though it is true that Venus is closest to us and may be the best otpion for visitation one day in the future it still has many problems. The planets surface area is an avaerage of 800 degrees Farenhheit. The atomic pressure is 90 times as much as Earth. At this point in time Venus is enhabital. There must be more reasearch allowed on Venus to find out if anyone could ever step foot on it.

Venus must be researched more to learn as much as possable if it is said that it is the most livable planet. It has many dangers, yes, but that is the vary reason it needs more attention.

1D917FDFADF7,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus' The auther says that stdying Venus is a worthy persuit despite all the dangers because it is Earth's ""twin"". Venus is the planet next to Earth and sometimes it is the closest to Earth. Mars, Venus, and Earth all orbut the sun at different speeds so there are times when Mars is closer to Earth and other times when Venus is closer. Venus is similar in size and density to Earth.

There are signs that show there once was life on Venus. These include features of rocky sediment such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Our nearest option for a planetary visit is Venus because of all of its features. The atmosphere of Venus is different than ours because it is very hot. If scientists want to be able to visit Venus they would have to hover about 30 miles over the surface to avoid the dangers of the ground. The air pressure is close to the sea level of Earth, it is not easy conditions but it is survivable. The atmosphere is so dense so the forms of light are limited.

So in conclusion, studying Venus is dangerous but a good idea. Venus has many characteristics of Earth and shows clues that there was once life on Venus. There's also dangers to studying Venus because the atmosphere is different than Earth and not what we are used to. I think we should continue to study Venus considering the similarites to Earth.

E7276788F5CF,"The author suggest that studying Venus is worthy pursuit the dangers it presents. The author thinks that it's worth exploring Venus no matter the dangerous a human may go through. The author did not so good in explaining his opinion. He mentions only cons through out mayority of the article.

First the author mentions that Venus is Earth's twin closest plant in term of density and sizes and closest to distance too. But this hasn't been much of help, the fact that none spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours. Secondly Venus is covered in a thick atmospher of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide making it hard for us to see through a spacecraft camera. Then on Venus suface temperatures are around 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric perssure is 90 times greater than Earth's. The conditions on Venus are more far extreme than what a human can experiance on Earth. NASA has tried serval ways to study Venus, for example peering at Venus from hovering safetly far above the plantet can provide limited insight on ground conditions because the light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere. Exploring Venus is a challengeing planet for humans to study.

In my opinion this article does not explain why it's worth studying Venus no matter the risks. The author just talked about all the cons Venus has, the diffculties, the conditions of weather and all kinds of dangerous Venus provides. This just makes us think that just maybe it's not worth risking yourself having in mind this mission might fail as well. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
AF66DEECF5A6,"Scientists have been studying Venus for generations, wondering what could possibly be on a planet so close to ours. Now that we don't have to wonder anymore, NASA will try to take it one step higher. They want to be as close to Venus' ground as possible, without dying.

Their plans are to use a blimp-like vehicle that will withstand the great amount of pressure and heat. It will fly thirty miles above the Venusian landscape, avoiding any ground conditions that would do them harm. It would still be 170 degrees F., but they would have an abundance of solar energy, and the radiation woud not exceed Earth levels.

However, in order to learn all there is about Venus, you would have to go onto Venus. This is almost an impossible task though. There are many dangers on Venus, including sulfuric acid rain and an atmosphere of nintey seven percent carbon dioxide. Hovering over it would be useless. In paragraph six, it states, ""... peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" This states that by hovering on top of the planet, they can't learn anyting they don't already know.

My honest oppinion on this topic is that we should not be exploring Venus right now. We just don't have the right technology for it right now. We need to wait however many years before we can officially explore our sister planet. Trying to figure out its secrets now would just be a waste of time, money, and possibly lives. We shouldn't risk a human being just because this planet used to be like ours millions of years ago. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
DF554AD625EA,"Did you know that the planet Venus has a lot of Earth like similarities? Well in the story ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports this idea giving factual evidence one being,Venus is somewhat referred to as Earths ""twin"", Venus has a dangerous climate and dosen't have the resources needed for our living conditions, and Not a single spaceship has been to Venus in more than three decades.

First of all, Venus is somewhat referred to as Earth's ""twin"". In paragraph two the author explains one way of how Venus and Earth are the same. The author states "" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in distance too."" In this way the author is implying the physical features are similar. The author also states that "" Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to Earth. Like Mountains, rocky sediment, and even valleys."" Even though Venus has the same physical features as Earth its not the same as the things we need in order to live.

In addition, Venus has a dangerous climate and dosen't have the resources needed for our living conditions. In paragraph three the author gives a description of the conditions on Venus. The author states that "" A thick atmosphere of almost ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" This here states that if humans were to travel to Venus they would not be able to survive because Venus's atmosphere is different from Earth. Not only that but the author also states that "" On the planet's surface, tmeperatures average over eight-hundred degrees Farenheit."" With that being said these living conditions are to extreme for humans to encounter because the pressure is ninety times greater than what humans expeirence on our own planet.

Finally, Not a single spaceship has been to Venus in more than three decades. In the text it says ""Such an enviornment would liquify an metals"" With this being said everybody know spaceships are made of metal and that is why no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. The text also states that "" Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation of being a challenging planet for humans to study,despite its proximity to us."" In the end scientists are working to find better ways to advance in their technology and spacecraft to be able to continue their journey on Venus.

In conclusion the author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Because Venus is somewhat referred to as Earths ""twin"", Venus has a dangerous climate and dosen't have the resources needed for our living conditions, and Not a single spaceship has been to Venus in more than three decades. With these pieces of supporting evidence this explains the authors purpose in explaining why Venus is a worthy pursuit despit the dangers it presents.        ",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
BCE83D08D2D5,"In the article, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. The author explains why throughout the article, and tries to persuade readers into thinking that Venus is a planet we should not give up on. But the question still remains, why are scientist still researching this planet if it's so dangerous?

In paragraph one, the author explains that Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. This may bring an interest to astronomers and stargazers that enjoy studying and watching the sky at night. This may be a worthy cause for some people to continue studying Venus. In paragraph two, the author explains how Venus is sometimes referred to as ""Earth's twin"". Venus is almost the same size and density of Earth and it also close in distance. Some people may find this interesting because people on Earth are always looking for other forms of life and other places to go besides Earth. If Venus is like Earth, in physical and other ways, there may be life on Venus that we haven't discovered yet.

One of the most important things to know is that Venus once could have been the most Earth-like planet in the entire solar system. I believe that this information is very important and more people should keep studying that. In paragraph four it says that Venus ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" If it held life back then, why wouldn't it now? If Venus was once like Earth why couldn't Earth be like Venus now? Some people may worry that Earth will turn out like Venus, with high temperatures and crazy atmospheric pressures. If scientists and astronomers find more information about this planet, we could have almost every answer we need for all our questions.

Traveling to Venus is a very difficult and dangerous process. In the article the author states that NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has an idea for sending people from Earth to study the planet, Venus. They are trying to create a vehicle that hovers the planet instead of going directly on the surface of Venus. NASA is also working on different methods of studying Venus besides the hovering vehicles. They made some ""simplified electronics made of silicon carbide,"" and they have been tested in a lab. If they are able to find a way to Venus, they will be able to find out so much more information about it.

They also went back and are trying an old techology called ""mechanical computers."" The mechanical computers were used in the 1940s during World War ll. I believe that using old technology may be a good thing for some people and a positive thing to look at. Some people look at technology nowadays and believe it is a bad thing, but if we are using older technology from a different generation people might think different of it. Also, as stated in the article, modern technology is very quick and efficient, but do not come to much use in extreme conditions. For example, if you put a modern day cellphone or laptop in a very hot condition , it will most likely melt because of the material used to make it. If we used older technology, the technology would be made by different materials and could come more in handy.

I think this may be another reason to keep exploring Venus because you could create so much technology and invent ways to go to Venus succcessfully. You could also find new ways to explore other planets and go to other planets. Creating this technology would lead to many great discoveries about our planets and our solar system. In paragraph 7 it mentions that they could build mechanical parts that can be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. If these parts of made, there may be a benefit to the scientists and every day people. These products can be made around the world and can be a benefit to everyday society.

In my opinion, I do believe that going to Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. You could find out many new things, see new things, and learn new things. I think that scientists and astronauts have a good idea of how to do it and I think they will eventually go to Venus one day, or at least figure out a lot about it. People on Earth should take risks and be able to expand their knowledge about the world and about the other planets in the solar system, besides Earth. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

In the Article it says that "" on the planet's surface tempetures average over 800 degrees fahrenniet "" which means it doesn't matter if it gets that hot in venus they are still willing to study venus. either ways saying in the article "" Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though mercury is closer to the sun."" there are some very good reasons on why scientists want to explore venus another reason why is because there is some stuff that are similar to the earth's surface saying in the article "" Today Venus still has some feautures that analogus to those on earth the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valley's mountains and craters ""

Each passage has its own main part about Venus, however, it will tallk about the challenge that are face in Venus

In this parts of the article the author has the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despiting the dangers and he explains his reasoning with the context that is left behind this article. The passage tells us about why its worthy to pursuit it, in passage 8 it says, ""striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The meaning of this part of the passage is telling us how people just think about how or what it is like to explore Venus. NASA has been trying to make inventions to help them go to Venus an have a closer look."" NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus.""

Althouth people want to go and explore Venus, there are some challenges that Venus provides for people. The dangers in this article tells us in passage 1 "" While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" its hard for us to explore something from far away but during the attemptes we still can get close to Venus. In the passage it says, ""A lot of spacecraft haven't survived the landing in a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" These are some reason why we can not reach Venus as worthly it is, it is challenging to explore.

The author does not care what kind of dangers there is because he thinks Venus is a planet that is worth to study. As he tries to get a closer look at. NASA has been also trying to help make machines and new inventions that are safe for people to go up and for themselves.

B25837D3D32D,"Venus, the second planet from the sun, has long been known as a desolate, barren, and hostile environment. Venus is devoid of any potential to support humans for the next several million years. Long story short, both manned and unmanned missions to Venus are expensive, time consuming, and provide no meaningful information that can't already be determined from earth, or a low-orbit probe.

The author presents the feat of missions to Venus as a ""challenge"", and rightfully so.

Paragraph 3 provides plenty of reasons to keep away from the second planet. The surface of this inhospitable rock is plagued with crushing atmospheric pressure, temperatures of more than 800 degrees, and highly corrosive clouds of sulfuric acid vapor.

""The challenge"" isn't much of a reason to toss away millions of dollars of research, no matter how large of a rush it gives humanity. The author also mentioned the value of scientific research conducted on our neighbor planet. Except, in paragraph 6, they outright state, ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely above the ground can provide only limited insight on ground conditions"".

Finally, an analysis of paragraph 7 doesn't give us any information that we weren't already aware of. Except, an interesting point was made. Using older, mechanical devices to take the place of electronic ones could negate the issues imposed by fragile silicon chips. Mechanical macines still need power, provided by batteries or solar panels, which are controlled by computers. A mechanical computer has just as many, if not more potential issues than an electronic one.

This article is fun to read, and is an excellent source of information about the planet Venus, but the author struggles to find valid reasons to go there.

The infromation that we could get form Venus could be never ending, the information that we could get could change everybodys life on Earth or potentially on Venus.

First, scientist have thought the planet Venus was covered in large oceans at one point in time and could support various life forms on the planet. in the text it says, ""Venus has a big gas ring around the atmosphere.""

E5888923A739,"NASA often wonders about each planet and if they can support human life. They often send astronauts out to explore the other planets in our solar system and see what lies on the surface. Related to Earth, Mars and Venus are the only other two planets that relate most to the Earth in ways such as climate and being able to support human life. Studies have been done on Mars and the studies show that Mars is very similar to the Earth but they have not yet determined if the planet can provide life for humans. But what about Venus? It is very similar to Earth as well but why have no studies been recorded on Venus?

Venus is often called the ""Evening star"" but it isn't actually a star, it's a planet. Venus is also called ""Earth's twin"" because of it's similarity in size and density to Earth. Venus, Earth and Mars all orbit the Sun, but at different speeds. These different speeds often result in humans being able to see Venus as if it is a star. Many spacecrafts have been sent to Venus to conduct stuides but none have ever been successful due to the conditons of Venus' surafce. I think that if humans could find a way to safely observe Venus and determine it's climate and what is on the surface, then it would be worth the risk of getting close to the planet.

Astronomers wonder why the conditions of Venus are the way they are such as being draped in a thick layer of carbon dioxide and what could have caused it. They are also fascinated by the fact that Venus could have been able to sustain oceans like Earth does at one time but they just haven't found a way to get down the the surface yet. I think if NASA could find a way to get down to the surface of Venus it would be important because they could possibly come up with an answer as to why Venus is not able to support life. The terrain of Venus is very similar to Earth, such as having hills, valleys, and mountains which makes astronomers wonder if human life could have actually lived on this planet at one time. But if humans could actually get down to the surface of Venus we could possibly determine what is causing the carbon dioxide blanket or what is causing the conditions of Venus to become so extreme.

Many people wonder, ""well how could humans get down to Venus without risking their lives?"" Humans cannot actually get down to the surface of Venus and have enough time to roam the surface of the planet and observe the causes of it's conditions because of the temperature and pressure beneath the cloud of carbon dioxide. Although these conditions are life threatening, NASA has came up with an idea to study and observe from a farther perspective. Planes hover over storms in order to keep passangers safe so NASA has came up with an idea to build a blimp like vehicle. This vehicle will be able to hover 30 or so miles above the atmosphere of Venus. By performing this experiment, humans will be able to safely observe the surface of Venus without putting themselves at any risk.

Although if this experiment were to actually happen, the temperatures would still be very high but the air pressure would be suitable for humans. The other let down of being able to stay above the atmosphere of Venus is that not enough light would be able to shine through the atmosphere of Venus so that humans could have a clear visual as to what is on the surface. It would help human curiosity if this experiment could be conducted but many other risks play a big role in ths experiment as well. We have to think about the right materials needed in order to safely send humans into space near Venus and to also make sure they are able to safely return to Earth. If we send humans up into space we also want to make sure they have the proper equipment to keep themselve safe. They would also need to have a backup plan/procedure in case something were to go wrong. A humans curiosities about Venus can be met but the correct knowledge and protection qualifications have to be met first in order to conduct the experiment safely.

8FF3200566C0,"Although, Venus is seen as unlivable and dangerous to human life, NASA has thought of an idea to defeat the odds. Venus is our neighboring planet, and once long ago, may have been the most Earth-like. To this day, there are still some anologous features. Will this be enough to convince the Nation that we should send NASA astronuats to Venus?

Venus is protected by a thick atomosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide. The clouds on Venus are highly corrosive. Temperatures average 800 degrees F, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times more than what we experience here on Earth. If our neighboring planet is so inhospitable, why do scientists want to visit it?

NASA has a possible solution to all of these conditions that a human cannt withstand. The article states, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" NASA's plan is to have a spacecraft floating above Venus' toxic atmosphere. Temperatures would still be toasty, at around 170 degree Fahrenheit. But the air pressure would be close to Earths at sea level. There would be enough solar power, and the radiation levels would not exceed Earth's. These are not easy living conditions, but they are just enough for survival. This brilliant idea does come with soem downfalls. The astronauts would not be able to collect samples of rock, gas, or anything from this distance. Standard forms of photography or videography would render useless.

I think NASA should not send researches to Venus without having enough background information. They should continue conducting research. If researchers would to Venus, they would have to risk their health and maybe even lives, to collect some samples. I think NASA should work on different mechanical and technological approaches.

Exploring Venus could give NASA insight information of its past, present and future features. Although NASA has come up with a seemingly brilliant plan, there is some downsides to it.

Venus can be sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.

However Venus can be ship obriting or hovering safly far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions because of the most forms of the light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. People cannot take samples of rock or gas or anything else from a distance. They are challenging many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to there knowledge if Venus.

Now NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. They are simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venu's surface and have lasted for three weeks i such conditions. There other project is called the mechanical computers. These devices were the first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940w during World War ll. All modern computers are enormously powerful flexible and quick, but they are tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

Venu's has been the challenge it has been a value, but not only becuase of the insight to be gained, but also that human curiosity will likely lead them into many equally intimidating endeavors. There travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited because by the dangers and doubts. It's really dangerous to be in Venu's because you never know what will happen in that planet.

D04B8C0FED99,"The author is this article, ""The Chanllenge of Exploring Venus"", did a very great job to support his claim that ""studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" The suthor starts off with explaining how its our ""twin"" and how we couldn't touch down on it for decades. Second, he starts to write about Venus's weather conditions. Then the author talks about how scientists want invest more into to studying Venus. Finally, he talks about how we should'nt give on discovering just becasue danger lies ahead. I will be sighting the details from the text to show how the author is supporting his claim or idea.

The author exaplains that it's our closest planet to Earth and it's right terms like density and size; meaning that the author is telling us the similarties between Earth and Venus. The text states ""Oftern referred to as Earth's ""twin"", venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" The author then talks about how Venus has note been touched in decades, which of course is very intresting matter due to the fact ist our closest planet. the text states ""Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" Well due to the harsh weather conditions of course no one has been there.

The author explains the weather conditions because he wants the readers to know why NASA doesn't have so much information about Venus. The text states that ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" Meaning thats basically impossible to get any information on Venus. The article also states ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" The author also writes about the temperture and weather more into detail. This is the author supporting detail about the danger Venus presents. Even though the very hostile conditions scientist still want to pursuit it.

NASA has a particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. The article stats that since they can't go to the surface they would have hover over the fray. The author is supporting or giving exaplains on how scientist are finding ways to pursuit Venus without going to the surface. The text also states ""Many reserches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This also supports how the author is giving details of pursuing Venus even though it's very dangerous. Venus could've been a better surviable planet than Earth.

The author explains that we should'nt stop just becasue we have a few problems to reach Venus. The author states ""...becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Meaning that humans are curious and will discover or find a way o discover things no matter what. The text also states ""Ours travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts"" Meaning that we should'nt stop because of all the dangers. That we should ""meet the very edges of imagination and innocation.

In conclusion, this is how the author did he a very good job on supporting his claim. he started off with explaing how its our ""twin"". Second, by explaning the weather conditions. Then by how NASA are finding solutions to get closer to Venus's surface. Finally by explaing how we should'nt stop discovering anything just becasue of the dangers of it.

E4473D13CDCB,"The author uses and explains many ways how to explore and how we can improve our knowledge on the environment and conditions on Venus.

He supports each idea in it's own paragraph and giving several options on how to travel and land on Venus. He informs on the dangers of Venus and how we can work around it and focus on ideas on how we can land on Venus. The author states that why hasn't a spaceship touched down on Venus surface in more than three decades. Is it about the temperature or have we not studied enough about the planet Venus?

In the introduction of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author opens up giving Venus the nickname ""Evening Star"", but then informing the readers that the nickname is misleading since Venus is actually a planet, not a star.

The author supports the idea of the pursuit to Venus by giving the readers more information on Venus and what it is like.

For example, the author states that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size.

Earth and Venus have similar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. In paragraph four, he states that venus might of been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system a very time long ago.

The author then informs us, the readers, that NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to Venus to study.

So the idea is that Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray of the planet. The author compares on how the scientists would do it to jet airplanes.

Traveling at a higher altitude to fly over storms. Doing so, the conditions would not be easy, but survivable. In the text, the author gives the conditions of Venus, such as the atomsphere. It's about ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide that covers all of Venus.

So it would be tough to see ground conditions. In addition, without being able to set foot on the ground, scientists would not be able to get samples of rock or gas to study and observe.

The author supports the idea of studying and if it's possible to travel and succeeding to Venus in many different ways.

In the article, he gives off examples on both ways. On if it's worthy to go to Venus and what the dangers are if running into them.

The author gives an idea on mechanical computers. Instead of using modern computer, mechanical computers can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces on Venus. One of the dangers he stated in the text was about Venusian geology.

He talked about the additional impediments such as erupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and frequent lighting that strikes on the surface.

In conclusion, the author does support the idea of studying Venus and if it's a worthy pursit despiting the dangers Venus has. He compares and contrasts the ideas of Venus. In addition, giving off many informative facts about Venus and it's conditions it has. In the last paragraph of text, the author thinks that human curiosity will lead us into futher investigation on Venus and many other endeavors. He thinks that we shouldn't be limited to the dangers and doubts we have ,but the imagination and innovation we all have. The final paragraph brings it all together and saying that we will one day set foot on Venus.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

In the text it states, "" ...(NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus... solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. The author writes this to add-on to influence the pursuit by having a safe way to get to Venus.

Futhermore the author supports the idea of exploring Venus being a worthy pursuit by adding information on how it relates to Earth. In the text it states,"" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system... Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have support various forms of life, jut like Earth."" The text also states,""... Venus today still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" Relating their challenge to Earth makes readers think about how Venus could have went from Earth-like to a pit of fire.

Additionally, the author supports the idea of exploring Venus despite its dangers by including information on how exploring Venus from a distance will not work. In the text it states,""... hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the group conditions...rendering standard forms on photography... ineffective."" To be able to explore Venus indept they will have to touch ground to explore effectively. In the text it also states,""... researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough misson to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal..."" The author uses this to show us that exploring Venus for our knowledge means we need to get onto the planets ground not hovering.

In conclusion the author supports this idea of Venus being a worthy pursuit despte the dangers it presents by including valid information to get to the planet safely, relating Venus to Earth and by giving information on why exploring from a distance won't work. To support the reason of Venus being a worthy pursuit the author is giving information to make people want to do something.      ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

Tare some details the author give us in the passage about enus being an worthy but dangerous planet to explore.

In paragragraph 2 he explains how its the closest planet to earth in terms to density and size. Its also closest in distance to us at certain times. Its dangerous because they sent several space craft and it only lasted a few Hours after it landed. Thats probably the reason why not a single spaceship has landed in more than three decades ago.

It would be hard to land there and stay ther because of the heat and the carbon dioxide. the atmosphere is almost 97 pecent carbon dioxide which would make it impossible to breathe in. The average temperature is over eight hundred degrees fahrenheit. the pressure is also ninety times greater than what we experience.

1E235AB03C8A,"Writing a strong and supported essay takes more than just advanced vocabulary and a plethora of facts . A strong example of this is the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". The author did not support his topic very well, because he didn't support his main idea enough, he strayed away from the topic many times, and his information is an abundance of opinions and assumptions.

First, the author brings up his topic of "" Studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". Despite this, the author only gave one full paragraph, out of the eight he wrote, on why humans would want to explore the planet ; he then preceeded to go onto the dangers of Venus, rather than why it is worth exploring. Secondly, the author ,many times, rambled on about other points that had nothing to do with his main idea. The author gave an entire paragraph about the new technologies that NASA is working on to explore Venus, even though his main idea is about why we should send shuttles to Venus. In the article it states "" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II"". This entire quote has nothing to do with the topic whatsoever, which shows that the author was gettting side tracked. One reading just this quote from the article would most likely think this article is about computers,and not why humans should explore Venus. Finally, the supporting evidence that the author did bring up, weren't very factual or even well thought out. One of the points brought up was ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth"". The author uses the word ""probably"" which means that he doesn't know this to be a fact or not. The author also wrote ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus"" ; this is an opinion, seeing as some astronomers might heavily dislike venus.

Even after our many launches of aircrafts into the atmosphere, we know very little of what it truly out in the endless void of space. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus specifically is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author would be correct in this statement as we humans know very little about the planet because of numerous factors making it a difficult planet to study, but solving those problems would lead into advancement. Including that becuase the planet is closely related to earth, that could mean it supported life long ago. Lastly that striving to meet the challenge presented, despite the roadblocks, would lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

The planet in space we call Venus has a reputation for how troubling it is to study because of numerous factors. As included in the article, Venus has ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets...clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid...planet's surface tempurature average of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit...Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater..."" Venus is an extremely difficult planet to study which is why it would be such an amazing goal to study it fully. If NASA and the people of Earth fight to overpower these issues, we would advance as a species, developing more solutions to fight these problems. By facing the problems presented by Venus, we would finally be able to study it and even find out is there is, or was life on Venus.

In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author stated that ""Astromoners are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Shortly after this, they also stated that ""Long ago, Venusm was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The search for life in space has been one outrageously demanded by the public and Venus may very well be the place to look, after we can penetrate the bounderies it has in store. It was even stated in the article that Venus even has features extremely similar to some found on Earth, furthering the support that Venus could have or does support life. Regardless if Venus supports life or not, if we as a species can get past the barriers of Venus, would lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors that we can surpass.

The author sugests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supports that when they say, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equaly intimidating endeavors.""

65AE2F1BF718,"As the author defends the claim that the exploration of Venus is a ""worthy pursuit,"" I, however, believe that this statement is not proven very efficiently. Although the author refers to NASA and the experiments they've carried out, the information just does not sufficiently back up the statement that Venus is a ""worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" The author continuously describes the challenge it would be for humans to carry out the study of Venus from space, as well as using terms that convey the assumptions he or she is making based on his or her opinion. Many risks would be taken in order to physically explore Venus, so with this information in mind, I believe the author did not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

In order for mankind to study the ""cloud-draped world,"" they would have to undergo much training to even be prepared to come near Venus and its harsh conditions. As stated in the text, the conditons on the planet are ""far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" Even with advanced technology that we have today, the article states that ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" If the technology we have today can't even survive the conditions on Venus, how are humans supposed to be able to? Even though the author claims the conditions are ""not easy, but survivable for humans,"" the temperature can climb up to over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These pieces of evidence from the excerpt convey the idea that Venus and its characteristics are far too dangerous for humans to even go near.

In addition to Venus' extreme conditions, the challenge of collecting physical evidence from the planet would be extremely difficult as well. Even though humans could possibly hover 30 miles above the ground level, the texts states that the vast distance would provide only ""limited insight on ground conditions,"" and it would ""[render] standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" Along with that, the author admits that ""researchers would not be able to take samples...from a distance."" The challenge that the study provides would simply not be worth the time, money, and risks. If man were to go to extreme lengths to reach within 30 miles of a planet and not be able to collect and evidence or data, it would not be a successful mission if the goal was to obtain new information about the planet.

Moreover, the author's word choice contributes to the idea that his or her claim is not very well supported. When examining the similarities between Earth and Venus, the author uses the word ""probably,"" saying that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The word ""probably"" gives off the impression that the author is making an assumption about the fact that Venus could support life just like Earth based on a common feature between the two planets. It is dangerous to make assumptions about subjects such as this, because it would be very costly if it turned out to be incorrect in the end.

After considering both sides of this controversial claim, I believe the author did not support the claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Although the author referred to the study being beneficial to man's sense of imagination and innovation, it is simply just too dangerous. The author repeatedly describes the challenge it would be for humans to carry out the study of Venus from space, as well as word choice that conveys the assumptions he or she makes based on their own knowledge. Many risks would be taken in order to physically explore Venus, and I believe the dangers could be more costly than the knowledge gained through the experience.

As stated in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin planet due to the characterstics the planets share, such as size and density. The author states that many scientists believe that Venus was once a hospitable planet like Earth. Though the surface of Venus can temperatures up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, it also contains many features found on Earth, like valleys and mountains. The author also discusses the use of mechanical computers, which is old, yet durable technology. These computers can be used in the heat of Venus' atmosphere.

You can learn who was the first to land on Venus and who was the last and how long you can stay on Venus until you have to come back down to Earth for more food and supples. Only one spaceship can go up there because they can't have more than 3 to 4 people on Venus doing the same thing, they don't have that much room on the spaceship for everyone that wants to go on Vensu anyways. Not everyone knows about Venus but if you go to NASA websit and look up information about it you can learn more about the planets around us and see how you can become one of the people to go on the other planets that are around us or just become one of the members on the station.

The average temperature is 800 degrees fahrenheit there so you would need a very high powered suit to keep that from killing you if you go to Venus. 800 degrees is WAY to hot for anyone to go up there and take a look. The ship would need to be checked out to make sure that the teperatures didn't cook the spaceship. The air level would close to the sea level on earth so we would have to be super carefull when we get off the spaceship to get information about the planet.

You can hover over Venus and look out the windows on the spacehip to look at Venus and youc can to try get information on it from there. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, soon we will know what they are talking about. Soon NASA will be able to get more information on Venus and if it is ready for living objects to come and live on it and if not then NASA can find another planet and study that one for a couple of years and see if that one is live able.

1DBC0C44D1D5,"The author is saying that the journry to Venus, despite it being very dangerous, is very worthwhile in the long run. The reasons why are a myraid and the reasons why not are the same likewise.

A great reason for why the we should travel to Venus is that Venus is our sister planet and could have had an ocean at one point. From all we know most life starts from water and if Venus once had oceans on its surface that could vary well mean that it has had some form of life on it at one point. If this were true then it would be a tremonus discovery for it would be the first life found that does not come from Earth. The evidence for this claim of oceans once touching Venus's surface is that it has mountain, vallys, craters, deep tenches that Earth similarly has when it comes to it's oceans.

Sadly however, the trip to Venus would be very exspencive and very very dangerous. Venus has a constant wave of violent storms, is constantly having volcanic eruptions, it's clouds and air are acidic and it's air pressure on it's surface is incredibly stronger than even our deepest of oceas. Not to mention that is comes into around 800 degrees normally. The evidence for this are in paragraphs 2-3 when it states that many unmaned aircrafts have been sent and none have been retuned do to them being destroyed.

Another positive is that if a sucsseful trip to Venus was made then it would mark a major shift in space exsplraion along with giving us a lot more insite into Venus's history. If Venus was to be exsplored by us than we would be given a tremondous amount of knowledge of the planet and of better space exsploration.

NASA and scinentists have been trying to find a way to get to Venus and stay on Venus. They have propossed a few awnsers: one is that they create a station that would stay above the clouds. The air pressure and acid leavels are not as bad above the clouds and the tempeture is lower as well. The only problem is that we wouldn't be able to get much knowledge from above the clouds because the clouds are so thick we wouldn't be able to see past them. Another awner to the problem is to use older tech. Stated in paragrapgh seven: ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tent to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" This means that new tech is less durable however older tech, which may not be as stylish, is incredibly durable, and could be the key to finally keeping a shuttle on Venus.

As the author suggests, studying Venus would help humanity tremondously despite the dangerous it presents; even though the planet is incredibly dangerous we would still benfit in learning about our sister planet.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
4857AEE59902,"In the article ""the Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author states that astronomers are so facinated with venus and its harsh environment because it is the most like earth in our solar system. In fact most scienetists believe Venus was covered in oceans and had the ability to harbor life in it. Getting a better understanding of Venus could help progress space travel and the way astronauts land ships on planets and deal with climate and research.

The author says that Astronomers are facinated with Venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system. The astronomers wan tot get a better understandimg of this planet as people may one day be able to set foot on it with enough research put in place. They need to understand the climate and the atmsphere before they can send any manned space shuttles there. The author said that unmanned space shuttles have been sent there before but havnt been sent in a long time because many of the shuttles would not manage to land in the harsh climate, and if they did they did not last long on the planets surface. Studying Venus maore would help astronomers understand how to better their space shuttles and make them work well, land, and last longer.   ",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
3C6C485C68E9,"The author of this article is only focused on one thing in this article. They describe all of these reasons on why traveling to Venus is unsafe yet completely ignores his own reasoning by replacing it with an unrealistic claim stating that astronomers want to explore it. Also, while they explain the density is the same and how Venus is ""Often reffered to as Earth's ""twin"","" they bypass the subject of how much will it cost, how it will affect the United States as a whole.

The author is failing to realise just how unsafe it is to actually go to Venus. They do go on to talk about the ""electronis made of silicon carbide,"" but it doesnt change the fact that we could not survive eight hundred degree wheather and neither could a space ship. the space carrier would melt when it came into the orbit of Venus. Also if the atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide is it really safe for anyone to go there. On Earth, we have a lot of pollution and a vast amount of carbon in the air but it is nowhere near the percentage in the article. Then you have a atmospheric pressure of ninety times more than our own. The article describes how that would crush a submarine that has been made to search the lowest points of the ocean. The article states in paragraph three, ""Also noteable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probe seeking land on its surface.""

The author is not taking into account the people who would need to go on this mission as well. We are talking about a human that if they were to get past the spot where they are orbiting that they will be faced with all of these horific obstacles. The lightning strikes would try to kill anyone who tries to find land on the surfac, yet they are trying to send people to find out about their curiosities? Are we okay with that? All of these factors will end up in a loss of a human if we try to step foot on Venus and that is not worth the curiosity of a few.

Attempting to go to Venus would be extremely costly and would be a very poor choice on our part in the long run. We are talking about putting a group of people and equipment that cost billions to trillions of dollars on a space exploration that has a vast possibility of not coming home. It would cost us a fortune and no onewould gain from it. Hypothetically, let's say the the craft landed, what are they going to have to face to get a rock and gas sample? The volcanoes, lightning strikes, and powerful earthquakes would kill everything and everyone on board before the can let out a sigh of relief. Venus may have been an Earth-like planet but as of right now, no one would benefit from an exploration there.

Venus can remain a mystery. The author writing this article is not thinking about the good for everyone and/or the possibility of it even becoming a reality. The whole article is flawed because even though we are alike in size and occasionally distance, no one has survived the landing for a reason. The planet is too dangerous for us to even think about trying to explore, so we will wait to see if factors change but for now the author wrote this article poorly. We are not ready at this point in time and we may never be but the curiosity of a few are not worth the risks.",6,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,1.0
C5D0CC288877,"Why Venus well it's simple ""our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"".

The author believes that Venus should be explored because they may be somthig on venus that leads to new innovations or it may very well just be the part that making it to Venus is the innovation. The author makes sure to list the dangers so that there won't be a basis veiw-point and that talks about ways that could work. Even though in the ways there are also flaws which are also pointed out but the author tries to make a point that evenn though we are right next to Venus we know very little and that Venus could have been like Earth in the past. The author tells the reader about how there features that are simlier to thoses on earth like mountains, valleys, craters and may have even had large oceans and could have supported many types of life forms.

While there are many dangers like "" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide"" even though past that there are coulds that contain highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere of Venus. Then there is the surface which avgerage temperatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit mean that even though it is farther from the sun than Mercury it is still hotter. Another thing the ""atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater the what we experience on our own planet"" mean that man can't even reach the surface of Venus.

65A51681A3D4,"Explore the unknown planet Venus with smartness and work. Venus is a worthy pursuit of studying where it have values of discovering new knowledge and the finding more about the planet itself. Scientist could discover the difference between our planet and other planets by atmosphere, geographic, time and speed. That is why Venus is a great challenge to us for humans to study.

First, in the text, Venus often referred as Earth's twin since Astronomers thought that Venus used to be a planet with many different life forms. The planet have suface of rocky sediment similar to our valleys, mountains, and craters. The planet might be a survivable place for humans but, not in a good environment.

The second reason, it is a diffcult challenge. Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system. Venus's thick atmosphere have almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that human can not breath it. They have limited time to breath if they are on planet Venus. It have atmospheic pressure that is ninety times greater than planet Earth. And that's not the only problem, the text say that, ""Even more challengeing are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" These condition are more dangerous than other human could ever encouter on Earth but, the worth of discovery is an enormous value for better technology.

The third is that researchers could come up with new better technology that can survive longer in worst condition. One of them is computers from modern time, since, they are ""enormously power, flexible, and quick."" And the other is using a material made for electronics named silicon carbide since silicon can survive on Venus's surface for three weeks. Humans can actually survive on planet Venus but not for very long time.

Discovering new knowledge with studies of Venus can lead us with equal thought of mind.

This proves that this have some value from going through dangerous challenge and hardwork. New ways for better survival is a worth to accept. Be always up on your challenge for new discovery.   ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

The author describes exploring venus as having value. This means something that is worth alot important to find useful. Venus can be another earth and maybe that way people can find many resources in venus.

First, the author despite the dangers that venus can be the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then earth atmospheric pressure. Not one spaceship has survived the landing no more than a couple hours. Even though the dangers this can be the author still says theres alot of value in venus. Scientist cannot take samples of rocks or stuff that venus has stuctures nothing do to the pressure and unsafety it is to land on the surface.

In this saying the author is saying thsat no matter what dangers are they shouldnt matter should not stop from earth expanded and growing shouldnt stop them from exploring venus. The author want to know more about venus despite every kind of danger and its a challenging planet to study.

Finally, after reading and discussing what the author suggests venus is worthy but therer are many dangers to exploring venus. dangers of landing,also dangers of the atomspheric pressure, the dangers of other creatures being there. Throught all of it the author will still agree that its valuable and shouldnt keep no one from studying it more.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
922293101A74,"The author gives lots of evidence and resons on this idea throughout the article. The author also gives some facts that really helps supports this idea. There are some really good things that are in the article that gives this claim some meaning. In all, the author did really good with this article and also put some good time into this article too. I enjoyed reading this and learned some interesting facts about Venus.

One major things that caught my eye was that the author used NASA as some research in his article. He also uses NASA as a resource to help with the support of this idea. NASA is a wide known for space exploration and research for our solor system.

At the beginning of the article, there is an introduction that gives some intesting facts about Venus. The author also talks about where Venus is in our solor system and how it is related to earth. This is a very good start in the introduction of Venus and what the article is about. In the third paragraph, he talks about what Venus atmosphere is like. There is termperature facts and the air you need to breath is useable. This starts to bring up the question. Is Venus worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents? The fourth paragraph, he talks about the terrain. This starts to bring up the question even more than before. In paragraphs 5-7 NASA is the main idea for those paragraphs. In those paragraphs also NASA research and facts are presented about this topic. The last paragraph has a powerful meaning and a idea that is very strong.

These facts lead to the evidence is many ways. Facts are what built and help evidence today. There is a lot of evidence that support my claim. Here is a couple of pieces of evidence taht support my claim. The first piece is that the author used NASA. NASA has done a lot of research about this topic. The second piece is that he used lots of facts to convince the reader taht he has put some time into makeing this article.

F7C458C740C3,"Throughout history space exploration has always been an intersesting and exciting thing, but with space exploration comes dangers. There are lots of unknows about space, which is one of the things making it so dangerous. There are things we do know, particularly about Venus. as some may call it; Venus is our sister planet, but it is very dangerous. Are the dangers of Venus to great that we shouldn't explore? In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author claims that studying venus is ""a worthy pursuit"" because it's the most like earth, It's sometimes the closest planet to us, and long ago it may have been similar to earth.

Venus may be dangerous, but it is actually called ""earth's twin"". Venus has a similar density and size to earth. This leads the average person to infer that Venus would be a possible place for us to go is Earth was ever destroyed, but do not be fooled. Venus' atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Despite that danger, the author believes Venus is worth exploring due to the similarity.

Another reason Venus is worth exploring is because sometimes it's the closest planet to us. Venus and Mars are our neighboring planets, and due to the differences in rotation speed; sometimes Venus is closer. This proximity is easily the reason why the author believes we should explore. Mars is the other neighbor planet to earth, and we're already discovering that. As a space explorer it's common knowledge to explore what's close before we get further.

The last reason the author may think it's important to explore Venus is because long ago it could have been similar to Earth. It is infered that in the begining Venus was covered in oceans and supportedforms of life. Even now Venus has a rocky and sediment filled base similar to earth. This sediment includes valleys, mountains, and craters. If we can study Venus now, maybe we can predict what the earth could turn to in the future.

Space exploration still has so far to go, so is there really a rush? Yes; exploring Venus would be an amazing accomplishment, but until we can there is so much more out there. We are looking into how to explore Venus with things such as, electronics made out of silicon carbide, mechanical computers, and so much more.

In my opinion i think they should study venus more because its a lot of thiings they can discover and they can know more about the planet. Venus in my words is a more secretive plant because no one has ever successfully sent a spacecraft up to venus and it came back. In paragraph 2 it said that ""venus has a reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study"", which means that venus is still left unknown and has no research on venus. Another fact about venus is that it is the mist earth like planet in our solar system.

E2DB09D2CEE7,"In the passage ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author writes about many differennt things that have stopped us from being able to travel to Venus. One big thing that causes a treat is how hot the planet really is. Another one is the atmosphere. One of the biggest of them all is that the planets are moving at different speeds.

Why is the planet so hot. Now no one really knows why the planet is that hot but not only is it to hot but the pressure in that atmosphere is also very high. The planet averages a temperature around 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The amount of pressure in the atmosphere averages around 90 times grater then what we have on Earth. With these conditions it would make life on Venus for humans inpossible like it talks about in paragraph 3.

Another big thing that causes a problem for use is the speed of the planets. Even though Venus is the closet planet to Earth at other times Mars can be. So because the planets are moving at such different rates in speed this is making it hard for us to send thing to it because the timing of the planets is off. All of these are talked about in paragraph 2.

The author suggests that studying Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it present because out of all the other planet in the solar sydtem Venus is the that is more like earth. It talks about how dangerous it is how the machines that they send to Venus dont last long because of things are in Venus. Obvisouly he or she thinks that its worth it because the author tells us how ""researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.""

The author had said that most likely probably at one point Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various of life, just like Earth.

"" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.""

Another challenge you may come across is the weather and other physical behaviors. In the passage for example it said, "" Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes,and frequant lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" That would be a tough challenge because you would have to land on Venus and then you would have to be prepared for the behaviors of the planet and its weather. Which you would need some equipment and tools to figure out how to successfully accomplish the challenge and being able to survive.

A third challenge you may come across is making the right spacecraft, try to make it a safe trip to Venus , and making a good landing. Just being able to be on the planet for a good amount of time. In the passage it said, ""Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner- in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned , and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.""

Astronomers claim that Venus probably had oceans and supported many different life forms just like Earth. The author states that the value of returning to Venus seems idisputable due to the fact that it is sometimes our nearest option. Since it is our nearest option and giving consideration to how long time frames of space travel are, this is a pretty good claim.

However researchers cannot take samples of Venus's surface by hovering in a ship safely above the planet. The author states that instead of looking at the problems as risks we should look at them as challenges.

The author claims that striviing to meet the challenges presented by Venus has value because human curiosity will likely lead us to many more equally intimidating endeavors. Also that our travels beyond Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation. So the authors claims for furthering research on how to get to Venus are, it's the nearest planet to us, it used to be very hospitable and much like Earth, and that we should see the risks as challenges and find ways to get past them. The author supported these claims very well.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
D6B9D9C293B4,"Exploring Venus has been a challenge that humans have been striving to explore for over three decades. In my opinion I believe that someday humans will colonize Venus but not anytime soon so there is no point in continuing to study it. In this article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author claims that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. I believe that the author did a great job with their claim and that they used many details to support their claim but they did not go into detail on the cost of these studies. The article is about the challenges and drawbacks from being able to explore Venus and the precautions that are needed to be put into account when trying to explore it.

As I have said, I believe that Venus will some day be explored and colonized. However I do not believe it will be any time soon due to the fact that there are hundreds of different drawbacks and challenges that are needed to be strategized before we can take a living human up there. Some of those challenges and drawbacks that are needed to be taken into account are that we do not have the necessary equipment to withstand the atmosphere on Venus made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets as said in the article. In addition, there are temperatures that average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit on Venus. Those temperatures are beyond anything that has ever been created to withstand heat.

In reality, anything that is sent to Venus will probably be melted and destroyed before even landing on the planet. I say this because the atmospheric pressure of Venus is 90 times greater than Earths. I can support this because in the article it says, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans have ever encountered on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" Even if Venus was once the most Earth-like planet why keep sending unmanned spacecrafts to Venus. The only thing that scientists are accomplishing are a few results on how to modify their spacecrafts but they are wasting their money on something that probably will not be accomplished in their lifetime.

In conclusion, Venus is one of those planets that humans are so fascinated by but it has many drawbacks and dangers. Therefore I do not agree with the authors claim but I do believe that they did a great job with using details to support their claim. In my opinion, due to the drawbacks and challenges that need to be solved in order to even land on the planet Venus, I believe that exploring Venus is a complete waste of time as of right now. If the exploration of Venus was coming any time soon then it would not have taken NASA three decades to get to the point that we are at now.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

Venus is not really close to the sun ans still have extreme heat but its closer to the Earth which often referred to as the Earth's ""twin."" It's more challenging because in Paragraph 3 its says,"" On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" the conditions are too extreme for a human for a human to set foot on Venus.

NASA is sending humans to study Venus to figure out what kinds of material they need to send a spacecraft to Venus and explore it. In Paragraph 5 its says, ""NASA's possible soultion to hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" Venus has almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide which is not good for human, so they would need much more material for the human to survive with all that carbon dioxide. Scientists are seeking to condut a through mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk (Paragraph 6).

NASA is working on studying more about Venus, but it's still risky for humans and spacecraft. NASA is now testing simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested on Venus's surface and has lasted about 3 weeks in such condition. In such heat the material should be liquefy because of extreme heat. It won't be easy but NASA is trying to make it survivalbe for humans.

9354251C8228,"The challenge of exploring venus is is that the atmospheric pressure is over 90 time greater then what we have here then what we ever will have here on earth. The normal temperatures on venus is about 800. The most we every get here is about some where in the 100s if you go to venus you will cook like your diner would. And there is way to much mercury on the plant. The plant havs a rocky surface. It has valleys and mountanins. It is kinda like earth.

NASA has an idea thst they want to send people up to go and study the plant but not put then not the plant cause you can't land on it. They want them to fly above it and study it. And see what they can learn about it and see about it. But still being that far away from the plant it would be 170. The air pressurse would be sea level on earth. They would be hovering about 30 miles above it. It would not be easy for them them but it still be survivable for humans.

NASA is working on a study on Venus with a diffrent approaches. One example is the silicon carbide that have been test in chambers. The have looked back at old technology. One called mechanical computers they where frist made in the 1800s. But they frist played a role in the 1940s.

They are looking for stuff that will give them more power. Modern computer are more powerful, flexible and quick. They need it to suroivoiur the heat of Venus. because it is not use to that much heat.                   ",1,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.0
1B61ACF51694,"Do you ever wonder how amazing it is to study another planet. Do think of all the risks it takes? Well the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by having a thick Atmosphere, shipping orbiting, and testing electronics made of silicon.

The first reason why it is challenging is that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide runs through Venus. In the passenge it states,"" on the planet's suface temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. ""This piece is important because it gives you an example of how the temperature is really high. Plus, the perfect temperature for a human is 98.

The second reason why it is competitive is that venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions. In the article it says,"" more importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" this explains how they can't be able to experiment things without there tools. This is challenging for them because they won't be able to do much. An example is that they won't be able to photograph and videograph ineffectively.

The third reason why they it is difficult is that some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in venus's suface. In the text it states, ""modern computers are enormously powerful, flexable, and quick but tend to be more delicated when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" This shows how technology from now can't be used in venus. In order for them to use technology is that they have to use those old computers from back in the 1940's.

In conclusion, This is how the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by having a thick atmosphere, shipping orbiting, and testing electronics made of silicon.

Venus is close up that there's challenges that researchers have done but there could be some danger in it. The danger could affect humans not being able to stay or experience the planet Venus. There are conditions and warnings on what could happen in Venus.

In paragraph 2 at the end says, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" This shows that humans haven't touched the ground since they can't survive there for more than one hour. In paragraph 3, it talks about how the pressure could affect danger on it's surface.

Also in paragraph 4 it states, ""the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and crater."" This shows that Venus has similar things to Earth and there could be an option of visiting. However, in paragraph 3, the pressure and heat probes seeking to land on its surface and can cause bad weather, erupting volcanoes, and powerful earthquakes. Humans have to be alerted by what can happened or else danger will come towards them in Venus.

Another exmaple is in paragraph 6 it states, ""Many reasearchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This statement shows that scientists are working on how they can get up close to Venus and understand more of it so humans know what to expect.

In conclusion, Venus has value of human curiosity. Scientists, researchers, and some humans want to know more about the planet Venus.

9D7B6188017C,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" article infroms the readers about Venus's harsh conditions and mankinds's curiosity to explore this unknown.

This curiosity has challenged The National Aeronaautics and Space Administration (NASA) to strive for a better understanding of Venus.

The author of this article supports this statement well enough, but could have supported his work better.

Throughout the article, the author describes the dangers of Venus explaining why exploration is diffiicult.

In paragraph 3, the author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,"" proving that Venus can not support human life or any of human technology.

The author describes the danger well, however, he/she does not address why Venus is a worth pursuit for discovery.

The author repeatedly uses the unknown aspect of Venus's physical attributes and humans' natural curiosity as the two main motives for exploration on this planet.

Paragraph 8 shows this by opening with, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author continuously uses those two factors as to why humans are so keen on pursuing this inhospitable planet.

There is a lack of evidence explaining why Venus is worthy of exploration but informed why we should be exploring Venus but the author describes the dangers of Venus very well.

To strengthen the author's suggestion, studying Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents, he/she should have included details on what the planet can offer humans or given more reasons as to why humans are so motivated to explore our sister planet.

The article stated that it is one of the brightest point of light in the sky.

Vince is the 2rd closest plant to the sun which meaning 800 degrees fahrenheit and the presseure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth, although Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun, if humans lived there ther could be a chance of additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and freqent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. Otherwise the planet would still have some efatures that are analogous to those on Earth such like Valleys, mountains,and craters.

Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit. Asronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may erll once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system and i trust that the astronomers would say that because we still think that Mar would be our planetary visit. Although humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on the ""cloud-draped world"" as they call it. They have said that no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours ,despite its proximity to us and, of course should like a big danger and risk to take, not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. NASA's possibile solution to hostile conditions on the surface Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.

Researcher cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance, Venus would need to get uo close and personal despite the risks, they are working on innovations that allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus, and some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simlating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. But now they use mechanical computers which were first envisioned in the 1800s and played lots of important roles in the 1940s, by comparison systems that use mechanical parts can be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

The author believes that ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"" which he succeeds to explain clearly but fails to explain why it would benefit us despite its dangers.

In the article, the author explains the dangers of exploring Venus. These dangers, said in Paragraph 3, are that ""a thick atmoshpere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" It also says how the clouds in Venus' atmosphere are made up of sulfuric acid, which is highly corrosive, and that the planet's surface is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These conditions are far too extreme for any human or spacecraft to handle and restrict us from studying and understanding the planet.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author vaguely explains why exploring Venus would benefit us. In Paragraph 6, the author begins to talk about how Venus would contribute to our knowledge and understanding of the planet. Apart from this, the author gives no reasons why we exploring Venus would be a benefit. The author seems to get off track more than giving explanations why Venus would be a worthy pursuit. For an example, in Paragraph 7, he begins to talk about computers during the 1940s which is irrelevant to purpose of the article. Staying on track and naming more benefits would definately improve this article and help support his opinions and ideas.

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author describes the restrictions that keep us from exploring the earth-like planet Venus. Although the author does well in explaining the restrictions and how scientists are working on improving technology to enable us to explore it, he seems to get out of focus. The author also seems to fail in explaining why Venus would benefit us thoroughly.

Hes knows this is a great risk but he still believes it could be done by a man and also thinks it would be worth it by acomplishing it.

DEC893591BF9,"The author in this story has a totally different persepective on studying Venus than most people probably would. He tries not to focus on the negatives since we all know that it's humanly impossible to step foot on Venus. He feels that hummanity shouldn't just give up on the mission forvever becasue it's dangerous and we have doubts on the mission. He looks at it as motivation and a challenge, rather than impossible. You never know what we could discover there so it's always good to have a strong imagination even if people think you're crazy, because those people change the world.

NASA is still looking into this research. They understand that they can't send humans to the planet, but they have a plan to send scientists in space to float above Venus and do their research from up there. Obviously their information wouldn't be as valid from being up above the planet rather than being on the planet, but it's the closest they can get to this day. In the future they hope to be able to create technology and machinery that is strong enough to withstand the preasure and heat from the burning planet. Resaerchers believe that long ago Venus was a lot like Earth, and was covered with a lot of similar features like valleys, mountains, and craters. This planet is looked at as Earth's twin, and long ago was once covered with large bodies of water and was able to support life just like Earth. That's why they want to keep learning about the planet becasue of how similar it really is to our own.

In the end, I think that with the way NASA's technology is adavancing, they will soon one day create a device that can gather information from Venus and send it back here. They have been testing electronics made of silcon carbide and placing them in Venus like conditions. Over time, they are slowly able to start lasting longer.

1A855ABD33BD,"Venus, Earth's ""twin"", has very harsh conditions. Unlike Earth, Venus is the hottest planet in our solor system. It has a very thick atmosphere, and the clouds are composed of highly corrosive sulferic acid. The aurthor of this article believes we should send mechanical mechines to explore this planet for all of its benefits, despite the dangers.

My first point, according to the article, is that Venus is the closest planet to the Earth in terms of density and size. Geographically, it has valleys, mountians, and craters. The author also suggests that long ago, Venus might have had oceans and that Venus could support life. This is why some researchers see value in the exloration. But, it provides the question: will exploring Venus be beneficial? The aurthor thinks that yes, this is a good opportunity.

My next point is that the author also states that we have already had missions there. If Earth poured money into going there at all, more than once, we must have seen some value in the mission because of its potential data and learning opportunities. The crafts may have only lated for days, but we still were able to learn. If we we not going to gain anything from the missons, we would not have wasted time and money to get there, multiple times.

Lastly, NASA has proposed a way to avoid the dangers. The facts about Venus are scary to some, but what if we could safely send a probe or spacecraft to Venus? According to the article, it would have to travel 30 miles above the landscape. Doing so would prevent the corrosion, it would have pleanty solor power, and the machine would not overheat as easily.

The author discusses the possibility of studying the harsh planet and why it is a worthy pursuit to take on despite the dangers that come along with exploring it. He supports this idea of exploring Venus by discussing how there is habitable area on Venus, presenting ideas that NASA is experimenting with, and giving background information on Venus.

In the article the author discusses how harsh and inhabitable the landscape of Venus is. Becuase the atmosphere of venus is ""97 percent carbon dioxide blankets,"" has ""clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid,"" the teperatures ""average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,"" and the ""atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater""

than the atmospheric pressure of earth, humans could not live on venus, but the author presents how humans could study it. If scientists were to be in a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape"" they would be in livible conditions of 170 degrees Fahrenheit and an air pressure close to the air pressure at sea level on earth; also, ""solar power would be plentiful and radition would not exceed Earth levels."" Venus may have very harsh conditions but there is an area where scientists would be able to safely study it's landscape.

Another point the author brings up to suport the idea that studying Venus is a risk worth taking is that NASA is alreday working on some things that they could try to use to study Venus. NASA has been testing ""simplified electronics made of silicon carbide... in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and [they] have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" One other project NASA is doing is looking at mechanical computers, an old technology that was ""first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in World War II."" The author explains that mecanical computers, that can ""be made more resistant to pressure and heat,"" that can make calculations using gears and levers ; unlike, modern computers that are more powerful but tend to be more delicate. These ideas that NASA is working on that the author brings up support the idea of safely exploring Venus very well.

Finally, the author gives the reader a lot of backround information about Venus that not only introduces Venus but also supports his claim. One thing he brings up is how all the previous missions to Venus have been unmanned, mainly becuse no spacecraft ""survived the landing for more than a few hours. He also says that this ""explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" Because there are such harsh conditions on Venus no man has been there, but It wasn't always like this. Venus was most likely covered ""with oceas and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth,"" and even today ""venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth;"" such as, the ""rocky sediment... valleys, mountains, and craters."" Venus was once like Earth so the discoveries tht could come from studying it are great.

In this article, ""The Challeng of Exploring Venus,"" the author discusses the planet venus and its harsh conditions that he believes should be studied. He presents many supporting ideas such as how on Venus there is a livible area that could be used to study the planet, NASA is already working on inovations that could help push the exploration and study of Venus, and that Venus used to be very similar to Earth.

D4CDA9866F61,"Venus has been proven to be a dangerous planet, yet scientist continue the attempt of research because it is believed to be a worthy cause, which is what the author believes in as well. Scientists have been trying to research and evaluate Venus for many years, however there are still many obstacles to be overcome. The author supports the idea that Venus is a worthy a pursuit despite the dangers it poses in a mediocre way. They could have gone about it in way which the idea was supported throughout the article, but instead the idea is not posed until the middle.

According to Paragraph 3 ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" These conditions are extremely dangerous for humans. The passage even states ""These conditions are more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" At first the author does poorly to support the idea that Venus is worthy pursuing because only the dangers, such as those above, are listed and supported with details.

As the article nears the end some solutions to the dangers are posed, enabling the author to support the idea that Venus is worth the pursuit. A possible solution to the ""hostile conditions"" would allow scientist to get close enough to observe Venus, however it would cause them to be unable to get any rock samples. Humans would have to stay at least 30 miles above the surface. The temperature would still be high at whopping 170 degrees Fahrenheit, however the air pressure would be close to that of Earth's and even survivable for humans. The author also states in Paragraph 5 that ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."" This could also allow for the possibility of life on Venus. ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.""

The author should have supported the idea that Venus is worth pursuing throughout the article, rather than beginning to support it in the middle. The author wrote plenty of negative facts about Venus in the first few paragraphs, causing the reader to wonder about the safety of ""Earth's 'twin'"". In order make the main idea clear the author should have listed a few negative things, and then contradicted them with facts and supporting details. This would have made the article stronger, immaculately organized, and more understandable as well. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
9F398ECA9C9B,"I do not beleive that the author justifies their statement of ""Venus has value"" in paragraph 8. The author does not explain the pros of exploring Venus as well as they explain the cons of why we should explore Venus. Why do I think this? Well the autor describes the deadly, hot and thick atmosphere of Venus, stating that the reason exploring Venus is worth the risk is because ""Venus still has some features that are analigous to those on Earth."" Well, does that justify spending millions or hundreds of millions of dollars on a rover or a spacecraft to explore it? I don't beleive so.

It's quite simple to explain why Venus does not need to be explored or closly examined from high up in it's atmosphere. The pros do outweigh the cons in this aticle, here is a quote from the author: ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" That temperature is obviously deadly to humans, and that is a major risk when it comes to spending millions on making a rover that will only last up to a couple hours just to get a glimps on the planet. Or maybe just to get a couple pictures. The author does not go on to say how exploring Venus with genuinley benifit the human race. The author simply explains how scientists are curious about the planet and what is on it, I do not beleive that satisfying our curiosity will help anyone. This is a quote from paragraph 8 of the article that states: ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likley lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.""

Now, to add on to the last quote I stated from the article, the author does not state what the human race would do with that ""insight"" that we would gain about Venus, they just state that we would have insight. well then I would ask the author, what is the point in the insight if we wouldn't be able to do anything with the insight that we have gained from the exploration? All that we would gain from spending millions on sending a spacecraft to Venus would be meaningless insight and the feeding of our curiosity. When there are many bigger issues to be solved here on Earth. For example, the crisis that is curently happening in Venesuala, their government is shut down and millions are starving, some familys have resorted in digging through the trash for food and we could help them, but instead we want to spend money on gaining ""insight"" about Venus? Which the article states that Venus is too dangerous to go to anyway. It angers me that half of New York could be underwater in the next thirty years from global warming but we are worried about getting a small peek into the world of Venus.

I do understand why Scientists would like to go to Venus, it would be a great acheivement for humanity. But I am a firm beleiver that our planet should come first, after all, we do only get one Earth, that means we must take care of it. Maybe one day when Our problems down here are solved and we have the ability to really gain benifits from Venus then I will want us to explore more. But for now I'm sticking to the thought that our planet comes first. In conclusion, no, I do not beleive that the author of this article did a good job at explaining why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers of it. Because in the end it's not just the dangers of going to Venus that keeps me from beleiving that we should. It's the problems that we are facing here on Earth that are far more important.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
1F6716F73D62,"In the text, The Challenge of Exploring Venus, the author explains why he thinks that we should continue to try and explore Venus, even with the harsh conditions Venus has. The author makes sure to explain the conditions on Venus and why they are so dangerous, but he also makes sure to explain why it is important that we find a way to deal with those conditions, so that we can continue to study Venus.

In paragraph three the author talks about the conditiolns on Venus like how it is ""97 percent carbon dioxide, and how the clouds on Venus are full of ""highly corrosive sulfuric acid"". He explains that the conditions are unlike anything that humans have ever encountered.

That is the reason he belives we should study it, because it is unlike anythig we have seen before. The argument gets even better when the author says ""Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. He goes on to explain the rocky conditions, they see on Venus, and the possible evidence on vast oceans that could of been.

The author supports his idea so well becuase he tells us about the harsh conditions on Venus, Which is the biggest factor making it so hard to explore, and then goes on to explain why that is the reason we should study it. It is because it is something new, and unknown. Not to mention it is belived that Venus could have been just like Earth once. Opening up the possibility of seeing where things on Venus changed.

So we can possibly stop that if Earth ever starts going into the direction that Venus has.

The author does a great job of explaning how what we see on Venus is unknown, and explaning that, that is the very reason we should continue to try and study Venus. He even gives alternatives ideas to landing on Venus. He explains that what is unknown and what could possibly be so closley realted to Earth should be studies even with the challeges in presents. The author best explained it when he said, in paragraph eight.""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
2826AD5F2F15,"The author uses a lot of clear evidence to discribe how the scientists are tring to study Venus. Also, the author discribes the dangers of doing so. The author also tells us what the problems are with studing Venus. The real question is, is it really worth it?

One of the biggest problems with exploring Venus is that Venuses aptnosphere is 97 percent carbon dioxide and the timperatures average over 800 degrees. Another problem is that the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than here on earth. Also Venus is some times mistaken for a star because the plannet is so bright.

At one point Venus would have had features just like earth and have water surounding it. Venus is also known as the the twin to earth because they are so similar in features. NASA would send shipes into space and go to Venus but they could never lang on Venus. They haven't had a succesful space travel to Venus in 30 years. NASA is thinking about sending a blimp like craft to venus and have it hover over Venus at like 30 miles off the ground. Even at 30 miles off the ground the tempurtures will be around 170 Fahrenheit.

With what the passage states it is safe to say that there are a lot of dangers NASA would have to address before they launch another space ship to Venus. But also there are a lot of possibilities that NASA has when they launch the space ship to Venus. NASA can be the ones who discovered Venus, also they could learn more about Venus and why it lost all its earth like features.

In conclusion, the idea of learning more about Venus is a great opportunity to learn more about the planets around us. Also, learning about how Venus lost the Earth like features is a good way to learn about our planet and how to keep Earth from becoming that way. This idea of risking everything to go and explore Venus is a great opprtunity for us at earth to learn about how other planets like ours were destroyed.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
43BF0D1F23DF,"Venus has the hottest surface temperture out of all the plantets; even though, Mercury is close to the sun . Did you know that ? Well if not maybe you should read ""The Challege of Eploring Venus"". The article pours out information about this evening star;however, you obtain more then just knowngle from this article. To contuie, the article expresses emotions and the author's feelings about the dangerous pursit to explore this marvlous planet.

So, did you know planet could have babies? Well I don't know if that entriley true, but Venus is the Earth's twin. Which I don't think should be taken littralle, because they're own twins thanks to looks. Which is pretty segrgated, but oh well. So back on topic Venus is classified as Earth's twin, because Venus is the closest plant in density, size, and distance. Also did you know astromers have theory that Venus couldv'e been Earth-like. They're fascinated that Venus couldv'e been covered with ocean and couldv'e even supported life. The astrometer only belive this, beacues the features that are analogous to those on Earth. Venus has valleys, mountains, craters, and even a rocky surface. This really helped support why Venus is worth the risk, because look at all this inforamation we know. Yet, how are we suppose to belive it's true. You see humans are very heavy headed, which means we are not very open minded to knew idea. To contuie, people are going to fight weather it's true or not. Humans need to see it in order to believe it.

Consquently, you may not think that humans need to see it to believe it. So, to get into our next topic some of the things I'm telling you about Venus may not even be true. We need to head into this challnge head first and hope for the best. We need to stop being scared of the what if's and be more scared of that nots. Many reseachers are working on innovtion that can help us obtain the knowlege of Venus, which is such a succes. For example, NASA is working on an invention to help reseacher fload above the heated surface. On the other hand, forms of light can't penetrate dense atmosphere, which would be tough since Venus atmosphere 97% carbon dioxide. To contuie reseacher can't get rock,gas,or any kind of phyical samples, but that why we need to keep pushing. If we wanna find out Venus's secerets we need to get up close and personal despite the risks.

To wrap things up, Venus is a strange planet that we don't quite understand, but it we just stay strong we can find a way to discover the truth. Also who know what the knowlede from Venus could help us do. Venus has value weather you see it or not. The author shows his feeling swithout being so in your face about it.

11D340267D98,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", paragraph 1 states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"". It has features similar to earth such as mountains, valleys, and craters. The author says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans, and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

Since Venus is similar to Earth, It has caught the attention of many Astronomers.

Despite its dangers such as the extreme temperatures, a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and the atmospheric pressure being 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth, it is worthy of being studied.

NASA has came up with ideas to exploring the planet. One of the ideas is to ""allow scientists to float above th fray"" as stated in paragraph 5. Hovering 30 miles above the landscape, there are problems that come with that.

When floating, the temperatures would still be hot, being around 170 degrees Farenheit. The pressure would be close to the sea level on Earth"". Solar power wouldn't be a problem and radiation would not exceed Earth's levels. Although the planet is not in the best condition, it's survivable for humans. There would be problems trying to explore Venus since the scientists would be floating high above the surface. The author states, ""researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else from a distance"". In order to explore the planet to the fullest, the only option would be to get up close and personal.

Since modern day technology is delicate, a different type of technology would have to be able to withstand Venus's conditions. A cell phone, tablet or anything related to that sort of technology wouldn't be the greatest considering it is easy to break. NASA has came up with the idea of using mechanical computers. These computers make calculations by using gears and levers and don't require any electronics. It has stronger material and is more likely to survive the conditions of Venus. The passage says, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of immagination and innovation"". To me this proves that Venus is worth exploring.                 ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
21B6A2F0B325,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author has shown how Venus is a planet that is worthy of our exploration through a few different points in this essay. However the author also uses many different examples of why Venus is/has been too dangerous for humans to venture on. But the essay does lean towards how necessary it is for humans to be curious about this journey more so than not, and they author does this using a few examples. Overall the author uses a large amount of their evidence from NASA mainly to describe certain ways they are trying to solve the problems and how they have started to already.

The author does introduce the con aspect of their essay first by explaining why humans have not been able to journey onto Venus' surface yet. They start by saying, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades""(paragraph 2). This is not the most reassuring few phrases when the goal is to get humans on the surface of Venus. But by adding this in the author is placing an understanding of what the dangers are. The dangers are plainly that if a spacecraft cannot survive the surface of our neighbor planet. . .then how can a human possibly do it.

So by adding in that scare factor the author then switches the tone to describes the certain parts of Venus that scientists need to get close to. Because in order to study it they need to be close enough to see it clearly. The author tells us all of the different features that are similar to Earth and because of all of these similarities scientists can learn and discover so much about our planet from Venus. The author names all of these similarities which are: ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system . . . has a surface of rocky sedimet and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters""(paragraph 4). When the author says this they are leading the reader in to want to know more about what Venus is like. This is because when they say that Venus is ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" they are making the reader wonder what Venus must be like. Also making the readers curious as to what humans can learn from this planet as well. Which is a major benifit in a risk management scale.

Next, the author also introduced a possible solution to the problem that is Venus' surface. They found out that NASA is doing their own research on how to land safely on Venus and to be able to withstand a longer duration of time there as well. The author said, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. . . Just as our jet airplanes travel at higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus woud avoid the unfriendly groung conditions by staying up and out of their way""(paragraph 5). This is a major point because if NASA is already finding different ways that they can have ships on Venus, they are a step closer to having a ship survive on the surface as well. This is also very important because as they are discovering different materials that are lasting in Venus-like condition, and they are learning more about what could work for humans. Because if they were to create the ship that would float above the fray; then they would be able to have scientist there to observe and learn about Venus. The only problem with this is that the scientists wouldn't be able to collect samples from the surface yet.

Furthermore, the author explained a few different points throughout the entire essay. Some of them consisting of cons to the situation, like how a spacecraft is unable to last longer than a few hours on the planet. But other parts of the essay were how important it is for people to go and search Earth's sister planet because of the very similar landscape that the two share. The author also added in some of the different solutions NASA is trying to decypher and perfect. For example the plan to have a ship floating over the fray so that scientists are close enough to make observations but they are just far away enough that they are unable to take samples. Over all, the author portrayed Venus as a highly worthy planet to explore and that there are many different factors as to why it is so important. ",6,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,1.0

EE0229233F51,"Venus is known as the second planet from our sun, it's sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" despite it wasn't a star at all. It was also referred as Earth's ""twin,"" since Venus is the closest with density and size in terms of Earth's. But, we really don't know alot about Venus. Now why is that we don't sent any rovers, satelites, ANYTHING to get some few informations about Venus for the last three decades?

Because anything that touched the surface of Venus surrvived less than three hours. Which gathered the reputation as the as the challenging planet to study.

What is the challenges of studying Venus? Well, first of all, The atmospere of Venus has a THICK layer of carbon dioxide the covers 98% of the planet, in which makes Everything a much hoter place,but, to top it of with the atmosphere problem, the clouds in there have highly corrosive sulfuric acid. If we some how passes through the atmosphere, than we'll face ANOTHER problem with the ground. Since Venus is the second planet from our sun and with all those carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the surface ground temperature is over 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. In which with the surface and the atmosphere, it could basically melt many types of metal with no problem. Another Problem is that the atmosphereic preassure is 90x greater than our Earth, with that much preassure could easily crushed a submarine that is built to surrvive the deeper end of the ocean. From what we gather small information from our space craft, the geology of venus pretty much have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.

Despite all of the troubles and challenges that Venus caused, many of the scientists, astronomers, and including the author themself think that it's worth all of the trouble to get s much information as possible to get to know more of Venus. But WHY is it worth studying it? Well, Astronomers are fascinated and interested in the past of Venus as many of them has theorized that might've used to be a lot like Earth from long time ago, with Venus used to oceans that support life like ours. Another reasons why it's worth the trouble and money to study it is that Venus could be our next Planetery visit as our nearest option.

To me, I'd thought that it wouldn't be worth all the trouble to study more of this when we can study other planets like mars that support life better than Venus since it's surface and atmosphere wasn't as crazy as Venus'.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
3552B9EDEBFB,"Is it possible to be too passionte about something? This author wrote an entire article on how challenging but worth it, it would be to visit Venus' crtiical atmosphere. How well does the author describe, or explain, their own opinion? They support this idea very thoroughly by these three things: The idea that life could have lived there before, the conditions are inhumane, and the fact that it could gain insight and can settle our curiosity.

To start, the idea that at one point in time there has acutally been life living on that planet is crazy. In paragraph four, it talks about how at on point there may have been big oceans like that are similar to the ones on earth. We think this because there are many rocky surfaces, such as valleys, mountains, and craters, that can only be formed from water eriodication. When you even look at it, it just look earth like. Obviously it has changed over the years but you can't rule it out. Is it possible there were living things on this planet at once?

Secondly, now the conditions are inhumane. How did they get that way? Paragprah three is all about what it is like on Venus. The temperatures now rise over eight-hundred degrees Fahrenheit. The air is absolutely unbreathable as it is made up of ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide. Not only is there carbon dioxide floating around in the air, the atmosphere is mostly made up of sulfuric acid which is very toxic to be breathing in that much. The air pressure on Venus is ninety times deeper, or stronger, than the bottom of sea level. If we even tried ot land on Venus none of the metals would last in eight-hindred degrees. There are also many impediments such as erupting volacnos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting. Minus all these problems we would have to find a way around, the author believes that it is still worth it to visit Venus.

Lastly, we would gain so much insight and our curioustiy could be settled. Paragraph eight talks all about this and about how this could open the doors for us to learn new ideas and come up with new technology that could even help up here on Earth. They also state in paragraph eight to support the idea that despite Venus' risky conditions it would still make a worthy pursuit by saying, and I qoute, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Which I interpret as do not let these conditions scare us. We are so smart and we can be creative and find a way around all of these 'problems'.

In conclusion, how opinionated and factual can someone be? How do you know to balance these two things? At times we have to be one-hundred percent curious about what we are writing about because you don't want to write an article on something you don't care about or find important. Overall, how detailed and opionated was the author? In the end, I think that the author did a great job at explaining why they think it would be a worthy pursuit.

Although Venus is not the safest place to explore, the author points out ways in which it can be done. He mentions NASA's idea of allowing humans to float above the fray as a way to see what is on Venus. When he says ""above the fray"", he is saying is that we could just place a blimp-like vehicle that hovers about 30 miles above Venus's treachorous landscape. This could work because as the author mentions, jet airplanes fly at a higher altitude in order to avoid dangerous storms. Storms that could knock them out of the sky and send them crashing to the ground.

The author also points out some interesting caveats that might prevent us from doing anything scientifically productive. They mention how just simply floating above Venus only allows us to see only a limited amount of stuff on the planet. This would be due to the conditions on the planet, such as the atmosphere being too dense to allow light to penetrate it. They also mention how researchers would be incapable of taking samples of things like rock or gas.

Luckily, scientists are working on innovations, possibly groundbreaking, that can help achieve an actually productive exploration of Venus. One such innovation is a simplified electronic that is made of silicon carbide. This is put to test in a chamber that simulates the conditions on Venus. The researchers are also looking back to old mechanical computers, which aren't a whole lot like the computers we have today and are more resistant to extreme conditions. Unlike our computers, these compuers make calculations using gears and levers.

In conclusion, the author supported his claim well that we can explore Venus despite its dangerous atmosphere. They rightfully point out good technologies that can be used to circumvent the atmospere and still be able to have a productive exploration. An example of such is the old mechanical computer.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
5.99E+11,"The claim that ""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"" is not well supported by the passage. Throughout the passage the author explains why Venus is exceptionally hard to explore, why it hasn't explored it in 3 years, and even the intrigue that it causes. It doesn't explain the benefits of exploring Venus and it doesn't explain the benefits of our curiosities. The passage explains more of the dangers of exploring Venus than why it is worthy to be pursued by any reason other than curiousity.

The first paragraph introduces the reader to the planet Venus describing it as an ""Evening Star"" that is easy to view from afar, but challenging to view up close. The author starts with these statements, leading the reader to the question ""Why is it challenging?"". Through the second and third paragraph it explains why it was explored and why those missions failed. This gives the reader knowledge on what Venus is and a picture of what Venus looks like, while also explaining some of the many reasons that Venus can't be explored.

In the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh paragraphs we see a shift in view point, where instead of focusing on the expected ""Why should or shouldn't Venus be explored?"" the author then moves to the topic of ""Why are scientists wanting to explore Venus?"". The answer? The author explains that the reason behind all of the searching for ways to explore Venus is merely curiousity. The author also explians the approaches to explore Venus, that NASA is taking, because scientists are curious. In the paragraphs it doesn't suggest that exploring Venus is worthy, as it only explains why exploring Venus has failed, how any missions now would fail, and what NASA is doing to approach their curiousity.

In the conclusion paragraph, the author explains that the challenge that Venus presents is what fuels the curiousity of many scientists. It also states that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts..."" proving that the author was not focused on proving that it is a worthy cause but more of saying, we should not be grounded because it's dangerous.

The author's suggestion is not well supported by the claim, as it has been shown that the author only focused their attention on how dangerous and scary Venus is and not on how exploration of Venus could be beneficial to understanding and history. The author's claim would have been better supported had they focused on the benefits of exploration and why the attempts to explore Venus are important, other than the filling the questions that are asked about the hardly known planet.

BF7AC5A91680,"The claim that the author supports the idea that studing Venus is worth pursuit despite the dangers because they maybe the issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decade. The dangers and pursuit are higly high risks for people and NASA.It is dangers because Venus is the secound planet from our sun and the atmosphere in Venus is almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets. Even more challenging is that the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere. On the plant surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. The despite to go Venus is that they are hoping to look for something their because the plant has surface rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,mountains,and craters. Somethings that we some how have they call Venus Earths sister. That why I think it so despite that NASA wants to see what else Venus got that the plants sister does not have.

An explanation of the article that supports my claims are when the author says this ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself,but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Also when they said ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""Venus is also dangers for people because it has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system,even though Mercury is closer to our sun.""Beyond high pressure and heat,Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes,and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

My conclusion to the authors writting is that they will not end up sending people to Venus because its to risky. They will end up sending newer technoligi up their so that they could see what the sister of Earth got. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth -like planet in our solar system. Venus is most likely the most compared planet to Earth. Is to dangers for people because its the secound planet hottest then the Sun.               ",1,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.0
2CCEF48C3D7A,"The ""Evening Star"" as the author from ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" is another name for venus. Venus known for being inhospitable to humans has been subjected to debate if we should send more explorations to the planet the author of this article thinks so. The author debates that the value of going to venus is worthy despite the dangers and obsticles we face.

A point that the author provides is that Earth is similar to Venus and that we should conduct further studies on the planet. A point that the author makes quite often to show that we can learn about our planet based off learning from Venus, ""Today venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters"" (Exploring Venus). from this peice of evidence it is clear that the author is trying to establish a link between earth and venus, That venus is very similar to us so it is worth exploring. Another example of the author connecting earth and Venus is when the author writes about what could of been on Venus ""Long ago, Venus was Probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth"" (Exploring Venus). The wrtitter of this story specifically said ""just like Earth"" because his goal is to establish the scientific evidence that could be gained from going to Venus because it is similar to Earth.

Furthermore the another reason that NASA should send a manned mission to Venus is that it may be the only chance at a expodition to another planet. The author provides information on how close Venus is and how this can be crucial ""occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, Mars, our other planetary neighbor orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimnes we are closer to mars and other times Venus"" (Exploring Venus). The author provided this information to follow up with another quote that comes in a later paragraph. The author follows up on this saying that venus is our the closest planet to us and that going some place closer will lessen space time travel ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit a curcial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (Exploring Venus). This is crucial to have considering that many other planets our very far away making them harder to get to and making them more expensive missoins. So when venus is closer this will increase the support of a trip to evaluate venus because it will be less expensive and easier to get to then a normal space exploration.

How do we finally explore Venus if its worth the pursuit the author describes this as being a challenge but one that we must overcome to explore venus. One way that NASA can over come overcome the challenge of exploring venus is by using technology that is old bulky but most importantly strong. ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions"" (Exploring Venus). This is an important peice of information the author provides to over come the challenge of going to Venus and that we can be saved by technology from the past. Another way NASA could send astronauts to venus is through a giant Blimp in the upper atmosphere of venus ""A Blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roling Venusian landscape"" (Exploring Venus). a blimp is very helpful when it comes to not burning alive on the surface of venus because it is to hot but this approach according to the author also has some set backs. ""researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientist seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal"" (Exploring Venus). This is important to know considering that the authors main point is that we need to actually explore Venus but this hinders us to actually do so which ultimately defeats the whole purpose.

In concluison Venus is a chaotic and hot place unable to support life but the Planet is also worth exploring. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" insist that going to Venus instead of other planets is worth it because the value of going to venus is worth it despite the challenges we face going there, the author presents this claim by explaining that, it is similar to Earth so we can learn about our planet as well as Venus.

Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system: many livings can died and even a mental can melt too. The atmosphere of Venus contain alomost 97 percents of Carbon dioxide.

Now scientist are trying to go to Venus to study more about the planet. Scientist say that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. What do you think about it? If you were a scientist will you go to Venus to study more about it? It it were me I won""t definitly not do it. It is a dangerious planet, because livings things and non-living thing can died out of the heat even a mental can melt in a minutes.

First, Scientist say that studying Venus is a worthy pursit despite the dangers it presents. They want to study more about Venus not only because of the insight to be gained the planet itself. But also because they want to tell many people about the planet. They also study the Vanus because they think that human curiosity will likely lead them into many equally. More importantly scientist cannot take sample rock from other world to do research.

Secondly if Scientit don't study about the planet of Venus we will not know nothing about the planet itself. If they don't study about Venus we will not know what happen in the begining on Venus. We will also not know if life exist on Venus. We will also not know is Venus a planets or a star and what is the closest planet to Venus. We will not know why Venus is the hottest, even thought Mars is the closest planet to the sun.

Finally We know all about Venus because scientist study about the planet. We know that Venus is a planet that is the brightest in the night sky. We also know that Venus is the hottest planets in the solar system. Futher more we know that anything can melt in Venus. Also if scientist don't study about the planet of Venus we will not know what kind of life exist on the planet of Venus.

In conclusion we know how important it is to study Venus. Venus is the closest to our Earth and It is the second hottest planet from the sun. The planet of Venus has almost 97 perscent of a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide. Scientist study about Venus even thought it is dangerious, so they can tell us more about it.

Also every other spacecraft that landed on Venus only survied a couple of hours.

My conclusion is that as much as us humans try to get up and personal with Venus it will never happend because of how dangerous it is.

39EE8E717661,"Venus is a planet in our solar system, which is sometimes visible in the Earth's night sky. Scientists are considering ways to get humans to Venus, and in order to accomplish this goal, continue to study it. The author of this essay is heavily in favor of continuing research into Venus, regardless of Venus' incredibly harsh conditions. That this is the main motivation for the writing of this essay is kept very clear throughout the text. To this end, the author makes his text well argued by providing varied and factual support in favor of studying Venus, such as Venus' similarities to Earth, its proximity, and one way scientists are considering surviving on Venus once they get there.

The author provides copious reasoning on why Venus is a planet well worth studying, but his primary argument is that Venus may have been the planet most similar to Earth at one point. This is a valuable point in the author's argument because it explains the similarities between Venus and the Earth, regardless that these similarities may be firmly in the past. For example, Venus may have supported life just as Earth does. Venus also has some features similar to those on Earth, such as mountains, craters, and valleys. These are important points, because the more similar a planet is to Earth, the easier it will be to survive there. This argument's aim is to show the reader that exploring Venus is a goal that could be beneficial to humanity in the future.

The other main point that the author provides is that Venus is, at times, the planet closest to Earth. The author goes so far as to say the planet ""is right around the corner"" in terms of space. Since space travel already has an impossibly long time frame, this is a crucial piece of information. Humans will not stop exploring outside the Earth, and that journey is sure to be difficult no matter what, but going to Venus might make the trip at least a little bit shorter, and therefore simpler. The reason for this particuar argument is that it makes the reader feel that going to Venus is much more reasonable than anywhere else.

The third reason the author's idea is well supported is that he gives a possible method for humans to survive on Venus. This reasoning is both specific and factual, describing a blimp like vehicle that would be located in the survivable part of Venus' atmosphere. However, the author also specifies that a hovering ship is not nearly enough to truly study a planet, and that NASA is already trying to find a method that would be superior. Both of these details give the reader the impression that Venus is truly an attainable goal. Futhermore, the reader is led into believing that if humanity is going to go to Venus, it needs to understand what it is going to.

In short, the author of this text wrote a well structured, well supported essay that pertained to why humans should explore Venus. There is next to no information that does not pertain to the chosen topic, which is a mark of a solid essay, but more importantly, he supports his ideas. The author describes the reasoning behind exploring Venus, rather than another planet. Furthermore, he specifies how such an act would be done. Together, these traits of the essay combine to make it very convincing and persuades the reader that exploring Venus would, in fact, be a worthy goal for humanity.

First we need to out what claims the author made that support the idea of exploring and studying Venus. Firstly, the author points out that long ago Venus was most likely like Earth in the fact that it probably had water and lifeforms on it's surface. And they also point out that Venus is the closet option for a planetary visit. Here's my problem with the authors claims, and that is that they have no hard proof or that they don't go into detail. For example, the author theorizes that there were lifeforms and water on venus, but we have no proof for either of those statements. The author also claims that the value of returning to venus is indisputable even though the problems with returning outnumber the benefits.

In The Challenge of Exploring Venus , the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because its the ''Evening Star '' and its similar to earth and often referred to as it's twin.

Even though venous is dangerous its a mystrious planet to look out for and its the second planet to the sun.''Atronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well may once have been the most earth like planet in our soloar system''.'' long ago venus probably was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like earth''. Till these day venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys mountains and craters. Venus can be our nearest optio for a planetary visit. Whats the value of returning to Venus if the mission can be both safe and scientifically productive?

Although NASA has thought of sending humans to study venus to see how the conditions are up there . However the conditions are not easy but its survivable for humans. Its the risk to take because venus its fastnacting to discover and see what life is up there? Can humans surive yes or no life changing experence.

In conclusion of the challenge of exploring venus it has value ''not because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself but also human curiosity will likey lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.''

Reseachers can't take gas or rock samples from venus so that is why no matter how dangerous venus it's so interesting for the author.

The astronomers are planning visit so they can see the different things on venus or the earth like things on venus. The dangers of venus aren't dangerous to astronomers they are just challeneges.

Why is venus called the evening star? Well it is as know as that because it is one of the brightest points of light. Or the twin of earth.

For one, he does state that yes, of course it is very dangerous studying Venus and it's suroundings due to all of the risky factors on the plantet; Though he talks about how it could be helpful to learn about it. He talks about how it could have been Earth like in nautre, it could bring us to new discoveries, and how we as people are hungry for more knowledge and that Venus is a good start off challenge for exploring.

At first, he states that one,Venus is stated to be called our ""twin"" when it comes to terrain;Along with stating that,""Venus is the closest plantet to Earth in terms of density and size."" He then talks about how Venus would have likey had oceans of water just like Earth, and could have housed life such as us. Clus being that it's terrain is very simair to urs, with moutain and caverns and so forth. Why this is a such a fasinating thing is because we as humans are currently looking for life on other planets and if we had ever found out a way to get samples from Venus, we could maybe find idems,clues, and or evidence that Venus was like our plantet today, that it housed some form of lifeform and would maybe be able to give us evidence that maybe we or weren't alone in the universe.

It also gives us the chance to explore our bounderies with science and technology. We learn that Venus is far from a life housing plantet today. As the author goes into detail. We find that quoted from the article, ""surface tempertures average over 800 degrees."" ""such an environment would crush evena submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our ocean."". We can clearly see that nothing we have currnetly could master the terrain of Venus. He starts going into how this could challenge what we have now and how maybe if we can overcome this bounderie, then we can advance more and more into the field of space travel. Scientists are already coming up with new ways to study Venus without having it's furture people abroad killed in the process of stuying the surface or having the technolgy we send melted upon impact.

Although there are many risks, it could help scientists better understand how common Venus and Earth are. The author states that Venus' ""temperatures average over 800 degree Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.""

Exploring Venus might be a big challenge, but scientists part of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) aren't ready to give up yet.

Many scientists at NASA are working to create a Venus space program. This research is supported by the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"". The article does this well, by providing factual evidence, deterring counterarguments, and rethinking the problem to be easier to address.

One of the most important parts of any claim is the evidence. The article fufills this with arguements that Venus is easy to reach. The author states that ""Venus is sometimes right around the corner--in sace terms"" (Venus 2). They also used evidence to address the problem that Venus is inhospitable to humans. on the surface, Venus is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, but the author points out that a vehicle at a much higher altitude would have a temperature of around 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

That isn't the only way problems such as this could be averted. The author also includes some NASA research on elecronics and mechanical computers that use no electricity and don't easily break.

All of these now solved problems have deterred scientists from finding ways to research Venus. The author addresses this as well. They say that ""maybe we should think of them [the problems] as challenges""(Venus 6). This way of thinking makes getting to Venus seem much more achievable.

This shows the readers that Venus is worth studying because there may have been life on this planet. Therefore, NASA needs to send researchers to Venus to identify if there is life or not. The author gives another example by referencing Earth-like features to show that thesremay be some form of life or a way of nature, these references include Venus having mountains, valleys, and craters. This validates the authors point well.

The author also gives ideas on how to help make a possible trip to Venus easier and less dangerous. They talk about using a bump-like vehicle that orbits or hovers about 30 miles above the surface. This vehicle has benefits, and also gives disclaimers. Some benefits would include astronauts being able to explore the land easier, avoiding the ""unfriendly"" ground, and keeping good air pressure. the text states ""however, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safey far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, redndering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" This shows as a disclaimer to give unbiased proof ofnegative effects.

This article is full of evidence to support the authors idea of studying Venus. The author referred to Earth, recommended ideas, and a technology project used with old computers to support their claim. In conclusion, this article had very well put-together evidence, and proves a point that Venus should be studied despite the dangers.          ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
38DD98A04439,"Have you seen venus in the sky while your star gazing? although venus is often refered to as ""earth's twin"", it is challenging to explore. venus is one of the more challenging planets to explore for a couple of reasons. those reasons are, the caron monoxide, sulfuric asid, andand the severe temperatures.

venus is covered with a thick blanket of carbon monoxide. this is one of the reasons that makes it very dangerouse to go there. based on the article ""the challenge of exploring venus"", venus has "" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon monoxide"" .this mutch carbon monoxide is very dangerouse.

the even more chalenging part is the sulferic acid.

the clouds on venus are filled with sulferic acid. not only is that dangerouse but the sulferic acid is,""highly corrosive"". highly corrosif is almost like saying flamable.

and if the sulferic acid wasnt dangerouse/hot but the temperatuer alone is enough to kill you. here on earth we experience heat but on venus the heat is extreme. in the article it states, ""on the planets surface ,temperatures average over 800 degrees farenhieght""

if you were wanting to try making it, good luck, but based on the information it seems like it is not recomended. so stay home on earth. enjoy the fresh air and life that awaits you. it is to dangerouse to waste your time on.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

venus is a very worthy planet to study because nobody has ever been on it to know if there is any kind of life ont hat planet , or if plants can grow or anything. because its the closest planet to earth but the hardest to land on.

because venus really used to be covered with oceans and etc just like earth and nobody can really tell what it looks like now theres just alot of curocity. a bunch of people wondering what it looks like.

but venus is covered with a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets. But its even more challenging with the clouds and highly corrosive sulfuric acid.

EC0DB16948B2,"Venus is a rather intriguing planet that mankind would have a great interest in studying. Venus' great danger is what's stopping us from examining it up close. The author tries to say that overcoming this danger is worth dealing with to explore Venus, however. I believe their claim is valid and that there is value of trying to study the planet, even with these dangerous conditions. There's even a decent chance of working around the risks. The author uses reasons like it's the most Earth-like planet, studying Venus from a ship orbiting around the planet isn't insightful enough to learn much, and that NASA is even coming up with different methods of studying the planet to justify their idea.

There's a lot of evidence to suggest that Venus was originally similar to Earth in quite a few ways. The planet was likely covered with oceans that could've been able to support life. Venus also had other features like rocky sediment, craters, valleys, and mountains. Venus is also sometimes the closest planet to Earth, often swapping back and forth with Mars being the closest. This evidence shows that it's likely Venus was essentially an alternate version of Earth.

It's also a good point that hovering above the planet and observing it just isn't effective enough at gathering information. Since the atmosphere is impenetrable to light, photography and videography of the surface is near pointless. The inability to go down to the ground and collect samples of the materials, substances, and gases hinders our ability to understand the planet. Researchers are even considering innovating space technology to allow us to gather some form of meaningful knowledge. We need to advance past observing from an orbital space station and find a way to get down there.

NASA realizes that problems could be solved with the right approach. They've tested how long some electronics made of silicon carbide could survive in Venus' conditions and so far, the results have shown that there is potential. Building resistant computers may also collect information on the planet, but mechanical computers may get this job done the best. Mechanical computers were used in World War II, but they were sturdier than modern computers and don't require any electronics to function. If one method of getting closer to the planet doesn't work, we could always try again with another.

Overcoming the dangers of Venus is currently one of the toughest challenges of space exploration we've seen yet. With enough determination and patience though, we can find a way to work around this dilemma; especially since NASA clearly hasn't given up working on solutions. This may be necessary too; our current method of studying this place just isn't that good. The reward may be worth the effort too since Venus is one of the most interesting planets we've attempted exploring. Let's just hope that this won't stop us from wanting discover the whole universe.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
FBF9D2EFA26F,"Venus is the second planet from out sun and Earth comes after Venus. The name Venus has another name and it is called the ""Evening Star"". However, the Evening Star is a misleading the reason for that it is because it is a planet. The reason why it's misleading is because its one of the brightest points of light in night sky. How are Earth and Venus alike to the other planets, what was Venus and how was it like, and why it is dangerous and why should we study it more.

First, Earth is known as the twin to Venus. The reason is because Venus is the closest planet to the sun and and its closer to planet Earth. Another reason why Earth is called its twin is because they both have the same density, size, and because its the closest in the distance too. After Earth comes Mars so it goes the Sun, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Those three planets orbit the sun at different speeds and what that means is that Earth is more closer to Mars than we are to Venus.

Long ago Venus was maybe covered tons of water such as our oceans and maybe supported animal life there. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. The clouds are the most challenging because of they are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atomsphere. The temperature on the planet surface is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The pressure of the planet is 90 times greater than what Earth experiences. The conditions on this planet is way more extreme than what the humans have.

The reason why its dangerous is because it the surface is way to hot because Venus is closest to the sun. The reason why its dangerous is because there is high pressure and heat that can cause erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquake, and on going lighting strikes. The reason why we should study it more is because Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Just imagine the thirty-plus miles above the surface like an airplane, the temperatures would be toasty at about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The air pressure would be closer to the sea level on Earth. The solar power would be more than enough, including the radiation wouldn't exceed to Earth levels.

Venus is planet not a different type of star, and it is the second planet. The Earth and Venus are simliar to each other. Venus is a very hot planet because its closer to the sun and the conditions on that planet are too extreme. It's a dangerous planet because of the erupting volcanoes, very powerful earthquake, and also lighting strikes coming down to the surface constantly. This how Venus was like, how its simliar to earth, and how it's dangerous but they should keep on exploring it.         ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
BB3E600B4BCA,"Venus is considered as Earth's twin, so why not explore it and have information about it, right? Allowing the people on Earth to be educated about space life is incredible and would probably do so much for us. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports his idea very well by educating us of the idea that Venus may of had life on it at one time, explaining to us that we need to chase our imaginations and telling the idea that Venus is basically the sister of Earth!

Life on Venus. That may of been the case a long time ago according to many astronomers. The article states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" If Venus once had the ability to support life, it might have that ability again! If we take the risks and time to explore Venus, we might not just have to choose what country or state to live in. We could possibly choose what planet!

Being a day dreamer or someone who thinks often could give you a whole new world. What if we literally had a whole new world though? According to the passage, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" To imagine the population on Earth becoming smaller because of people going to live on Venus is amazing and wild.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth, referring to size and density. The author mentioned ""Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" If that is the case, then we should explore it to make it the TWIN of Earth.

Life on Mars was very well thought of, but now Venus has come into the equation. The author of this passage makes his thoughts very clear that Venus is a risk that would be well taken by, implying life may have already been on Venus, Imagination can get the best of us and we should let it sometimes, and Venus is identical to Earth, so we should at least try.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

If we find that we can live on Venus with this research, then why shouldn't we. There were a lot of failed missions to the moon and now look what we know about it. We learned so much because people decided to risk their lives in order for us to learn more about the universe.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size ,and occasionally the closest in distance too, venus is a planet visit for the people,venus have many things that are interesting the people vistit this place for know somethings that they don`t know but they need know venus is one planet that are close with mart and earth venus is study for the humsn science.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon blankets venus. On the planet the temperatures average can be over a 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is like 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet,the conditions of the this planet can be more extreme than anything humans encounteron the planet earth venus is the only planet that have hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system,the other planet that are closer to the sun is mercury , beyond high pressure and heat.

In all of this we have a question Why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface.?

DF082C5AC45E,"Imagine growing up in a city 30 miles above the ground and wearing a suit all the time to protect yourself from the envirement. This is life on the planet of Venus. There are many dangers such as the temperature being 800 degrees Fahrenheit, the pressure that is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth, and clouds of sulfuric acid everywhere but is it worth it?

In this article there are many reasons to not explore Venus, some say it may not be able to be done but NASA belives that if we use a blimp like vehicle to explore 30 miles above the surface then the temperature will drop to around 170 and the pressure will drop aswell.

There is a saying ""The needs of the many out weigh the needs of the few"" and in the situation of our planet being compremised in one way or another that is very true. If we need another planet to flee to we could go to Venus but we would need exstensive research first in order to find out if it is even possible to survive on that planet.

Life would be a lot more difficult living on Venus but based on this article it might just be possible. Living on Venus would mean we would have to make tons of improvements in our technology so they wouldn't be totally inferior in the extreme conditions of Venus's weather. Our tech would have to able to handle all of the heat and everything else without over heating and exploding all the time.

In conclusion I think the author did a good job in explaining the conditions of the Venus and all of its surprises it holds for us to find. The author also adresses the technology advancements we would have to make aswell as gives us motivation to explore and create by saying ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
262DE6216C23,"The author supports the idea that Venus is worthy to pursuit despite the dangers by telling us several things. That this is our neighboring planet, by showing us that we need to expand ourselves and explore, and by telling us that Venus is as close as a sister planet could come to Earth.

One reason the author tells us we should examine Venus further is by telling us how close this planet is to us. Venus, like Mars, is our neighboring planet. In the text, it says ""These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus."" Since Venus is so close, the author tells us that we should be exploring it. Another piece of text evidence is ""Because Venus is sometimes right around the cornerin space terms..."" The author tells us again how close Venus is to us. The risk here includes getting a shuttle close enough that could be of help to us. ""More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" This evidence tells us that even if we were to get close to Venus, we couldn't take samples with our technology the way it is now. We would have to develope better technology. This evidence further shows how the author thinks that it is worthy to pursuit Venus, despite the dangers.

Another reason the author implores us to keep exploring Venus despite the risks is that we need to expand our horizons beyond one planet. The author supports this in his concluding sentence ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This shows how the author wants to push on rather than to simply settle where we are, despite the risks. The author also states how exploring another planet would help further understanding on Earth as well; ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author is saying that if we don't explore Venus now, what will we do in similar situations when the oppurtunity presents itself? To sum up this paragraph, the author supports the idea that we should examine Venus despite the risks by showing Earth needs to expand its horizons.

The third reason why the author wants us to explore Venus is that it has come as close as any planet in our solar system to Earth. In the article, the author calls Venus our twin or our ""sister planet"" what he means by this is that Venus was once very similar to Earth. In the text, it says ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The author tells us that Venus could have supported life at one point. Another piece of textual evidence is ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable,"" the author shows us that Venus would be a prime target to try and explore because of how close it is to Earth. The author is explaining that Venus, being so close, could potentially have alot of crucial information about life.

To conclude this essay, the author supports the idea that we should explore Venus, despite the risks in three ways. By telling us that Venus is our neighboring planet, by showing that we need to expand ourselves and explore, and by telling us that Venus is as close as a sister planet could come. These reasons are how the author supported his idea.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
1CF48E3DD535,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents to humans that even get near the planet. Even with the dangers that are poised against those who would go near Venus, there is still intrigue in the planet from our simple human nature, the opporatunity of studing an Earth like planet besides our own, and the fact that Venus is so close to Earth.

The main reason of studying the planet Venus is capitalized by the article and the author in this quote ""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" The Author also simply puts in the article that humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus all unmanned.

Another reason for the intrigue in studing Venus is our simple human nature. In another quote by the author and in the article ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus beceause it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" the author gives us a reason and it's a reason that makes logical sense. The landscape of Venus is also described in the article as Earth like.

The amount of pressure there is around 90 time bigger than our atmosphere pressure. It is even raining sulfuric acid their. Despite all of these problem they will have to overcome, studying Venus will help us understand things better. For example, one of the things we believe that Venus was just like our planet. Have land, full of ocean, etc. But later something happen to the planet which caused what Venus is like now. If would make a machine that will be able to stand the condintions of Venus, we will most likely understand those things better. Also NASA has an idea to where we would be able to send people there. It would be a blimp like vehicle that would hover above the surface and that would allow us in theory to withstand the ground conditions. But that is only the ground conditions, we would still have extreme heat. But instead of around 800 degrees, it would be around 170 degrees fahrenheit.

Venus and Mars are the closest planets to Earth, but when moving around the sun, sometimes mars is closer to earth than venus and vice versa. Another thing about Venus is that its kind of Earth's twin. Venus is closest to Earth's size and density than all the other planets. But one thing about mars is, its virtually unexplorable. Despite the dangers on this planet, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" wants scientists to go foward into exploring Venus. Here is his evidence in his article that supports him.

Scientists have tried to explor Venus, and have spent millions of dollars on space craft to try to land on it. Those missions had to be unmanned, why though? None of the spacecrafts that went to Venus survived for lots of reasons. Venus's atmosphere is thick and is 97 percent carbon dioxide and is full of clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, also the temperature averages over 800 degrees fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is also 90 times greater than what we feel here on earth. Venus could crush anything and liquefy our metals as well with the hottest surface temperatures in our solar system. Along with all of those factors of stopping the exploration of Venus, there are also earthquakes, erupting volcanos, and lightning strikes. Even after listing all those facts, the author still wants to study Venus.

Scientists are able to study some of Venus while being a safe distence from the planet, but they wont be able to get any fragments of the ground or any samples of the planet. Also, with the dense clouds in Venus's atmosphere, they wouldn't be able to see much of the ground. But, the author thinks they have found a way. Scientists at NASA have been testing out a some new eletronics and puttuing them to the test with similar Venus dangers, and so far they have passed. The scientists are making new technologies stronger to be able to withstand Venus, at least long enough to get what they need to be able to study venus further. I bet the author is happy about that.

This author of this article did not give up on his idea of studing Venus. No matter how many dangerous and deadly things they threw at him, and even the scientists. They never gave up hope of someday exploring venus, and now hopefully hear soon they can give the new information they have gathered from venus to the author. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

In order to get samples of anything researches would have to go to Venus but it's not garented they will make it back to Earth, so they have to come up with a better idea because studying Venus is worth it especially since Venus is an Earth-like planet.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus could be the next palnet there is life on. If the researches discover that life could be held on Venus people could start traveling there and try to research more of the surface of Venus. "" Long ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"" (Paragraph 4). There is a chance of life on Venus so thats why the author states that researching Venus is worthy despite the dangers.

Another way the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despiting the dangers is that many reseachers are woking on making machine last long and doing some testing on them to see if the machines do last longer. "" Many researches are working on innovations that would alow machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"" (paragraph 6). Those machines could study Venus for the reseachers and they wouldn't have to send anyone and risk the dangers.

Exploring Venus is a great idea but researchers should look for other things like machines, or create their own one that could survive the heat and Venus conditions so they don't have to send people and put them in danger because they don't really know what it's like there.

Another reason we should give Venus a try is because it may have harsh conditions and tempuratures but we could find a way around it (paragraph 5).

Venus is one of the most Earth like planets. For example, Venus seems like it was once covered by oceans and a lot of water (paragraph 4). Venus also has features like the Earth like rocky sediment, valleys, mountains and craters (paragraph 4).

5386EFF0884C,"Ever since the dawn of the space age, humans have been dreaming of traveling to our nieghbors in the solar system, Venus and Mars. Great strides have been made in the exploration of Mars. It is quite possible that within the next few years, astronauts will be visiting Mars and and studying the Red Planet in person. Such advances hve not been made in the exploration of Venus however. The environmental conditions of Venus have made it impossible for humans to make on the ground exploation of Venus a reality.

The third paragraph of the article gives a great host of reasons why we should not explore Venus. On the other hand, the reasons to visit Venus are, dare I say, lacking. The author points out the highly corrosive atmosphere, the extreme tempuratures, and the sky high pressure on the surface of Venus. They aslo point out that because of these difficult conditions, noone has ever been able to land even an unmanned spaceship on the planet without it being melted within a few hours.

The evidence to support going to Venus is average at best. The strongest argument given by the author is in paragraph 4 where they say, "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This may be true, but I think the author has still given insufficient evidence for why it would be benificial to explore Venus. It may be possible in the future that new technologies allow us to explore Venus, but for now I think we should wait.

In closing, sometime in the forseeable future, it may be more possible and logical to visit Venus. In our current situation, I think it would be much more benefical to advance our technologies enough to where we can land on the surface and get a close look around. Though we may not have the materials today to withstand the harsh climate of Venus, we should still be inventing and advancing our technologies.

67B4E798A5B4,"The Challengen of Exploring Venus,"" The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presemts.

The author supports this idea. That Venus is actually a planet. in our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun. While Venus is simple to see from the challenging place to examine more closely. Often referred to as Earth's twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in term of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's perputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth; such an eveironment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals.

If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar sytem. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some feartures that are analogous to those on Earth The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features sych as valleys mountains, and creaters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit,a crucial consideration given the long time farmes of space travel. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the optionsfor making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particulry compelling ideafor sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fary. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. at thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperature would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

Striving to meet the Challenge presented by Venushas value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. our tarvels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.",1,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.0
DF0BBE8B6232,"The thrilling concept of touching the stars has always been an endeavour man has striven to accomplish; to understand our world and universe, to reach heights that were once only dreamed of. The author of this article has a similar view. He believes we should do what we can to explore and study the planets and stars, but one planet in particular, Venus. Venus seems a likely choice for many reasons, despite the danger, he provides options of safety, also it's the most practical because it's the closest and quite similar to earth, not only that, but Venus remains a mystery and provides an exciting chalenge that must be overcome. With all this and more the author fully supports his idea that ""the challenge of exploring Venus"" is a worthy one.

First of all, the author acknowledges the fact that it is a dangerous, and quite daunting task. As he says in paragraph 2, ""No spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"".

He fully understands that there will be risk, proving to the reader that this isn't simply a wild idea he just came up with, but that he has done his research and grasps the fact that it won't be easy. Moreover, he furthers his argument by putting forth ideas to increase safety. He mentions experiments and tests that have provided scientists with information to produce electronics and materials able to last longer on Venus's inhospitable surface conditions. These advances will allow scientists to conduct research in order to better understand this mysterious planet.

However, despite any time setbacks concerning development of suitable equipment, Venus has many more practical for our ventures. Venus is- at times- the closest planet in our solar system. Proximity is extremly important where space travel is concerned. It is much more reasonable that we would study and explore a planet that is relativelyl easy to get to. Not only this, but Venus is rather similar to earth. In fact as the article states ""it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". As a reuslt it has sparked much interest and fascination for many Astronomers.

In addition to this, Venus proposes a challenge unlike any other. This is a planet that will not divulge its secrets easily, as is extremely difficult to examine. We mus strive to meet this challenge head-on, to learn all we can about this mysterious, Earth-like planet. The author concludes with a compelling argument that gives his claim more of an edge, he says, "" our travels on Earth and beyond ...should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagintion and innovation"". Humans will be met with challenge after challenge and we cannot scatter at the idea of danger, but rather stand firm and face these difficulties that will lead us to even greater heights.

While this article may have a few faults, the author inspires and excites the minds of curious adventurers who seek reach beyond any limits. He provides reason mixed with ideas that appeal to a readers sense of emotion and supports his claim to a point that they are willing to rise up and meet this challenge like none other.

The author lists the extreme dangers of Venus, and then answers why scientists are so set on exploring it.

The author first regards the dangers of Venus. The author explains the problem to finish with a promising solution.

966FDEB6A771,"In ""The Challenge of Explorig Venus,"" the author does not support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers prevalent on the planet. The author uses poor diction in supporting his idea and does not provide enough evidence for ""why"" but instead provides numerous examples on ""how"" humans would study Venus.

Firstly, the idea of rising up to the challenge to explore a wonderous planet is nice, but the actual rationale behind it unfortunately does not hold the same wonderous value. The author points out in paragraph 4, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth'like planet in our solar system."" Astronomers curiousity of a planet that could have possibly been similar to Earth is not worth millions or billions of dollars which could be used elsewhere. Simple fascination and speculation is not an incentive to spend that type of money. Humans should perfect spacecraft that will be sent into space before shelling out millions of dollars for very little information. The answer seems to be clear. The price simply outweighs the ultimate gain of exploring Venus.

Contrary to what would support the authors claim to pursue further exploration of Venus. He includes various backdraws of exploring the planet. The article states, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degreees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. hese conditions are far more exterme than enaything humans encounter on Earht, such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and wuld liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat. Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.""

All of that mentioned in the paragraph are reasons why humans should not pursue further exploration of Venus. A thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and other toxic gases, clouds of sulfuric acid, an average temperature of over 800 degrees, atmospheric pressure strong enough to crumple a submarine like a soda can, erupting volcanoes, and frequent lightning strikes. So in essence the danger alone should dissuade anyone from even attempting to visit Venus.

The author goes on after his brief reasoning to explore Venus to give an example of how one would explore the planet. He states,""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray... a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape... temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit... Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans... peering from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because mos forms of ligh cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks."" It is presented once again that exploration of Venus would not only be dangerous, but will ulltimately prove unfulfilling in terms of gathering information. The author uses words such as: 'ineffective"" , ""survivable"" , ""not easy"" , and ""limited."" All of which refer to the study of the planet. None of his examples show some sort of positive aspect of exploring Venus.

In conclusion while the author's idea that exploring Venus will give new insight, and better our overall ability to understand space as a whole it is undeniable that exploration of the planet is simply not worth the risks, dangers, and costs presented by evidence in the article.

But with new research and development of technology, slowly we are getting to the point of being able to possibly reduce the risks of a failed mission. The author of "" The challenge of Exploring Venus"" agrees about the rewards of exploring Venus.

There is a fair bit of evidence to support the exploration of Venus, chief among them the proximity to Earth, reducing the amount of time needed to arrive on Venus if we time a launch correcty. The other reason is that there is new research into old technology from the early 1900's to World War II, known as mechanical computers. These machines are simpler than you think though. All they are is a bunch of gears and levers and don't require electricity at all. Considering Venus's hostile conditions, this approach seems well guided in the thought of repurposing and reusing these ancient machines.

All things considered, if these new developments are sucessful, and the timing is right, than we could possibly hear an announcement about a manned mission to Venus. Most likely not tommorrow, but it is possible in our lifetime to hear about this.

It is closest to Earth by density and size. It is difficult to study because it is super hot. NASA is working on a plan to find out more about and explore Venus.

Venus is simular to Earth because they have streams like we do on Earth. They also have said there is a chance of life up there. Long ago Venus was probably covered with oceans. Venus has many things like Earth. They still have rocky surfaces and mountains and craters. Venus is also are nearest option for a planitary visit.

It is dangerous to be on Venus because it is so hot. Temperatures can average over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheric oressure is 90 times greater than what we experience. They could have erupting volcanoes and extreme weather. Another thing they could have is super powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning. They have a super thick atmosphere which could be dangerous to get to.

NASA is trying to find out things about Venus, so we can get new things to possibly go there in the future. NASA is trying to find something that can withstand the heat of it and stay there for a few hours. They could study the life there and find out about it. They want to get close and they think machines will help them do that.

2. The author talks about the facts and history of Venus. He talks about how hot the planet will get and the air pressure. the states that even though the surface can average 800 degrees Fahrenheit but at 30 plus miles above the surface it gets around 170 degrees. This means that humans could be able to study Venus from that level since it's survivable. The author talked about what humans have sent to the sister planet such as probes that didn't last long.

He shows this numorouds times throughout this passege. One that really stood out was when he said that Venus was a lot like earth. It has mountens, vallys, hills and exetra. They said one way we could get closer and see more is if we sdend a ""vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"". I thought that was a smart idea becaue if the ground is to hop to stand on and be on, having something hover over it is a grat Idea.

They also said that Cenus is like our ""sister plant"". They say this becaus it has proven to be one of the ""most Earth-like planer in out solar system"". That is also a cool fact. I also read in the story that Venus is not the closest to the sun but yet it still is the hotest planet. In passage 4 it states,

""The planet (venus) has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar future"". This is a intesting fact, my question to the auther would be , ""Doesnt Mars have rocks and mountens? So, can mars be a sister planet to Earth as well or am I wrong?""",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
88113F26FB12,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it shows how Venus actually is. It tells of how dangerous it is to explore, and learn more about. However, it also explains the importance of knowing about Venus. Here are some of the reasons stated on why it's important to know and learn more bout Venus.

First, it is thought Venus was once more Earth-like. It's believed that long ago it was covered in oceans. Also having features, such as, valleys, mountains, and craters, similar to the ones on earth. This excites and fascinates astronomers working on exploring Venus.

Second, Venus is sometimes our nearest planet to us. Venus, Earth, and Mars orbit at different speeds, causing Venus to sometimes be our nearest planet.

Which is a huge consinderation in exploring it, becaus eof long times of space travel. It is also known as Earth's twin because it is close in size and density.

Lastly, NASA is already working on a way to seend humans to Venus to study. NASA thinks a solution to the hostile enviroment is to let scientists float above the fray. If a vehicle could float above Venus, you could avoid its hostile enviroment. It allows them to stay up and away from danger. Though the temperatures and pressure wouldn't be easy, they would be survivable.

Therefore, exploring Venus is a good idea despite the dangers. We've already put a lot of work into developing plans to explore Venus, plus all the work we've already done to get them information we have. Venus is one of our closet planets, which is good keeping in mind the long time of space travel. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

Like i said Venus is Earths twin. Venus, at some points, is the closest planet to earth. The only exception is Mars becasue all 3 travel around the sun at different times. Venus is our closest and most reliable planetary visit. Its conditions dozens of miles above the surface are rough, but liveable. With temperatures at that height at 170 degrees Fahrenheit, Venus is the closest things we can find to Earth. Meaning at one point Venus was probably just like earth with large oceans and mountains. If Venus was just like Earth back then, there is a chance that there was forms of life on this planet. This make scientist want to go and get sample of the gas and rocks on Venus and try to see if there was life on other planets except Earth.

With Venus surface 90 times hotter than earths 800 degrees, right now it almost seems impossible. Every robot theyve sent to land on Venus has not lasted 2 weeks. This dosent stop NASA from researching and still giving effort to land on Venus. One day, scietnists believe a Venus visit will be marked down in the books.

8.78E+11,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. I agree with this suggestion because I feel that studying Venus could help us find out if there was once life on the planet, considering it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. I know this because the article states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". This means that their could possibly have been life and human-like creatures just like us.

Although it is a difficult planet to study, scientists find it interesting that there is a planet similar to Earth in many ways. In the article, the author states, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus could sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"". This supports the authors suggestion furthermore because although Venus is a dangerous planet, it is sometimes our nearest planet, which means it would take a shorter amount of time to get there. Not only would this be a wonderful planet to explore, but humans are also very curious to find out what is on the planet Venus and what it has to offer. I say this because the article states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"".

45D591EAE2AE,"Many scientist have trouble on learnig more about Venus. It may act like it the brightest light in the sky but it`s not the easiest to study. They have a rough time try to discover it because they don`t have the right materials to study the planet. They have sent numerous spacecraft to the land on this clound-fraped world. All of the spacecrafts that have tried to land has never made it back. They have no evidence on what`s on this planet.

Scientist have tried to discover venus but they fail everytime. Do you think it`s because of how thick the atmosphere is with carbon dioxide? The air on Venus is very different that Earth. It makes it difficult because the clouds are filled with highly corrosive sulfuric acid and the average temperature is 800 degress Fahrenheit. The human body can not survive in that type of weather. The environment on venus would crush a submarine with how hot it is. Scientist compare the pressure and the heat to a erupting volcanoes. Will they ever figure out a way to do more studys on Venus.

As more and more people study Venus,they want to figure out how to get there. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particulary compelling idea for spending humans to study Venus. They may have came up with a idea to float above the fray. They want the vehicle to avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and away from the ground. The temperature would still be pretty hot but not as hot as the ground tempertaure. The temperature in the air would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit but the air temperature would be close to the sea level on Earth. As many people study this idea,they will think that the human body would be able to use this method instead of going on the land of Venus. Could you see this happening in the future or not?

Other researchers think that Venus is to inhospitable to visit. They think that many years ago that Venus was just like Earth but they have no evidence to support the claim. On the other hand,how could Venus be like it is today and it like Earth years ago. Did Venus move that far away for it not to be a living place. The planet is a rocky sediment and has valleys,mountains and craters. I would say within a couple of years,scientist will have enough technology to discovert his planet. Would you ever live on this planet if they discover that it is a living place.

With all the evidence and support that scientist have,can Venus be a safe place to live. I think within the next couple years we will truely know what kind of planet it is. Scientist do a good job on studying the planets and any other things they study. I just don`t understand how it was safe man years ago and not anymore.

8049A1A0A0B2,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is an article written by someone who is arguing that Venus is a worthy exploration, despite the fact that it is highly dangerous. The author's claim was strong, and the points were valid. They included many different supported statements, and facts, and arguments that support their case very well.

Throughout the article, the author gives many different statements that help support their statement that Venus is worth the risk. In paragraph 2, the author discusses all the qualities and characteristics that make Venus an ideal planet to study. Venus is most similar to Earth by means of size and density, and at times, the closest in distance. In paragraph 4, further evidence is put forth. Paragraph 4 discusses the interest scientists have in exploring Venus. It states, "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Scientists believe Venus might have once been covered in oceans, which could have easily supported some sort of life. The author included that evidence to show readers that Venus might hold questions many scientists want answers to. The author wants the reader to think more into the exploration of Venus and all of the positive outcomes it could bring us.

The author supported their statements and claims adequatley. For each point the author made, they they gave factual evidence that backed up their point. Each statement was legitamate. For instance, one of the author's points was made in paragraph 5. The author uses an idea from NASA to back up their claim. It states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" NASA is working on ways to put explorers on Venus, and the author uses that to help further his claim that Venus should be explored, dangerous or not. The author gives so many points and outside evidence that their claim is more than supported.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
7704558907A5,"Venus is one of the brighest points of light in the night sky and sometimes called ""Evening Star"". Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely. In ""The Challange of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursit despite the danger it presents. Three reasons that supports author idea is Venus has dangerous geology and weather , the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere, and the surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

The fisrt reason is Venus present dangerous geology and weather. In Venus, the climate and weather are worst and danger which make nothing to survive. in a paragraph, it said "" Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting vocanoes, powerful earthquake, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface."" This show why it's danger for anything that land on Venus.

The second reason is venus has the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. In a paragraph, it said "" The cloud conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth; scuh as enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" this show how it is dangerous to humans and enviroments.

The third reason is the surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fehrenheit. Also the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than our planet. In a paragraph, it said "" Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system and solar power power would be plentiful, and radition would not excced Earth level."" This support that no one can live on Venus because of the temperature.

So, In "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus, "" The author suggests that studying venus is worthy pursit despite the danger it presents because of this three reasons. Venus has dangerous geology and weather, the clouds of highly corosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere, and the surface temperatures average over 800 degree fehrenheit. Venus is referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" It's dangerous for living organisms to live.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

The author of the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports his idea well by giving details on what challenges Venus gives, reasons as to why scientists are fascianted on exploring the planet, and plausible solutions on how to explore Venus despite the complications.

The author presents details as to why Venus is a challenge to explore by giving descriptions on its envrionment. In paragraph 3, the article states ""...Venus has the hottest surface temperature on any planet in our solar system..."" and ""...planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit..."" These statements provide a sensory detail of why humans aren't able to withstand the conditions of Venus, because it is extremely hot for us to withstand. Another example is, ""...Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This demonstrates the complication as to why spacecrafts have a hard time landing on Venus to explore, which is weather and environmental factors impose a threat to damaging the spacecraft.

The author in the article helps support his idea by giving reasons as to why scientists are fascianted on exploring the planet Venus. In paragraph 4, it states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This examines why scientists are curious on exploring the planet because if it has been the most Earth-like planet it ""...could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth,"" as stated in the fourth paragraph. Another example is ""...Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" This exclaims that since Venus is not that far away to travel to compared to other planets, it cuts down space travel time which is beneficial to humans since they cannot live hundreds of years.

The author continues to supports his ideas by proposing plausible solutions on how to explore Venus despite the complications. In paragraph 5, it says ""... a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" This example provides information on how a hovering vehicle would help astronauts to avoid the environmental factors making it easier to explore Venus by aerial view. In paragraph 7, it states ""Another project is looking back to an old techonology called mechanical computers... these devices make calculations by using gearws and levers and do not require electronics at all."" This example helps exancuate on how old technology can help collect data on Venus by being able to be more resistent to its conditions compare to modern technology that is delicate.

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagnication and innovation. The author highlighted points as to why Venus would be a difficult planet to explore, but expunds on the solutions and inspirations why its a worthy pursuit. The author exclaimes his points by giving details on what challenges Venus gives, reasons as to why scientists are fascianted on exploring the planet, and plausible solutions on how to explore Venus despite the complications.

Now i'm going to state details on the the ways I said the author supports the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. It's earth's twin and how it was much like earth before,in paragraph 4 it says venus was probable covered largely with oceans and how it could of had various forms of life like earh is today. It also says how today Venus still has features analogous to Earth,how the surface is rocky sediment and has features such as valleys,mountains,and craters. And then the author said ""Venus can sometimes be the nearest option for planetary visit.""

Then on how the author likes the ideas that NASA is coming up with to visit earth with what he/she said was a ""compelling idea"" and the machines and devices that their making that the author likes as well. They would make vehicle to float above the fray hovering 30 miles above Venus landscape,it would avoid the badly ground conditions by keeping off it. ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" the authoer said. All of thes details are in paragraph 5.

Then in paraagrph 7 the author said NASA is coming up with a machine made of silicon carbide to work on Venus's surface. It has been tested.

D0E442B88A19,"Humans must continue to study Venus as it is know to be the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. With NASA stating that it is possible to send humans to Venus, we must do it to gather information on how Venus use to be like Earth and then how it became impossible to live on. The author uses logos to inform the reader on how to get a human to Venus. If a human were to go to venus he/she would stay about thirty miles above the surface where it is about 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The pressure is normal and solar power would be very useful. With these conditions it is possible to send a human to Venus.

Although Venus can be accessed by humans, the information scientist really want is on the surface. Sending a human to the surface is death but, scientist are working on a machine made of silicon carbide. The silicon carbide material can withstand the awful conditions of Venus for about 3 weeks. 3 weeks is enough time to gather rocks, dust, gas, and other objects on the surface. All of this information that the author says is building a compeling reason to study Venus.

1ED5037C1462,"In the article ""The Challange of Exploring Venus,"" The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author uses a few reasons to support his argument, but he tends to dwell on the challanges of going to Venus and not the rewards.

First, his first and body paragraph focuses on how it is hard to get the right timing to go to Venus, and how all of our unmaned missions have not made it or not survived more than a few hours. He ends paragraph 2 by saying that it is hard to get the right timing to go to Venus and we have not had a spaceship touch down in more than three years. This is not a good way to start his article becasue it leaves the reader wondering why we would even bother going to Venus. The author makes it sound very challenging from the start and does not leave the reader with much hope for the journey to Venus.

In paragraph 3 the author describes the deadly charectaristics of Venus. He talks about how the planets surface is 800 degrees Farenheit and how the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than are own planet. Then the author gives examples on what those conditons can do such and melting metals and crushing submarines. Once again the author dwells on the challanges of going to Venus and not the rewards. Between the first and second paragraph the author does not build a compelling argument to go the Venus.

In paragraph 4 the author starts to build his argument for going to Venus. He states that it is the most earth-like planet, and it has a surface of rocky sediment that has planetary fetures close to ours. Other than that he does not build a case for Venus that a lot of people would back up. His argument that it si the closest planet in case we ever needed to leave earth is an invalid argument becasue of the state of our tech compared to the extreemley harsh conditions of Venus.

In paragraph 6 the author describes ways that we have tried to research Venuns that haven't worked. In paragraph 7 the author describes possible tech made by NASA that could solve some of the issues Venus poses, but that tech is simply not ready yet. This of the essay starts to make going to Venus sound more feasable, but the technology he is describing is not ready yet.

In the article ""The Challange of Exploring Venus"" the author tries to make an argument for going to Venus. He explains all the challanges and then tries to justify them by the payoff being to settle human curiosity. The article is well written he just makes more of a case for not going to Venus.

231FDA202B25,"Do you remember the space trip to Mars? Well, another debate is brewing: Should we go to Venus or not? There are two perspectives on this issue. They are the people that want travel Venus (the author), and the people that don't want travel to Venus. There are two inherant issues too. They are the need for futher space exploration, and safety. The author has provided enough information on both sides of the argument, but he thinks that studying Venus is a ""worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.""

This first inherant issue, according the author, is crutial. The people wanting to travel to space believe that we need to go to Venus because it is the planet closest to Earth, in characteristics and in distance. There have been attempts to go the Venus, but everytime the spaceship lands it only survives for a few hours. They believe that we need to get up on Venus and study it. There is only so much we can do from Earth, and right now it's not enough. The author has a lot of evidence supporting the need for space exploration such as ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" (paragraph 8) The author beleive that all of the risks he list in the article doesn't matter becayse we need to take risks sometimes.

The first inherant issue, according to people who don't want to explore Venus, is also a vital part of the arguement. They believe that we have already tried going to Venus, it failed, and why try again. They believe that we have enough information from what we can do on Earth, why do we need to know everything in the universe? They believe that we have already found enough information that we need to know.

The second issue is safety. According to NASA, they have a solution for getting a spaceship to Venus carefully and safely. ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" (paragraph 5). NASA has a soultion for the safety issue that was recently brought to their attention. The people who want to go and explore Venus now believe that this is one of the final steps toward actually getting off of the ground. If NASA trains astronauts well enough, tries to simulate the conditions on Venus, and everything works well; there is noting holding them back. The author expresses his support for the innovation NASA invented. The author thinks that this the object of the future.

The second issue, according to the people who want to stay grounded on Earth, is important for both sides to recognize. The people in the second perspective say it is not safe to go to Venus. We have tried it unmanned, and the unmanned spaceship counldn't live there for longer than a few hours, so it is too dangerous. ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth..."" (Paragraph 3). This quote helps support the second perspective for wanting NASA to kept its space ships from going to Venus. As the quote says, Venus is a very dangerous planet.

In conclusion, the arguement is still ongoing, and doesn't seem to have a clear answer. I believe the stasis lies between finding a need for going to Venus, that isn't just the need for exploration, and a proven safe way to get and stay on Venus. The two perspectives are the author and the people opposing the author. The two issues are is there a need for exploaration and the safety of going to Venus. Therefore, with all the evidence provided to you, you can make a clear decision about if you want NASA going to Venus, or if you want NASA to stay grounded, but the author believes that you should side with him in support of Venus exploration.

BA5DDDBE34E3,"The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a well written article about the knowledge we have about Venus. Scientists have been fascinated with the planet's characteristics, such as its weather patterns, orbital route, as well as Venus's geology. Even though we have quite a bit of information about the planet, there are still many things that we do not know about Venus. The author heavily advocates the need of exploring Venus for multiple reasons.

The article mentioned how scientists refer to Venus as Earth's twin. Venus shares a very similar size, density, and distance with our planet. The main issue with Venus is that the weather can be chaotic and unpredictable, as well as the planet's atmosphere and living conditions. However, while those factors may not be ideal, they could still be survivable for humans if we had the propper equipment

Another reason the article states is that Venus could have been the most similar planet to Earth. Scientists believe that Venus might have had large oceans similar to Earth's modern day oceans. This information alone is one of the reasons why scientists want to explore the planet more. We may be able to understand more about Earth's oceans through the possible oceans that used to exist on Venus.

One of the last reasons the author listed was that Venus is one of the closest destinations for us to visit. It will most likely be a long time before any human travels outside of the solar system, but a planet such as Venus would make the most sense to travel to. While it does sound phenomonal to attempt to land on Venus, it would be extremely dangerous to do so. There is nothing easy about traveling in space, and Venus's climate is too unpredictable to even reach its surface.

The article has many pieces of evidence that support the idea of studying Venus. Some of those ideas are currently very dangerous and improbable to even attempt, but they are still very good goals to strive for. The article sheds light on the importance of exploration, as well as the idea that there is an endless amount of knowledge beyond our understanding.

The authors first claim for studying Venus being dangerous is carbon dioxide. The author quotes in paragraph 3 saying ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" Telling how its dangerous and how a human could die from breathing in carbon dioxide. This is important because it tells us the risks you can take if you were to get close to Venus.

The authors second claim why it is dangerous to study Venus are the clouds. He said that in paragraph 3 ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmoshpere."" Also telling us that venus had many dangerous features that can harm a human if they were to go to Venus. This is significant because we should know what we are getting into and know how to prevent anything harmful and study Venus without being harmed.

The last thing the author said aboout being harmful was the heat and the atmospheric pressure being way more extreme than planet earths. He said in paragraph 3 ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmosphere pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our own planet. This is explaining to us how Venus is very dangerous in many ways. this is important for everyone because we should know what is around us either way whether we are learning about it or not.

The author Suggests learning about Venus not only to know it better but for us to discover new path way and to know about our surround planets. But nothing would be learned if no one takes a risk in life to study something new. Like the author claims in the last paragraph no one should be limited by dangers. Everyone can overcome and should learn soomething even if it means risking something you don't want to.   ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
691A1FC1C31E,"The author states that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. How well does this author truly show this? He shows how we can see Venus from afar but we don't know what it is like close up, it's often reffered to as earth's twin which is very important, and we also need to get up close to Venus even if there is risks.

People from earth can see Venus just by looking up at the right place. The author states, ""Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot."" So from afar we can see it as a big ""light"" in the sky, kind of like a star. But Venus is not a star it is a planet. What he means by this is that you can see how bright Venus is from afar but what you can't see what it is really like close up. But if we dont know what Venus is like close up then how do we know it is Earth's ""twin""?

Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"". According to the text ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the clostest distance too."" The passage also states, ""Venus may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" So if Venus is so much like earth then why can't we send a spacecraft to Venus now? Well we tried and it didnt workout. There was a spacecraft sent unmanned because the spacecraft could only survive the landing for three hours. Venus today still have some features that are close to ours on earth. Could this mean it could become safe sometime? Doubtful. According to the passage, ""Venus is a planet that has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters."" So why do we need to get so up close to Venus even though it causes risks?

Wouldn't you like to know whats on Venus even if it could be dangerous? I beileve this is why the author suggest thst Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it precents. You may wonder what thoes dangers are. According to the passage, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" So why should we still go? NASA is finding a possible solution to the hostile conditions. According to the text ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hoveriing 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. A vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground confitions by staying up and out of their way."" It also states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" This means we would be able to see and get more information about Venus.

I conclude that because of all the new findings that this is why the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit dispite the dangers. If Venus is like Earth does that mean that what happened to Venus might happen to us? This is why we need more information. The author shows us how we can see Venus from afar but we don't know what it is like close up, its often reffered to as earths twin which is very important, and we also need to get up close to Venus even if there is risks. These are very important to know when deciding weather it is a good idea to travel to Venus even with the dangers. ",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
E0D79BFFE76A,"The author supports further Venus expiditions because of the insight we would gain from it. However, the author seems to forget that these kind of enviromental hurdels take time and money to jump over. A mechanical computer would have slow the process of gathering intel from Venus's surface. Even though silicon carbide electronics sound more appeasing because they last longer, it costs money to buy the materials and build these devices. Rocket fuel is also a bit pricey as it has to have enough fuel to launch and leave orbit and direct itself to Venus. The engineers and scientists have to be paid as well. The author doesn't have an explaination as to where all the money would come from. Venus will chew through the devices and even people we send there.

The idea of sending humans to Venus sounds dangerous, especially since Venus is a hostile enviroment. Venus has a ground temperature of more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit, as mentioned, that temperature will melt tin. If tin can't survive in that heat, so can't humans. The author brings up the idea of having the scientist float thirty miles or more above the surface. This idea seems legitiment except for one thing. Earlier in the article, the author mentioned that the clouds are made out of highly corrosive sulferic acid. The author does not mention how to overcome that obstacle. How are we supposed to explore Venus further if we can't get the money and we can't find a safe way for humans to explore it?

The author does not have many ways as to how to accomplish exploring Venus. Only radical concepts that would only work in a perfect world. They propose these ideas yet they won't elaborate further on them. Maybe this article was meant to inspire some one else to find out a way to explore Venus. However, The author has many ideas, they just need to exlain them. The idea of float in a zeppline above the surface, how do we do that? They need to go into detail as to how we accomplish these things.

Some solutions that the author stated on what we could do to be able to live there so that we could study it better were that we could build a bimp like vehicle so that it would hover over the planet avoiding all of the dangers. But in doing so would still lead us to the questions how would we be able to get samples like rocks and things that they need to tudy it and he said that scientists today are coming up with solutions that would help us be able to get the thngs we need without having to get out or get harmed.

The author stated that Venus would be very important to study because tht would probably be the first planet that we could ever be able to visit and it would be best if we understood it more.

BB131B5518F6,"Venus is the second closest planet to the sun. Many people would find a planet like this an intersting topic of research to pursue. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is about the planet Venus and all of it's glory. This article is about people who want to explor the planet Venus. They believe exploring Venus is a mission that is worthy to be pursued. This essay will include, the study of Venus, the pursuit in exploring this planet, and the dangers that could occur traveling to Venus.

Venus is known as the Earth's twin because of the density and size of both planets. They both are very alike to one another. Because the two planets are very similar, astronmers are facinated by this thought of traveling to another planet that Earth. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author says, ""These conditions are far more exterme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" (paragraph 3). The author has done research on this topic for some time and he realizes that Venus's atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater. than on Earth. The author finds this planet very different from the planet we live on now. And is far more dangerous and fascinating than other planets.

Many people have done research on this planet because most astronomers want to see this new planet and experience all of its differences. If the astronomers traveled to this new planet, they are predicting that they will be able to survive when going there. The tempeture in Venus will be very ""toasty"" because this planet is very close to the sun and that is one of the variables the researchers are trying to get around to. In this article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it says, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfreindly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" (paragraph 5). In this quote, NASA is trying to find solutions on how to get to Venus in a very safe manner. They know that tempetures will be very hot almost to 200 degrees Fahrenheit, but they asume it will be survivable for humans.

Going on this trip will be very dangerous because of high tempetures and the situation at hand. There are many dangerous ahead in this traveling experience if they proceed in taking action. Travelers believe that it will be an experience that they will not regret and they are excited to learn more about this planet even if it is very dangerous they still want to proceed in this event. In this article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author says, ""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" (paragraph 6).In this quote, the author proceeds in saying that travelers are already too deep into this research that they have already found solutions and they have already thought of occuring problems that they are now trying to fix before they take action. A couple of their concerns are when they are close to Venus, the tempetures will be rising which is a very frightning thought for these explorers. But they are keeping their heads ups and continuing their research and expirementing solutions.

Exploring Venus is a very big task for these explorers. Having this challenge for them is encouraging and everytime they find something new about this planet, it makes them want to keep dipping and finding more new things about this planet. These explorers find joy in this research on Venus and all of the differences when comparing Venus to Earth. These explorers might be going into some trouble when planning on traveling to Venus, but that doesn't matter to them. They want to explor this planet even if it is dangerous or unrealistic. They will keep searching for a reasonable solution for this journey.  ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
F8A5F41218AD,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worth-while task. Although Venus poses many risks to humans and technology, the information and resources that can be taken from Venus are overwhelming.

In the beginning of the article, the author explains the many complications that come along with trying to study Venus. Previously, more than three decades ago, there were numerous attempts to study Venus, but shorty after landing spacecrafts, they were destroyed due to the conditions. This is because of the daunting environment Venus possesses, the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, temperatures can acceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure is 90 times greater than the pressure on Earth. Although these environmental factors seem to be disasterous for almost anything that would dare set foot on the planet, the author decribes two possible ways to get around this delima. First the author describes an idea posed by NASA. NASA says that sending people to Venus is possible, as long as they're above the intense conditions of the planet. They say that hovering at around the height airplains fly in hot airbaloons, humans could uncomfortably survive. Second, simple systems that use mechanical parts, have been proven to last up to three weeks in a simulated recreation of Venus. Theses ""rovers"" could prove useful for grathering test samples that the balloons above the atmosphere would not be able to, also they would be able to take greater quality pictures and study the land more effectively. Scientists say that Venus could have supported life long ago; as well as have similiar aspects to Earth such as: large oceans, valleys, mountains, and craters. According to the author this would prove usefull if similar conditons arose on Earth, and would give us insite about the rest of the universe.

The reward of knowledge that would be yeilded from the daunting exploration of Venus out weighs the risks and complications that would arise. The author supports his argument well and makes a convencing claim.          ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

Also, Venus had an extremely temperatures that humans can't survived.

Years ago scientist fund something interesting in Venus but also dangereous, venus can be inhabit???, how we can travel to Venus???

Also the Nasa do programs to send people to Venus and study the ecosism.

Venus the secund planet of the solar sistem. Scientis fund that Venus maybe can be inhabit, because they fund properties that Earth posees. But now Venus is like pangea, a dangerous planet with dangerous gasees, earthquakes, etc.

and now, the humanity want to know how to lived in Venus.

Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though Mercury is closer our sun you can see, Venus is a worthy pursuit but it also has some dangers.

Venus has some dangers that occur at this planet. Venus is sometimes around the corner and humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Venus is a difficult planet for humans to study. Factors contribute to Venus's reputation. Venus can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering forms of photography and videography ineffective. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. NASA is fixing all of the dangers that are happening in Venus right now.

Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself.

Venus is a worthy/good pursuit despite the dangers that has happened. The value of returning to Venus seem indisputable. Venus presented a value that is striving to meet the challenge.

In the past they have tried to explore it they have sent numerous spacecraft to land Venus. Each of the missions have been unmanned. Since no spacecraft have even survied the land more that a few hours. This explains why exploring Venus could be a good reason or a bad reason. The passage states that they have been succesful in three decades. It is a very challenging plant for humans to study. The atmosphere makes it even worse to travel through it being 97 persent carbon dioxide. The preasure from it is 90 percent worse even on top of that it can reach up to 800 degrees fahrenheit.

They say Venus has value because human curiosity will likely lead into intimidating endeavors. They also say that even though there are dangers here that means that we shouldn't stop what we are doing we keep pushing. They also say beacuse of doubts they shouldn't give up.

0DB652C52A3C,"The author supports his idea by describing Venus in a very well way. In the text the author tell us about Venus and he tell us about how Venus could be, He also says that Venus could be just like Earth. Venus is the most dangerous planet because it has very high temperatures, is the hosttest planet but this p[lanet is important at the same time because is our planet sister. What this means is that Venus and Earth look alike but Venus a more Dangerous and it has differences too.

One reason why Venus is dangerous is because is the hottest planet. In the firts paragraph the author says how bright Venus is, he says that is bright because is closets to the sun, and that it also has a nickname. In the text he says '' Venus sometimes called the ''Evening Star'', is one of the brightest points in the night sky.'' This shows us that he is telling how bright Venus is. The author also says that Venus is actually a planet. In the text it says '' In our solar system, Venus is the second planet from our sun.'' This show us that Venus is a planet, and also how he descibe Venus.

Another reason why on how the author describes Venus is that Venus looks just like Earth. In the second paragraph the author says ''Venus is often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionlly the closest in distance too.'' This show us how the author is comparing Venus to Earth and also how he describe Venus in a very well way. Venus is a danger because is the closest planets to the sun which means that is very hot and it can burned, and damage person very in a bad way or a person could die because of how hot is Venus. In the text the author says '' Since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.'' This show us that Venus is a hard planet to study because of how hot it is the planet.

In conclusion, Venus has almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide and it has clouds of corrosive acid in the atmosphere. In the text it says '' A trick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.'' This show the danger that is in Venus planet. Venus was a very high temperatures. In the text it says '' On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather than what we experience on our own planets.'' This is show us that a human wouldn't be able to survive in Venus because of the high temperatures. If it 90 times greather then the temperature we experience in our planet then i cannot imagine a human, it would literally kill the person.

Venus seems to have had some type intrest to some people such as the author who suggested studying the planet even if it means harming yourself should be acceptable.

The author believes that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus is close to Earth and many don't really know this because Venus isn't talked about as much as it should be. The planet was descibed in the reading and the description seemed like it would may be an good idea to study Venus as it states in the text descibing Venus and I quote "" The planet has a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys,moutains, and craters"" this description gives you an inside view of how Venus looks on the inside.

Although many don't really think about Venus it's a very important planet and the author listed some very good pointers to think about that'll make you want to look more into the planet. The author stated and I quote

"" Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet"" the author believes that Vensus was once like earth and he thinks looking more into Venus can solve some unanswered concerns. There is a maybe that Venus may have had an ocean there as it states in the text "" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" this states that it seems to be life on Venus before. If there was life on Venus before beacuse of what their observing then studying Venus might not be so bad and the author may be right that despiting dangers studying Vensus is a good idea.

Studying Venus after all may not be a bad thing after all. The author gave many details and explained a lot about Venus that some mahy have never known about Venus. Venus is an over looked planet everybody knows of the planet Venus but nobody really knows the history behind the planet. The author explained that Venus seemed familiar and seems as if he's been there before. Venus looks much like Earth as if a human once lived there before as descibed in the passage. It seems like Venus is worth risking something dangerous happening to you just to study it because the author suggested it meaning he's down for what it takes to study this planet the right way.

In conclusion the author suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit shows how committed he is on studying the planet. The author suggested that looking past all of the dangers that comes with studying Venus is a good thing to do because there may have been life on Venus before. If there was life on Venus then studying the planet may give the people studying the planet some good informantion to back up their assumption of human living on the planet long ago.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
A0F89137B3FD,"The author well supports their idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its dangers. They give evidence supporting the importance of Venus's past, its general beneficiality, and how it could positively affect our future.

Exploring Venus is useful because its past is similar to Earth's present state. The passage states that Venus is closest to Earth in density and size, then that ""astromomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" By exploring the planet and its past, more understanding on its inhospitable fall would be known, and potentially used in the research of space travel and comprehension. Since Venus and Earth were so similar, it is likely that at some point Earth will have the same result as its sister planet.

Studying Venus also offers general beneficiality to space research. In the passage it says that Venus is occasionally the closest in distance to Earth. Because the distance is the shortest, the time neccessary to travel to, and thus, get feedback from, is also the shortest. Whether that be general information about interplanetary travel or information specific to Venus itself, the quickness alotted due to the distance is very useful since traveling in space has a very large time scale.

The future of technology and inhabitants on Earth can greatly improve with the study of Venus. By creating technology durable enough to withstand the intense weather and atmospheric conditions of Venus, it could prove to be durable enough for other planets that we could colonize.

However, Venus still have some things which a living beings needs to survive. This planet has a rocky sediment anf includes such a familiar features like valleys, mountains, and craters.

Venus can also conclude as our second option, if we have to choose another place except Earth. But Venus's reputation is a challenging planet for humans to study. Not even a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Sometimes we are closer to the Mars and sometimes we are closer to Venus. This all is because of difference in speed. As Venus is sometimes right around the corner, humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land.

NASA has an idea to send humans to study about Venus. To explain the idea of NASA author has used few examples like blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape. Author also uses jet airplanes as an example as our jet airplanes traveln at a higher altitude to fly over many storms. NASA explains about the temperature and solar power on Venus for survivle of humans. The temperature is around 170 degrees in Fahrenheit, but the air pressure is going to be close to the sea level of Earth. Solar power will be enough and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Conditions is not really easy but enough for the survival of humans.

It's important or it's wothy to study about Venus as this is the only planet on space except Earth where humans can survive.

0B508FD837EF,"Venus is a planet deemed to be the Earth's twin due to their relations in density and size. This has led to NASA sending unmanned drones to Venus due to this intrest in how similar Earth can be to the "" Evening Star."" These facts have led to people such as the author of the article "" The Challange of Exploring Venus,"" to give his thoughts about meeting the challange that the exploration of Venus provides. Using details from the article it is conmfirmable that the author did well while supporting this idea.

At the beginning of the article I was provided many facts about Venus which told me that the author was highly enthusiastic about the planet itself. In his fourth paragraph he began to talk about how Venus had features very similar to Earth such as valleys, mountains, and craters. This tells me that there is still a high amount of interest in the planet despite its amospheric pressure being able to crush a submarine that ventures into the deepest parts of our oceans. By providing these facts despite the obvious danger he provides any reader a sense of adventure and willigness to go beyond what we know is possible, and venture into what we thought was impossible.

In his sixth paragraph the author goes on to state that peering down at Venus can only provide so much information due to a researcher not being able to take any kind of sample from a safe distance. This is all said to support the idea that Venus is a worth pursuit despite the danger presented, along with his final statement that researches are working on innovations that would allow for contributions to our knowledge of Venus. This is the author telling us that though an exploration of Venus wouldn't bring us conclusive evidence or findings currently, that these efforts would allow us to rise above the challanges presented currently. This willingness to expand our knowledge is accountable to how he is supporting his belief so effortlessly.

Before suggesting that a solution can be created the author did speak of a modern solution to our problem. The problem being that we have not been able to explore venus thoughroughly even though we have sent unmanned drones before. This problem is cause by the average heat being over eight-hundred degrees Farenheit and melting the drones metal. Despite this the author provides the idea of flying at a certain altitude that could allow us to avoid the ground conditions and rest a ship thirty miles or more above the prementioned conditions.

He also brings up the fact that the solar power would be plentiful and the radiation woudln't exceed the levels reached on Earth.

In conclusion, the authors willingess to concieve solutions is a clear sign that he has supported his idea very well. He has done so well that even I, the reader, even believe his ideas that we should explore Venus itself. Anyone can spout their ideas or opinions and turn them into a persuasive article. Despite this, it takes more than that to create an article sucha as this that can fuffill its intended purpose and show how much an author cares along with how well he can make an audiecne recieve his idealology.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
83810CEDAE01,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author explained many reasons why studying Venus would be helpful and advantageous to us as humans and scientists. Especially since Venus is the planet most like Earth, this would benefit Earth's knowledge at how we could study and explore Venus and grasp the research it would reveal. In Paragraph 8, the aouthor wrote, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value..."" This quote means that Venus is valuable, yet challenges face the journey.

In Paragrpah 4, the author compared how Venus was like Earth a long time ago. The author described how Venus seemed to possess analogous features to our planet, like valley, mountains, and craters, except the long time frames to Venus are a crucial consideration. "" The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable...,"" though in Paragraph 5 the authour explained how NASA had a possible solution for the problem of traveling safely and Venus's hostile conditions.

NASA introduced an idea of a blimp-like vehicle hovering over Venus; the vehicle would remain floating above Venus's surface to remain away from the storms. Even though Venus has unavoidable dangers, for exmaple, the erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes explained in Paragraph 3, we will come prepared for the challenge.

Paragraph 7 states that NASA is working on different approaches as to how to study Venus so far off the ground. Safe in the hovercraft and away from the high pressure and heat and sporadic lightning strikes, scientists discoverd there was no possible way to collect the samples of rock, gas, or any component of Venus without getting out. The scientists sought to conduct a mission to bust the bubble of safety dispute the risks. Simplified electronics made of silicon carbide were tested to have withstood the chaotic surface of Venus for up to three weeks. Mechanical computers would also serve an important role now, just like in the 1940s, by making calculations with gears and levers that do not require electronics at all.

Overall, the point made across by the author of this passage was that even though studying Venus will definitely bring problems and challenges, there are loopholes and many ways to solve the solutions. Science is worth the risks, especially since it is for our planet and can better our understanding, so finding ways around the problem, and even facing them head on are our only solutions better comprehend Venus, and other planets in our solar system as well.

Well have you ever thought about taking a trip to the moon or just the planet period maybe even studying a planet just for fun? It will cause you to think about the 5 w's first the who, who will be there are there lots of humans just floating around in space? what will it be like, what would it look like? Why did someone create this?

when did everything take place? Why did it take place? Where did everything all begin And what made someone think of this ?

Let's say you studied Venus. Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planted in our solar system. It could be by far the most exiciting plant that you could ever study and the greatest dangerous one too. Beyond high pressure and heat Venus geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. Venus causes many things to corrupt without venus there would be many corruptions in the world. But so does any other planet right? Not every planet is a good planet.

How is Venus tested and when was it discorved ? According to the text,"" Many astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planted in our solar system"" The text also states that "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largelt with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. "" Different plantes have been here for over 1,000 years crazy right, If you was to imagine what life would be like with out planets or gravity keeping everything in check what would we be up to right now. We need these things to survive.

Venus could be the most by far dangerous planet to visit the text says ,"" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". The text also states that, "" On the plantet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This goes to show that if you were able to take a trip to Venus you probaly would pass out or either die because the tempature is not average compared to the Earth's and there's less oxygen.

You might take it into concederation that we should not be limited to on things we want to do just because the danger of things, and I agree because the world be so much better if we did what we wanted. Studying a planet and actually going to see about it could be someone's biggest dream but they are stopped by it because of the outcome.

6B4F37D30E7C,"INTRODUCTION:

venus is a big planet, sometimes is called ""evening star"", is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. In our solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun.

BODY:

Venus is a secons planet with more similarity in our solar system, in terms of density an size and occasionally in distance. venus is a big planet for to go investigate. The atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets venus.

on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greather than waht we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, for example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surfaces and have lasted for three weeks i such conditions. Another project is use old technology called mechanical computers. Just imagine exposing a cellphone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin.

ESSAY:

If you think is good if the NASA want search information about Venus, and end venus is a planet with more silmilarity to the Earth, i think is good but with the genocide atmosphere is so hard if we try live on Venus. maybe just how are the atmosphere or search life in other planets but for live on venus is a big problem.

just live one day or less, or the human body change or some people born different the others. these conditions are not for a human, the human be killed in seconds.

is a big challenge live is this planet, the temperatures are not for humans the clouds are acid and we don't know if this planet has other lifes.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
D85A53759452,"The following essay is an analaysis of the artice ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus."" and an evaluation of the points that the article brings up. The article describes dangers of visting our neighbour planet venus and ideas of how it could be done.

The author does a great job to describe venus as the Earth's ""twin"", but also as a dangerous planet that is not made for us. He brings up that no spacecraft has survived a landing for more than a few hours, that the atmosphere is 97% carbon doixide, that there are clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, that the plantes surface has an average temperature of 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and that the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater as it is on the Earth. All these points convinced me that Venus is a planet that is not made for us to be on. Even if he brings up points why we should still go there it seems to me like it would make no common sense. He says that Venus once looked just like the Earth, but for me it doesn't matter how it once looked like because then we would first go into time traveling and that is not what this article is about. The author also brings up that there could be a survivable soulution by having a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the landscapre. I don't think that this is a good idea, because it would take so much work and money just to see things that we can see without a human being there. He mentions that it probably wouldn't even help the scientists that much because we wouldn't be able to take samples of anything or even inspect the ground conditions. So I think that idea is a waste of money and unless there is a really good reason or something specific to look for we shouldn't do it. The author then mentions that researchers are looking for innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute knowledge over Venus. I think that is a good think to do but it can not be an option to send a human up there, because as long as you only send machines it is just money that you send up there, but with all the dangers it is stupid to send a human to Venus. He closes his article with the statement that we have to strive for new knowlegde beyond our Earth and I do agree with that but we have to look out what the dangers are and sometimes things are not possible, because we are very limited compared to the power of the universe.

So I think that we should keep looking for new innovations that can help us explore the universe but we have to accept that we are very small in a big universe and that not everything is possible for us because we are limited, while the universe is not.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
9E3A8C69E462,"Venus is the most dangerous planet for humans venus we can be fasinated by things that people discover and share with others . The most challenging clouds highly corrosiive sulfuric acid in venus atmophere.

The author uses theory to assure that we can learn more about the planet and the things they have like what kind of rocks they.

Throughtout the planet venus the most dangerous planet for humans to live on no animals would survive the conditions venus is in. Venus is important to study for if its still safe for humans to live and how long we can live for,"" The national Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the roiling Venuisan landscape . That NASA wants to have scientist go to venus and study the planet in the air but not on the ground just floading in the hostile weather condiitions. Another example of why the author wants pursuit Venus despite the dangers presents. Having enough energy can help scientist understand that venus has a higher temperature to that would effect humans not neeeding radiation for earth,""

At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to the sea level on earth. Solar power would be plentiful and radiation woukd not exceed earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable survivable for humans . That since Venus temperature is higher but has plenty of solar power humans can survive despite how badly the conditions are in.

Secondly The author uses explanation and theory to persuade the readers how we can still explore the planet carefully.

Scientist are willing to study Venus for to test samples of the planet,"" More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Scientist want to study things but can't to risk everything to have samples and challenge their selves on this journey understand what kind of species live their. Venus is our sister planet from earth why its so inhospitablethat we new for so long, "" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably coverd largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,

Just like earth. Wondering what if Venus has still have the features of having land water animals from a long time ago.

Finally scientist are coming up with ideas that can help thrmj get samples that they need striving to meet the challenges presented, For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Having robotice go first collecting samples for three weeks that can last that long on the planet so scientist can study it from their labs. Another study is that they are looking at other options for robotics to last longer than three weeks,""

Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanucal computers these devices were first envisioned in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940s during World War 2 these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. That a group of scientist are looking at technology leading back in 1800s because using the old might help because it doen't envolve electronics when using computers today it more delicate when it comes dangerous conditions.

The author is write they should pursuit Venus despit how dangerous it is good thing to have a risk at. Something having exploreing something new and dangeours even though it comes at a cost of things we can go back look at old technology thst can help us get the things we need.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
F5DCF03AC48B,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents and supports this idea by stating in paragraph 8, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This statement supports my claim by explaining how the author believes no one should let the fear of the dangers that may arise stop them from exploring the world and beyond. Instead the author believes people should go after whatever they want to find. Paragraph 8 also states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This evidence explains how the author feels that there will be scary and intimidating obstacles that will arise on the journey of exploring the planet with the hottest surface tempurature in our solar system, but the author believes the curiosity of humans leads us to danger. The author also believes that danger shouldn't stop anyone who is curious from exploring. This article may talk about serious dangers, but also gives ideas for humans to study Venus without being put it any danger. The author states in paragraph 5, ""NASAs possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" This solution may prevent any harm to humans who want to study this planet and learn more about it. This solution gives people a chance to stay curious, and not think about the dangers. Only think about the journey and mystery that lies ahead. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
05F5893A675F,"Exploring another planet may be fun, but how would you like to live in a different planet? Venus is the second planet from the sun, but it's hard to study this mysterious planet because of the different risk that may be on the planet. Many people have tried to visit this planet but had no success. The reason of not accomplishing this goal is because of the many dangers that are within the planet. Although it may seem fun to go study another planet, some may consider it to be a major risk due to the fact that: It's a new planet with no knowlage of knowing what might happen, high or low tempretures, and challenges that may come to getting to know this planet.

Many scientist sent numerous spacecraft to Venus but unfortunetly none has maintaine to last the newly planet for more than a few hours. In the text it states, ""Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, ph.2). However, people may ask why vist this planet, we have other planets that are more closer. Well studies have shown that Venus is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In the text it states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, ph.4). So, the only difference of the Earth, and Venus is the tempreture they have.

In any planet, you don't happen to know the tempretures in the planet. Many plantes have high or low tempretures, and some may even have toxic air for us humans. In Venus the air is mostly made up of carbon dioxide and corrosive sulfuric acid. In the text it states, ""97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" and ""Clouds of highly corrosive sulfic acid in Venus's atmosphere""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, Ph.3). Wanting to go vistit another planet is meaning having to wear special gear so you dont get sick due to the different air it has from Earth. Furthermore, the text also states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus, Ph.3). Having high degrees is very dangerous for us humans, especially if we've never encountered this problem here on Earth.

Austrounots are very brave people, they do all these studies for us so we could understan how another planet functions. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) do send humans (Austrounots) to go study Venus, but they don't particuarly land on the planet. In the text it states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostlie condition on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This motion is leting the humans hover over the planet and it helps protect the people from any harmful ground conditions by not touching the planets surface.

In conclusion, it is fun to study another planet, yes it may seem harmful but in reality the NASA people do know what they are doing and yes they will watch over you and protect you. They  ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
5A8A4C67D1E7,"Although there are many challenges to face in exploring Venus, the biggest one is ourselves.

We have let our imagination overtake what we want.

we can imagine crazy, bizard things; but that does not mean we can have them.

And once we let our imagination take control, we lose.

We lose what we actually want and trade it in for what we can imagine and know we cannot have.

But our imagination is not the only thing getting in the way.

Exploring Venus is a very risky task.

With temperatures higher than 800 degrees Fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure ninety times greater than anything we can ever experience on Earth.

The real question is, ""Is exploring Venus worth the risks?""

Well of course it is!

Every single thign we do has its risks, but that does not stop us from doing things.

We should not turn down an opportunity to explore the great universe we live in simply based of hardships.

Just becasue it is hard does not mean is it impossible.

Venus is the closest planet we have to ourselves.

In paragraph two, Venus is reffered to as '""Earth's 'twin'.""

Venus is the closest thing we have to know what our Earth may or may not turn into.

It is the only thing we can compare ourselves to.

If the conditions on Earth turn into those of Venus, exploring Venus only brings us life.

We can not take away life just because it gets hard!

The fact that it is hard is what should be pushing us to keep exploring.

There is so much we can learn from Venus that we do not even know and probably will not be able to comprehend.

So that is why we need to explore Venus.

We need to explore so that we can learn more about the place we live and the places around us.

Venus is our neighbor, we need to know that our neighbor is safe.

If we do not protect Venus, we are not protecting ourselves.

Through all of the hardships and dangers, we need to keep pursuing to get to Venus.

The more we learn about Venus, the more we can compare and contrast and see if the conditions on Earth are anything like those of Venus.

If we give up on our neighbor, we give up on ourselves.

Venus deserves to be explored and we, as a nation, deserve the chance to explore it.

75C0309D2EA9,"The planet Venus is inhospitable at its current state, but is it worth it to find out the truth? Scientists tell us that Venus is averaging temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times greater than Earth's. Venus has been unexplorable due to these factors with the last mission failing in a few hours, but is it worth the risk? The idea of pursuing Venus is dangerous, but can be worth it to find more about how the geography was similar to earth, and if Venus could ever support life again.

Venus is called Earth's sister planet because it is the closest planet to Earth in density, size, and distance. Humans have tried to explore Venus many times in the past but have all failed due to the intense temperature and pressure of the planet. The planet also has a thick atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide which makes it even more challenging to visit. Despite these factors, why do scientists want to visit this deadly planet? Scientists are very infatuated with this planet because it used to be just like earth from a geography standpoint. The planet was covered with large oceans, rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. These are more than enough reasons for scientists to explore Venus because they want to learn more about what occured for the planet to transform from the earth like place. Scientists need to learn more about Venus so they can learn more about our planet too. They are working on ways to observe the planet while being able to come back alive. NASA has developed an interesting idea to send humans to study venus. They want to study Venus by hovering above the planet just like planes fly over storms. This idea would keep humans away from the harmful things Venus has to offer, but there are some down sides to this idea. Observing Venus from above can only do so much for us. Light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, so insight into the ground life of Venus is limited. The biggest down side is the fact that researchers cannot take samples of Venus such as rock and grass back to earth to study. This idea is still better than nothing because anything we learn from this mission is something we did not know before.

The age old question that most people have on planets is ""could they ever inhabit life again?"" Scientists have studied planets for many years and have seen a variety of things. They have concluded that Mars will be able to inhabit life and have started a program where sign ups are available to leave Earth to help scientists conduct an experiment for life. Venus once held many characteristics similar to earth, but the most important one is that many years ago Venus could have supported a variety of life. The question is what changed? Venus has very hot temperatures and high pressures so it is difficult for scientists to get up close and take samples to study. Scientists are working on different ways to study Venus where they can get closer to take samples. NASA has used some simple electronics made of silicon carbide and simulated it in the chaotic conditions of Venus and it survived for three weeks. This is important because they can use these electronics to send them into the atmosphere of Venus and take pictures and samples from the planet until they find an alternate solution to getting humans past that thick carbon dioxide atmosphere. Scientists also thought of reverting back to mechanical computers to go into the atmosphere. This could work because things that use mechanical parts tend to do better in conditions of high pressure, heat, and other limiting factors. These things could be worth it to the people of Earth because if we determine a way to put life on Venus, the whole world would change.

The idea of Venus' geography being very similar to Earth's and the fact that it could have supported life makes it worth it to study venus despite the dangers that come with it. Venus used to have oceans. mountains, and valleys just like earth, but have no idea what happened to all of those things which make them want to study the planet even more. Life could have been supported long ago and scientists are working to discover a way around the limiting factors to figure out if it could ever be supported again.

The reasons for me supporting the idea is because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system which has fascinated astronomers, and it can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.

One reason is it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. For example, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. This means that Venus still has some features that are analogous to the planet Earth.

D578A055AF5A,"Hello, today we shall be explaining why Venus is worthy. It's like Earth it's also slightly closer, 'cept for the fact it rains actual acid, plus the the tempature is to high. But that doesn't stop the scientist from checking it out! So let's check it out!

Venus has really powerful 'eathquake', it has weather, volcanoes. I mean it does has similar characteristic with Earth. I do understand why the scientist would try to land spaceships, even I would wanna know what Venus holds. Venus has a rocky area. That means is has familiar places like valleys, moutains, and craters.

I don't think it would be something anyone could live on but it doesn't mean in the future they won't try, everything is possible if you believ you can do it. Nothing should stop you, except for the rules, like the rules we bid by -- not the ' Golden Rules', don't get me wrong. I don't want to have anyone against me thinking I'm ""crazy"".

I have no religion, I have nothing against anyone. I do believe in evolution. Back to my conclusion. Scientist, NASA, will still check the planet, they might be checking it to see if life is able to grow, they also think that there could have possibly been water on the Venus once before, ages ago. I think they should continue thier search, continue their theory, and try to succeed with their dreams finally coming true.

BFCB0275C205,"The author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, because in the reading, in paragraphs 2,3, and 4, talk about how Venus is relateable to Earth and that Venus is right next to Earth. In paragraph 2, it talks about how the density and heat of Venus and how there were some spacecrafts that have been sent to Venus, but have only lasted for a short-time. ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" (paragraph 2, sentence 5.

In paragraph 3, it talks about how the heat is so intense that in the third sentence it states, ""On the planet's surface, temperature average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmosheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experince in our own planet.""

In paragraph 4, they relate how Earth is similar to Venus, and how they thought that maybe Venus was our long, long, long, time ago planet.

So with all of this being said, I personally feel that Venus is worthy to study on, and who knows, maybe in our future lives, we may even have some type of opportunity to go and have a visit. All of this really fascinating because I didn't know that Venus is really hot. Even if Venus is dangerous is some way or another, those dangers will go away soon and to give NASA a chance to actually land on Venus.

BB8B609FE966,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" The author suggets that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. The author gives us a lot of information of Venus. Also, the author tells us why its so worhty. The first reason why its worhty to sutdy Venus would be because numerous of factors contribute that venus is a challenging planet for humans to study. The second reason is that in the article the author mentions that in ""venus is sometimes around the corner -in space terms-humans have set numerous spacecraft to land on his cloud-drapped world"" Lastly the author mentions that the NASA is compelling an idea to send humans to stufy in venus.

In the article when the author mentioned that it's a challenging planet to study would be because in our solar system venus is the second planet from our sun and Venus is actualy a planet. Venus is one of the brightest points in the night. Also another reason why venus is so hard to examine would be because it's occasionaly the closest to earth. Another challenging reason would be that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet. Therefor these reason add up doesnt seem like a safe place for humans to study

The second reason why the author suggets that studying Venus is worthy would be because the author mentions that it's right around the corner in space terms each have been unnamed, and for that reason no spacecraft has survived the landing more then a few hours. That tells us how Bad the planet is now imagine sending a human. Despite of the things that has happend the author makes a conclusion that maybe thats why no spaceship has touched down on Venus in more of three decades. If you think about it if a spaceship hasn't touched down there now why would a human want to.

Lastly , the biggest detail that came from the article was that NASA is woking on other ways to study venus. The reason why it stood out the most was that if the author why lying about it being so worhty then I dont think NASA would waste time on this project. NASA has some simplified electornics made of silcon carbide and they have tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of the Venus and it has lasted while being in good conditions. The athor also mentioned that NASA has much more projects in order to be able to study Venus.

In conclussion after reading the artcle the author has given enough information on why the author belives that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The way the author described Venus would be that it isn't a happy or chill place to be at but the author did point out that it's very challenging and awarding planet to study.

Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has tpuched the planet venus in three decades. A thick atmosphere almost 97 percent caron dioxide blanket venus. As of today Venus has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The planet venus has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and creators.

Peering at Venus from a ship orbitin or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography. Researcher cannot take samples of rock, gas or anything else from a distance.

Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

Venus has a chalenging atmospher, but that wont stop people from trying to go there.

Venus is worth pursuing despite the danger it presents because it could tell humans more about the Earth, human cerosity will drive people there eventualy, and people know little about what is below the dence atmosphere.

Venus could give us as humans a greater understanding of Earth.

Venus is Earth's sisster planet.

This means that Venus is about the same density and size as Earth.

The author also states that Venus could have been coverd in water and supported some form of life.

Human cerosity will drive us to Venus at some point.

7612EF65B091,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author's main purpose is to suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author excells at backing up his claim by providing benefits of traveling to Venus, the dangers that it comes with, and how NASA has strived to make traveling there possible. The author does well at supporting his claim that traveling to Venus has value because scientists are aware of the dangers that are presented.

The author initially gives background information about the planet Venus and transitions to the factors of Venus that are dangerous. For example, the author says that Venus has ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide"" and ""clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid."" The author continues giving specific challenges by saying that Venus's temperatures ""average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience."" Lastly, the author explains the geology and weather dangers such as ""erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes."" The author provides these specific dangers in the article to show the readers that scientists are aware of the challenges they must deal with so that they are prepared.

Although the author presents these numerous challenges of Venus, the author does a fantastic job of immediately explaining why it is worthy to go there. For instance, the author explains that Venus ""may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" The author gives evidence of this claim by saying, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,"" and that is was ""covered largely with oceans...and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This evidence provides the readers with benefits of learning more about Venus. Furthermore, the author also explains that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it could ""be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" The author does execellent at supporting this idea and even gives evidence that this is not a fantasy.

The authors's claim of Venus being a worthy pursuit is realistic because the author provides ideas that NASA has developed to safely travel there. For example, the author gives evidence that NASA has worked on allowing ""scientists to float above the fray."" The author provides specifics of avoiding these risks saying, ""...the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."" This evidence supports the author's claim that scientists have taken serious consideration to study Venus.

In conclusion, the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it is the most similar planet to Earth, so they should learn more about it. The author also includes the numerous factors that are dangerous when visiting Venus.

While the author maintains to cross his point, he uses evidence and facts to change the readers' ideas of this messy planet, by comparing it to more similar terms that are more pleasent to the reader.

First the author starts by explaining and describing the unabitable conditions of the planet. The author states that ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth;"" Which are refering to the extreme temperatures of ""average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and the ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percentage carbon dioxide blankets."" Second he follows to counterclaim his points by questioning, ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing fursther visits to its surface?"" This persuades the reader to question themselves, What is so bad about Venus? or more important What is so good about Venus? Which he replays and answers by comparing, once again, Venus with our own planet, Earth. He states that, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Changing the reader's idea or previous image, that he already provided, passing from an ""inhospitable planet"" to a planet that ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life.""

In conclution the author crosses his point by using evidence of a very dangerous, and unabitable planet, and what it once was and how similar it was to what is now our Earth, or also ""Venus' twin.""

02F578DD1D0B,"Venus is said to be the most earth-like planet in our solar system. There are however many things that Venus makes it challenging to be studied or understand. That is just one of many very well told reasons in the article that the author provided to state why we should keep studying Venus despite the dangers it presents. THe author provides information that pushes people to want to know more.

In the article the author provides us with information on the ways how humans have studied Venus. In the the article the author tells the reader how humans have sent a lot of spacecrafts to study Venus but no spacecraft survived for such a long time on just landing on Venus. The author expalins that that is the reason to why no furthur studies have been made in over three decades.

Another thing of information that the author provides the reader with is to why the atmosphere is challenging for us. In the article the author provided the reader with information like the degrees and pressures of the atmosphere. In the article it is said to be over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atomspheric pressure is 90 times greater than the pressure on earth. Also on the discovery on the thirty plus miles abover surface tempatures change to 170 degrees and the pressure changed close to the sea level on earth giving the impression that its survivable for humans. This discovery make scientists want to know more on why that is the case, leading them to keep making new discoveries no matter the challenges it brings them.

The last thing the author provides its readers is with imformation on what NASA is working on to know more about Venus. The author states how NASA is working on different approaches to studying Venus. They are working on simplified electronics which some have in fact worked and have lasted for three weeks. It has studied and has gathered more information.

The author states many information for the reader that supports to why the idea of studying Venus is worthy of pursuit, the more interesting information she provides the more the reader would want to know. The reader would think it is worthy to pursuit to get more discoveries and know the planet further more. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
7146E1352BD8,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author presents the opinion that Venus is well-worth exploring, and well-worth the challenges that humans would have to face to pursue exploration. The author does a great job of explaining why Venus ought to be explored. They also do a pretty good job of explaining how we can explore Venus by bypassing the dangers and risks involved. However, the author does not do a good job on explaining why what we learn on Venus can help humanity. This shows that the author does overall, a nice job of supporting the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit, although they could have done better.

The author uses many points to explain why Venus should be explored. They state that Venus is the closest planet to our own, and that because of its close proximity to Earth, several spacecraft have been sent to the planet already (although all were quickly destroyed). The article also states that Venus was once Earth-like and could have possibly supported life-forms. ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and caters."" In addition to providing this piece on how Venus is still similar to Earth, it also states that Venus may have once also harbored oceans. All of these key points help the author show why they believe humanity and NASA should continue our pursuits on Venus.

The author also does an exempliary job of descrbing how humanity can continue its pursuits on Venus. Although the pressure is intense and the temperature more than any human could handle, there are still ways we can get close to Venus accoding to the author. They describe that using a blimp-like vehicle, astronauts and scientists studying the surface can float safely 30 miles above the surface, where the pressure and heat are much more tolerable. Another solution the author presents gets us much closer to the surface. Although humans wouldn't be able to physically be in vehicles such as this, but old-fashioned computers could be used to help remotely control a probe. These old computers use gears and levers to make calculations, not electricity. As the author puts it, ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme conditions."" These other computers can withstand much more, and could help create a probe resistant enough to study the Venusian surface. The author does a great job at explaining and exploring the possibilities.

However, the author is a bit off the mark when it comes to explaining why what we find on Venus can help humanity out. Although it states what we can find on Venus, and how it is Earth-like and the planet closest to Earth, that doesn't explain why we need to waste resources exploring such inhospitable territory. Venus is in fact Earth's closest neighbor, and our nearest option for a planetary visit, but why would we need to visit it in the first place? Venus may have once been simliar to present-day Earth, but why does that matter to us? How would a study of Venus's surface prove instrumental to NASA and the world? The article states, ""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable..."", but besides the fact the they state that it is Earth-like and closest to us in our solar system, they do not back this claim up at all. The author does a poor job of backing up the benefits to exploring Venus, and cannot defend why we should travel there to any benefit of humanity.

In conlcusion, the author does a decent job of defending his/her claim that Venus should be explored, although it could have been much stronger. They do a fantastic job of explaining why Venus is so unusual and how we can explore, but neglect to provide any benefits or reasons why exploring Venus is so important to the human race as a whole. However, even though the author did not include this in his/her article, it is still a decent article and is (mostly) thorough on why and how to explore the second planet in our solar system.

The author shares that, since venus has one of the closest orbits to earth, It will save on travel cost (Challenge, 2). This is based in fact the fuel cost to even get a rocket of of the earth is astonomical, to enter a steady orbit around venus that will drive the cost up even more. however that cost will still be a lot cheaper than if

NASA shot for jupiter or another planet further away in our solar system.

The author goes on to say what NASA plans are to support a scientists life above the surfice of venus. He says ""A blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the above the rolling Venusian landscape. just like our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way"" (Challenge, 5). the Blimp-like vehicles can possibily support a human living on it for a few months while staying out of the way of the storms.

Venus may be inhospitable now, but it was once the most Earth-like planets in our solar system. In the article it discusses how Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. It states that, ''The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features [like] valleys, mountains, and craters.'' Meaning it has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. Venus is also the second planet from our sun.

Earth, Venus, and Mars orbit the sun at different speeds, which could lead to planetary visits. ''The differences in speed mean that sometimes we ae closer to Mars and other times Venus.'' Humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and no spacecraft survuved the landing for more than a few hours. Venus has proven to be a very challanging place to examine more closely.

There are inhancements that NASA are trying to improve for differnt approaches to studying Venus. The author exclaims, ''A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.''

An example of what NASA is trying to do is to create simplified electronics made of silicone carbide that have been tested to in a chamber that stimulates Venus's surface; this electronic has survived three weeks in such conditon.

Overall NASA has it all figured out they just have yet to try this experiment.

In conclusion there are many benefits to going to Venus like human curiosity will finally be answered. Another benefit is that the scientists and astronomers get to verify if it is really like Earth and maybe get the things they need to be able to visit the planet.

Because of it's rough conditions, it has brought many challenges to scientist, but despite them all, many people believe that Venus is worthy the pursuit.

Venus has been know as the Earth's ¨twin¨ for many years. It has many harsh conditions such as the temperature, atmospheric pressure, and clouds that contain sulfuric acid. These are conditions that are far too extreme for any human to handle. According to the passage, ¨, such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our ocean and would liquefy many metals.¨( Paragraph 3). If such hard conditions, why would scientist even want to go to Venus? With powerful earthquakes, erupting volcanoes, and frequent lightning strikes, how would this benefit human science?

According to the author of ¨The Challenge of Exploring Venus¨, astronomers are facinated by Venus because at one point in time, it was probably the most similar planet to Earth. Scientist believe that Venus was once covered by large oceans that could have supported numerous life forms remensient to Earth. From the information we have gathered, Venus has similar surface features to Earth, such as valleys, craters, and mountians. The questions futher about future missions to Venus- how can astronomers construct a plan that will safely bring humans back home while receving worthy information?

NASA has been trying to solve this problem for a long time. They have found possible soultions such as making devices to have astronuts float above the planet or even upgrade old technology that could with stand these harmful conditions. The author of this passage gave other ways that they are trying to solve this problem. One way would be having some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that would be able to stand strong in Venus' environment. The author says that this would be a good subsitute for humans because not only has it lasted 3 weeks in chamber stimulations, but we can still gather useful information that scientist can use to make valid objections.

The world we live in is nothing compared to the universe that we live in. Humans have adapted to the earthly conditons that have surrounded us from the begging of time.

The author uses many pieces of ecidence that states that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The first piece of evidence is that well us as humans have this thing in our DNA that wants to survive longer. We want to explore whats mysterious, we want more, we want it all. Venus is a way of ""if we can find a way to make it survivable for humans, extinction for our species will be nearly zero."" This paragraph is more of my piece of evidence but the author was inching towards it at the last paragraph of the passage.

The passage stated that long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. Which sounds a lot like Earth. So if long ago, this place was sustainable, then that just gives us motivation that we might be able to actually do this. The second piece of evidence that the author uses to state Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is NASA might be working on a project that involves a blimp-like vehicle hovering around 30 above Venus. This project if suceesful can possibly be the first big step for actually landing on Venus even with its harsh conditions.

The last piece of evidence is that solar energy or power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. These may not be the easiest conditions but it is survivable for humans. We still cannot take samples of rocks, gas or anything on the surface of Venus. This is just another challenge that we will overcome sooner or later.

5B579A31EE23,"Making new discoveries can be hard at times. Especially if there are a lot of obsticles that are in the way, it can be quite difficult. We have an entire universe to discover, such as planets that can be further looked into. The planet Earth has two planets that are very close at times. One of which we already have looked far into so why not look into the second planet that is closest, Venus.

Venus is a planet that we are able to see from Earth, even if some of us aren't professional stargazers. This planet is very close to us at times and is why it can be somewhat easy for us to see. From what we have been able to see from this planet, is that Venus is a, ""cloud draped world."" As we have looked father into it, NASA can tell that there are mountains, valleys, craters, and also has rocky sediment. The look of Venus has similar things as Earth does. The way that Venus looks, it seems that it would a cool and different place to live.

With every good thing comes a bad thing. Venus looks like it would be a good place to live but also has some flaws. The spacecrafts that have gone have been unmaned. It's good that they were because Venus gets very hot. Although Mercury is closer to the sun, Venus still gets hotter. The reasoning for this is because of all the gasses that are surrounding it.

Having another planet that we could be able to go to would be extrordinary. With technology always evolving, I have no doubt that we will be able to visit Venus one of these days. Since we are always evolving, we could find ways of being able to go to Venus despite the dangers. If NASA has been able to go to Mars, then in a matter of no time we should be able to go to Venus. Venus could be the second Earth, we are twins in terms of density and size.

I think that what the author was stating in the passage could really be put to use. Even though there might be a few flaws along the way, I think that we would be able to go to Venus if we kept persuing it. If NASA is always looking into new ways of spacecrafts going to Venus, they could find a way for the spacecraft to safely go there. After that then they could look into more things on Venus and make new discoveries. Venus would be a great idea to keep persuing.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
D2BF0D341FEF,"Not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades! Have you ever wonder why we know so little about Venus and more about Mars?

Whicn resulted on the spacecraft survinving the landing for more than a few hours.

But also because human's curiosity will likely lead us into many equally as statend in (pragraph 7)

In conlusion, we should study Venus more because it will help us learn new information. Also because it's a like earth a lot they both have same density and size. And it's also the closest distance to Earth, but most importantly we should study it because it might make us discover something new like a creature pobrably and might be able to discover new rocks. If scientist do decide to send a spacecraft to Venus it might take decades to do that find out about Venus or find a way to make the landing last longer.

As poeple start to brainstorm about the planets in our solar system, we have noticed Venus, our sometimes closest planet. The passage mentions many ideas on starting life there and what it would take. The author explains, in a nonbias way, why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite dangers because he lists the dangers and risks as well as the reason why we should look into emploring the planet.

He mentions the early life of Venus and how it was similar to Earth in many ways. The author says ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.""( TCOEV, 4) The author mentions the landscape structure of both planets today, metioning the similarty in rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. The author mentions the similaries with a sense of hope for humans to start looking into moving to Venus for a new home. The passage also mentions the disctance factor considering travel time, given the fact that it is near us.

Risks and challenges for this idea are also metioned by the author. The author mentions the clouds and the 97 percent carbon dioxide that blankets Venus. The surface of the planet, as mentioned in the passage, has an atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what we have here on earth. The surface of venus has the hotest temperature compared to any other planets. These and many other conditions aren't conditions that human life can withstand.

The pros of emploring the planet are also portryed. The reader is given hope by mentioning NASA's approaching to the planet. NASA would like to allow their scientists to ""float above the fray"" thirty miles above the planets surface. It is mentioned that the conditions humans would have to go thorugh may be rough, but survivable. Though providing insight of this planet would take challenges scientists are willing to take the risk.

The author mentions the pros and cons of the reasons why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit even after the many dangers metioned in a non-bias way. The author provides the reader with their own option to generate their own opinion given the facts on the dangers and the postive view on going to the planet Venus. Although moving to another planet may seen crazy to some, others think that it is something we should start to consider.

The National Aeronaustics and Space Administration (NASA) is thinking about to send humans to Venus, many researchers are working on innovation that would allow our machines to have knowledge of Venus. Venus is the closest in distance and neighbor of the Earth and Mars even that, the pressure is 90 times greater than the any preassure of the Earth and that Venus's temperature is around of the 170 degrees but the air pressure would be close to the sea level on Earth.

His idea is not supported all that well. He used more of what he thought than facts.

This qoute supports my idea because how does he know that there is insight to be gained on that plant. With that how does he know that human curiosty will lead us to equally endeavors. He needs to uses sources and support his sources. He even goes back to the dangerous that each one can lead to. He does not stay strong in just one idea, he circles back to the other idea.

In paragraph 8 it says that the natural human curiosity will always lead us to discover new places even if we know theres risks. it states in the paragraph that ""but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally inyimidating endevors."" we will always be looking for challenges and solutions with explorations and many other things. Also in paragraph 8 it states ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself."" This proves theres valuable informations we can learn about Venus despite the risks.

Venus at one time was also the closest thing to earth. In paragraph 4 it says ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" this is a worthy persuit because we can discover many things like how did it lose its water, did it used to have life, what event made it unhospitable, etc. To further more go into it the author says, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Getting to know more about Venus could possibly let us know more about Earth itself.

Lastly in paragraph 5 it says even NASA has hopes of discoverying new things about mars and maybe being able to get man on another planet. tThis would be huge for mankind.

Like in paragraph 8 saying the natural human curiosity wil always push us to discover new things no matter what. Or in paragraph 4 that Venus was the most like Earth at one point of time.

Some examples of these are, how close Venus is from the sun and how it is very similar to Earth. Also Venus may have had forms of life on it. The author gives examples for each one of these claims and how they would give a positive effect. These are just a few reasons we should explore Venus and figure out more about it.

The first reason to learn more about Venus is how close it is from the sun. One example for this is when the text states,""Venus is the second planet from our sun."" Which means that it is not very far away from earth. Another reason to study Venus is how similar it is to earth. An example for this is when the text states,""Venus is the closest planet to the Earth in terms of density and size."" A final reason is that Venus may of had forms of life on it. Evidence for this statement is shown when the text states,""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This statement shows how Venus could have been very, very similar to earth.

In conclusion the reasons for exploring Venus include how close it is to the sun, how similar it is to Earth, and how it could have supported life forms long ago. Yes, it is very dangerest because of high temperature and pressure. But if we come up with a way to lower the temperature and pressure it will be surely worth the work put in.

Also Exploring Venus may be exciting but also dangerous because of it thick atmosphere of 97% of carbon dioxide and it temperture average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

Astronomers are intreged that Venus once have been a Earth-like place before.

Years ago, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" As it sates in Paragrapgh 4,sentence 3. Venus might be like mars because Venus might be worthy of living but we won't know for sure if scienists don't study the planet.

Another reason why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it persents because it includes familiar feature like earth. If Venus once had familiar features,then it was probably suitable for forms of life. In the article, paragragh 4,sentence 4 states ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Eath"" Also in paragapgh 4 sentence 5 states ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and included familiar feaatures such as valleys, mountains and craters.""

Also in paragraph 3,sentence 2 sates ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid Venus's atmosphere.""

Another reason why it be might be dangerous, if the scientists decide to study the planet is because of the temperture of being 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Even though if a human being can't step a foot on Venus, it can send a special meachine that can withstand that temperture.

I dont think that he explained good enough on why its worth it.

The author of the artical, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" tells us that ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too.""

The author has given us an idea that has said ""that studying venus is a worthly pursuit despite the danger it presents"" the author well supported this idea by gives us infromation of the danger and study of venus .

The authors idea had talked about danger in venus. In the article it says ""Venus has the hottest suface tempertature off any planet in out solar system, even though Mercury is the closer to our sun""( paragraph 3 ). This means that venus is stranger beacuse it is the hottest it not even the closest to our sun. In the article it also says

""Planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further vists to its suface?""( paragraph 4 ).

The article also says "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus. Even mosre challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere.""( paragraph 3 ).

C9D48C4F4943,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a paper that sets out to support that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. After analyzing the paper, I am prepared to make the claim that the author fails to do so. He/she presents a vast array of information on the dangers of exploring Venus, as well as the challenges of doing so, but forgets almost entirely to argue that studying Venus is still is worthy pursuit. The majority of the essay focuses on setbacks, not rewards.

The author begins by explaining how spacecraft cannot survive on Venus long, and that previous missions have been short for that very reason. The pessimistic tone is continued in Paragraph 3, where the author describes the formidable heat, pressure, geology, and weather of Venus, and how such intense conditions would complicate research efforts. It states, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of hihgly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" In paragraphs 5 and 7, possible ways to combat these road blocks are discussed. Left out of the conversation is the ""why?"" The author describes NASA's efforts to bipass Venus's problems (like designing a hovering device or considering the use of mechanical computers) but doesn't fill readers in on why such pursuits would even be worth the effort. The question, ""We can, but why should we?"" is not answered.

To say that the author was not successful in vouching for rearch of the planet Venus is not to say that attempts were not made. Paragraphs 4 and 8 make a few attempts at telling readers why researching is still a good idea. The author informs readers that Venus is of-interest to scientists because it is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Mentioned also is that Venus is sometimes the closest option for planetary visitation, making its exploration a more economical choice than other planets. Paragraph 8, the conclusion, says, ""Striving to meet he challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Here the author is saying that Venus should be studied because we can gather information, and humans are curious. This is not science or fact-based, and is not strong because it is common knowledge, not argumentative material. If addressing why researching Venus is a worthy pursuit is supposedly one of the focal points of the 8-paragraph paper, evidence supporting it should be found in more than two places.

In conclusion, ""The Challlenge of Supporting Venus"" did not do a good job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. In fact 6 out of the 8 paragraphs talk mostly about what a struggle exploration would be, and the work it would require. It focused more on giving the reader facts and figures about why studying Venus would be difficult, nearly impossible, even, but it did not thoroughly explain why such difficulties should be worked through, or why researching Venus is a fruitful and worthwhile endeavor.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
2AC4EE3FFE08,"""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", this is a challenge because of Venus's reputation. Venus is the closet planet to earth due to density and size, it orbits the sun at a different speed. Because Venus is Earth's neighbor, somebody wanted to explore it. Trying to explore Venus has failed for over three decades. In paragraph 2 it writes, ""and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" The author came to the conclusion that Venus had a reputation that's challenging for humans to study. The author writes, "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 persent of carbon dioxide blankets Venus. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Humans can not survive in carbon dioxide, Venuns's air isn't breathable, the pressure that it has keeps and spacecraft from leaving after it comes in. Paragraph 2 explains ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our occens and would liquefy many matals."" Venus is so hot that it will melt the finest metal into liquid.

The author wants to know why would any one still want to go to Venus if it's too dangerous to vist anyway. The author explains that long ago Venus had been a fit planet for humans to live in. He says, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Just because Venus is hot doesn't mean that it didn't have some form of life before it got that way, something had to of happened. The author explains that Venus could be ""our nearest option for a planetary visit, acrucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" This infoprmation explains that they have a way to explore without any physical issues. NASA came up with the idea that someone would go in and hover in the air to aviod the damages. The temperature of where they will be wouldn't be as hot as the ground but it would less than 800 degrees Fahrenheit. NASA explains that it's a risk to get on the ground to ""get up and personal"" but they can't take any objects from the planet. NASA is working on another approach to study Venus, in the mean time they're currently using ""mechanical computers"" to physcially pick up things with strength but that's also a risk but it can melt during the process. The author gives many reasons as to why exploring venus is a challenge to explore because it's climate is so hot that anything and anybody will melt. Spacecrafts and other materials are not able to survive during the process of exploring venus. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

During all this time all the best and expert sciencetist are working together to test a method nd see if we can live on that planet without dying or not producing food or water or even shelter. While testing we figured out that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. So that is why I think during the proccess on living venus or in the future testing methods if we could live pn venus or see if we can grow crops or bring like equiment to test samples on we can evole on this planet near us. Even the thought of going to a new planet is a big turn of events because we dont know how its atmosphere works or gravity or air/oxygen or weather climate change or anything but we are learning about it really fast where we have to make a high expert group of people to risk their lives to see if we can produce our species or our tech,food,citys, or even animal life in conculsion to make sure that we sure we dont make the smallest mistake to screw up the plans for us to live or visit venus in future but in mean time we have people training to become the best of the best for this secret peoject if it happens.

The other thing is they found out about venus is that "" a thick atomsphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus"" according to the article .

And venus it the hottest plant even though mercury closer to the sun so it means that venus wont really be safe for us .

The author says Venus is ""Earth's twin,"" and further supports this with ""it may have well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" ""It,"" reffering to Venus. The author states Venus has ""valleys, mountains, and craters."" Telling the readers this information makes it seem as if seeing Venus would feel comfortable to us and nothing too out of the ordinary.

As ordinary as the author tries to make a trip to Venus seem he doesn't end up leading us in the wrong direction, as he also states the dangers, ""humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world. Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" Reading that information makes it seem doubtful humans could ever explore Earth's neighbor.

The author goes on to suggest ideas that NASA has pulling the reader back in to believe that it could be promising to think that one day humans can explore Venus. ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" That's a lot to take in but the author makes it easy for us to understand the idea by comparing it to ""Jet airplanes traveling higher to fly over many storms.""

The author wraps it up by saying ""Venus has value."" He doesn't go deep into the what ""value's"" exploring Venus could have. Only thing he stats is ""insight,"" and ""human curiosity.""

9A1E52D736D7,"Exploring the unknown ""great frontier"" of space has always captivated the minds of many people. Recently, there has been a lot of talk at orginazations like NASA and SpaceX about sending a man to Mars. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author writes about how studying Venus is a worty endeavor despite the dangers. The author supports this idea very well by describing the dangers of Venus and explaining the lengths groups like NASA have to go to in order to make it past these challenges.

First, the author supports the idea of Venus being a worthy pursuit by describing, in great detail, the challenges of exploring Venus. In the article, the author talks about the many dangers on and around Venus. For example, the article states ""...temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" By using these details about the dangers of Venus, the author is able to support his idea, because the reader is able to understand how dangerous it is to explore Venus

Next, the author further supports his claim by explaining why groups like NASA want to explore Venus. In the article, the author claims the reasons scientists want to explore Venus are ""...[Venus] may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" The author also says ""...[Venus] could have supported various forms of life"" and ""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable..."" These excerpts from the article help the author support his claim very well by comparing the reasons for exploring Venus with the dangers of doing so.

In conclusion, the author does a very good job of supporting his claim by describing the dangers in great detail and then comparing these dangers to the reasons people still want to explore the planet. In doing so, the author is able to effectively communicate with the reader about why NASA continutes to try to explore Venus. In the future, this article could inspire future scientists to come up with a new way to explore the surface of Venus.  ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

AE8972172BF0,"Exploring Venus will be dangerous but humans can get knowledge about Venus and see more than any telescope can show us.

Venus is the second closest planet in space and the hottest planet in our solar system.

But if we can explore it then we will understand how it works and if there is life on Venus.

Even the slightest life form will be amazing and then we can do experiments on it and see how it can substain life on the hottest planet.

Danger will come when we explore Venus but it will be worth it if we can survive on it and we will find a way to explore it without the ship melting or exploding.

A good reason that we need to explore Venus and find a way to substain life on it, is that it is the planet that is the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.

This planet could have had oceans and life form many years ago because there was craters, valleys, and mountains at one time or another.

The text states, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valley, mountains, and craters"".

Venus is sometimes the nearest option to planetary visit.

If we make it to Venus then we will be able to explore more planets and understand more about our planet.

When we make it to Venus we will have to hover 30 or plus miles above the surface so the astronants will not have to deal with the dangerous conditons and temperatures that come with the planet.

The text states, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit"".

If we could survive on this planet then we would have plenty of solar power and that's how we would get our energy to power our ships, houses, and ect.

The text states, ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels.

NASA is finding a way to visit Venus by using silicon carbide and this concoction has lasted up too three weeks in a simulation.

The text says, ""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted up too three weeeks in such conditions"".

They are also looking at mechanical computers that is old technology that was tested before.

They are looking at older computers because the newer computers are delicate and can not take a hit or it will break.

For example try to take someones celephone and put it in an acid or heat that is capable to melt tin that is what the modern computers will do if they take them to Venus.

Venus is one of the hottest planets but is the most interesting planet.

It is like the Earth in many ways.

Venus has many challenges and it is in human nature to complete challenges and take them head on.

Venus has many beautiful items but also has many destructive storms and volcanoes.

NASA´s plan to send humans to Venus safely could very well work but also the way they would be thirty miles above the planett floating will not reallu give them a good look at what they are trying to study. ¨ More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock,gas,or anything else, from a distance.¨, which was stated in the article. The planet Venus has such harsh conditons that humans could not withhold and survive, an example would be that ¨The temperatures average out at over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.¨ which was stated in the article. In my own opinion it would not be smart to even begin to plan a trip to Venus,especially when scientists and NASA know the risks and dangers, it would as if you are setting up their own death if even a spacecraft cannot survive the landing for more than a few hours.

3193A59E5543,"Venus is an intesresting planet that has been studied very little. Venus may be close to the Earth, but it is hard to discover more of the planet, because it has conditions that are different than on Earth. However, this doesn't mean that we should stop discovery. There may be challenges along the way, but scientists will have to find ways to overcome those challenges. It is safe for spaceships to travel, the advanced tecnology, and human curiosity.

Many people may think that since Venus has 97 percent carbon dioxide and tht its over 800 degrees that it's not safe for people to travel because those are extreme measures the human body can not take. However, NASA has a study that scientists will be able to use a vehicle that can hover above Venus. This keeps people safe and helps us discover more of Venus. Also the temperature from 30 miles a way would only be 170 degrees. Its still hot, but it would not be too hot for the human body to withstand. The air pressure would also be close to sea level. Overall, the conditions would not be comfortable, but the human body would be able to take it.

The advanced technology we have today also makes conditions safer to travel. The knowledge we have gained from technology is incredible. Tecnology makes it possible to make spaceships possible to travel to Venus. However, the conditions may be too much depending on who goes on the spaceship. Also when we look back on the old technology to see what worked and what didn't work. Using mechanical parts can help with the spaceship to withstand the heat. There are also many researchers that are working on making machines that can last long enough to find information about Venus.

Sooner or later human curiosity is going to get scientists to go to Venus, but they have to go up with safe equipment. Most of scientists discovery is because of human curiosity. That is why it's worth going up to Venus to get the answers human curiosity needs. The dangers and obstacles shouldn't stop scientists or people from discovering new things. Finding ways to overcome and expand our knowledge on what's out there is what we need to do. Using imaginiation and innovation to be able to discover new things is what is really imporatant.

Venus is a place that needs more discovery. There may be some dangers to discovery and challenges in the process, but that's made to be overcome. With all the progress scientists have made in discovery there is no reason to stop now or ever when discovering something new. What will help scientists get up there is the improved spaceships, the advancements made in tecnology, and the curioisty we have as humans.    ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

In paragraph 4, Venus could have once had oceans. It could have supported various forms of life just like Earth. Venus today still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. It has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. If scientists were able to study Venus, it would help us undertsnad the planet more.

It is hard to study Venus because the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Also even more challenging are the clouds. They consist of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. On Venus's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Venus's atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.

In paragraph 5, it states that NASA has one particulary compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. They want scientists to be able to float above the fray.

In passage four, the author mentions that Venus has mountains, valleys, and craters that resemble those we have on Earth. The author makes a good point in mentioning that Earth and Venus are very different but also very similar.

The author also reveals to us that Venus has an atmosphere made up of about 97% carbon dioxide. This piece of evidence is backed up with passage five, where the author also states that NASA is thinking about usinng the solution of allowing scientists to float above the harsh conditions of Venus' surface. This would allow our scientists to be able to explore and gather more information about Venus all while avoiding dangerous conditions.

in paragraph 8 he states "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the instigtht to be gained by itself, but also becuase human curiosty will likely lead us into many equally itimidating endeavores"". he pretty much says that because of human curiosty it will happen with or without venus having dangers and he believes that we should do somthing before someone else does in the future. he believes even if there is high tempatures, radiation storms, and how 92% of the air is carbin dixoide which is all stated as dangers along with many other dangers of venus on paragraph 3. that we need to do more test and make more things to withstand veuns.

FDE7B432FB27,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author writes about a great number problems that come along with trying to get information on the our planetary neighbor, Venus. We, the readers, learn in detail about the specific challenges that come along with studying Venus, even with its close proximity to us. Despite the author describing all of the struggles that come along with studying our sister planet, the passage still supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthwile pursuit, through giving us strong examples of useful information we could learn, and describing safer and easier ways that we could study it that would make it far more simple to get the desired data.

While there are certainly many difficulties that the passage describes about getting information from Venus, the author thoroughly explains all of the great scientific benefits that we could get out of a Venus mission. As the author describes in paragraph four, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Not only will information about Venus teach us more about the universe around us, it might just be useful in order to study our own planet. Being able to learn so much from what a previous Earth could have been like would be a massive benefit to fields like history, and the earth sciences. The author goes into even more detail about this just afterward, describing how ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Not only are they similar from a geological perspective, it could provide vital information to the studies of biology, and possibly even support details about where we came from to begin with. There are hundreds, if not thousands of scientists specifically studying the cosmos trying to find planets with water that even have a small chance of supporting any form of life. The potential for further discovery here only a short distance away is extrodinary, and the author wisely emphasizes this through the passage.

Not only is the possibility for fascinating exploration and gaining crucial information about the Earth from Venus supported, the author also makes the important point that we are coming closer and closer by the day to this becoming a reality. In the seventh paragraph the author discusses this idea. ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" When they put some of the brightest engineers in the world to a specific task of making electronics that could survive in Venus, the results were successful, as they made them able to survive for almost a month. While a month doesn't sound like a long time for the equipment to last, the author mentions later on in the passage that ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme phyisical conditions."" The most delicate part any device that would land on Venus would be the electronics inside any rover or measuring equipment. The great advances in the durability of these electronics points toward an optimistic future in devices designed for Venus, as we are already seeing incredible progess being made. However, what would happen if they couldn't find a way around the delicacy of modern computers? The author proves that wouldn't be the end of our Venus hopes, that mechanical computers can be utilized in order to avoid easily broken hardware. Even in the worst case scenerio, our scientists are still devising ways to land a probe on Venus.

Though the author presents some great challenges in getting samples and other data from Venus, he strongly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit through the development of new and better ways to survive the harsh atmosphere, and information that could be gained from it that is useful to studying scientific and historical fields back here on Earth that he mentions in the passage.

In paragraph 7 says that NASA will be using ""simplified electronics made of silicon and carbid"" they claim that has been tested in chamber that acts like Venus choas.

All of this reaseach can lead us to new experinces and new discoveries, however; this is really high risk that NASA is taking. Venus can do stuff unexpected and maybe lead this into major disaster. NASA also states that they have other people using old technology to go to Venus and explore. WWII is he type of technology that they are using to explore on to the bright planet. The thing that those other computers have or technology is that they are bigger and stronger ""systems that use mechanical parts can be made resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.""

93E10E079796,"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by saying ,""Venus is Earth's twin and closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size"". In the article it says that Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. Venus is the second planet closest to the sun and because of that the tempetures in Venus are way different than Earth's tempetures.

But some people or scientist actually belived theres life in venus just like earth but alot different because in the article it says,"" Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported varios forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth for example theres surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Even people think that Venus is probably our nearest option for a planetary visit just like in the article it says,"" The National Aeronautics (NASA) has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus"". NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray. Since Venus is the second closest planet to the sun the tempetures are really hot, compared to Earth's tempetures. Its so hot the tempetures in Venus are like 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on Earth.

But Earth and Venus are two planets that probably had same features along time ago and that we all know theres alot to discovered in our solar system and thats what i think the author was trying to support. And mybe it might happen in the near feuture and discovered more about Venus but for right now only time will tell.   ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
16BC1308032A,"In the article, the author suggests studying Venus is, despite the dangers, a worthy pursuit. The author supports the idea of studying venus more by explaining how beneficial it would be to people for them to know more about another planet.

As said in paragraph eight, the author states that human curiosity will lead to ""imagination and innovation"". The author has already explained in paragraphs five to seven NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is already creating possible solutions for how to be able to learn more about the planet that involves either machines or people. One example is allowing scientists to float above the planet but still be able to study it from afar so they will have a lower chance of being harmed or injured during the travel. Another solution would involve innovation so machines could last longer on the planet's surface so the machines would be able to contibute to more knowledge of the plant.

It is true that Venus is a worthy pursuit. It is difficult, almost impossible, to reach Venus and gain more information than what is already known. Therefore, to be able to develop a machine that can last much longer than a few hours after landing, or to be able to send scientist to Venus safely without incident or injury, it would be a great accomplishment.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
FA130E0C813E,"Yes, I believe that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit also. In paragraph 4, it states ""astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar sytem."" It was once covered with large oceans. Venus has features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. If Earth was to end Venus would possibly be our best choice to go to.

Venus is referred to as Earth's ""twin."" Venus has the density and size closest to Earth. In paragraph 8, is states "" Venus has value."" Only because the insight we have so far on Venus is unbelievable. Studying more on this planet may lead us to many equally intimidating endeavors.

There are also many more things we need to study about Venus, that may not be so safe. Venus is the second planet to our sun, which may be too hot for humans to be on. This planet is a very challenging place to examine. Each mission that was sent to Venus no spacecraft has survived more than a few hours. In paragraph 2, it states ""not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" Not one person have been missioned to go to Venus for those reasons.

In paragraph 3, it states ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."" Also in paragraph 3, is saids ""the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" These issues are way too dangerous for humans to be on. Solar power could be plentiful but the raditation would not exceed Earth levels. This may still be survival for humans.

In paragraph 6, it states ""researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" Like I have said no human has been on Venus because they will die right away. But, they believe they can make a machince that last long enough to live to take those samples. They would have to make that machine with mechanical parts so that it can be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. In paragraph 8, it states "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" I believe they will and can studying farther than they have in the past years. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
1.51E+11,"In this passage, it is made very clear that exploring Venus is very unsafe for humans. While it is stated in paragraph 2, Venus can be thought of as a twin to Earth and it has many similarities, there are also many differances that make it very difficult for humans to set foot on Venus. In paragraph 3, it states ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" The atmosphere of our similar neighboring planet is just too toxic for a human to last long on the surface, let alone be able to call that planet their new home. Also in paragraph 3, it is stated that Venus's average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit which is impossible for earth living creatures to survive in. Also, the atmospheric pressure is so much greater than Earth's that the two conditions combined are too extreme for human life. Scientists may be able to find a way around all these issues, but it will take great amounts of time and effort.

Over time, all the issues involving the conditions of Venus may not matter. NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, has been looking into the issues for years. NASA is attempting to travel to Venus, but not land on the planet to evaluate it. If NASA could get rock samples and test the atmosphere around Venus, they could possibly find ways to edit it or edit human immunities to make it more likely to support human life on Venus. This would take a while to achieve and there is potential that nothing scientists find could improve the liklihood of life on Venus.

Recently, NASA has found kinds of electronics that can survive on Venus, but don't last long. In order to find out more about the probability of eventually having life on that planet, someone needs to develop a form of technology that will last long enough to evaluate the living conditions that future humans would have to undergo. Finding the materials needed to make electronics last on Venus is very difficult. The temperatures are so extreme that most materials would just melt. Eventually, it was discovered that mechanical computers, a very old form of technology, could last on Venus. If all electronics could be composed of the things the mechanical computers are composed of, it is probable that electronics could last for long periods of time on Venus and be able to collect the data needed to investigate the idea of human life on Venus.

Thanks to the data the electronics could gather, eventually things could be altered on Venus, on Earth, or both in order to allow life on the planet. These changes could take generations to be completely effective. The great difference in climate between the two planets, for example, could take many years to become less of an issue.

Although, there are many things keeping people from living on Venus, people must first make enough advances to visit Venus. If people are not able to set foot on the planet for long enough to collect samples to test back on Earth, there would be no way of supporting life long enough for people to live there. If people can get to the point of being able to stand on Venus without issue, then the advances will pretty well be enough to support life on our neighboring planet. The first step, however, is also the largest one. Advancing that much could take a large period of time, but it is definitely possible. Life on Venus could be a lot closer than some may think. In all reality, the differerances may not be that great, especially compared to the differences between Earth and other neighboring planets. There is evidence of water on Venus in years past, so if water can be put back on Venus or if waterbodies can be found on Venus once again, life could be supported in the years approching.

Although there are many dangers of life on Venus, it is nothing that Earth living creatures couldn't handle. Besides the temperature and atmosphere, life could easily be supported. These are big obstacles to pass, but there is no doubt that it could be overcome. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
062EA012507B,"The author made it clear to us why they feel like we should persue Venus. The author had many facts to back up his idea that exploring Venus is worthy but can be dangerous. The author described many aspects of what could happen if we go to Venus. The author is very interested about Venus and gave a thorough explanation of why we should pursue Venus despite the dangers by giving supportive details of how it relates to planet Earth.

The author gives descriptive details on how Venus is just like earth and why we should go there in paragraph 4. The authors says that ¨The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters¨. This part of the text makes it to where Venus is a safe place to go because it ¨includes familiar features¨ as earth does. Which makes the reader believe that their is another planet like earth out their in the Solar system. Venus having ¨valleys, mountains, and craters¨ shows how closely related the planet Venus is to Earth. By the author putting this into the text give us a visual of what Venus really looks like if we touch down and started to build a civilization their.

The author gives the reader a realistic condition of Venus of why it is worth it but dangerous. In paragraph 5 towards the bottom the authors describes the conditions by saying ¨...temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth./ Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans¨. The author gives us a little scare of how it is dangerous because the temperature levels is ¨at around 170 degrees¨. That is very high and seems that no one would be able to survive there. The author also says ¨air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth¨ which is saying that the air level of 170 degrees is as close sea level so we could pontentially survive it. The author ends is by saying ¨Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans¨, which explains why he believes that it is dangerous but since it is survivable it is worth the try.

Furthore more, the author gave great explainitory details of what could come if we live on Venus, that of the good and the bad. Throughout the text the author explains ways that Venus is dangerous but can be liveable towards humans. The authors explains ways of how the human population is trying to get to Venus by telling us about NASA

4DD4B58B56A8,"Our Universe is big, and even that is an understatement. It would take thousands upon thousands of years just to explore our own galaxy. Beyond ours are millions if not billions or trillions of other galaxies waiting to be explored. For now though, our best course of action seems to be to explore our own personal solar system. Although this continues to prove difficult to accomplish. Why? Well look no forward than our neighboring planet and what's considered as ""Earth's Twin"" Venus!

You think with a nickname like that it be relatively simple to land on. That part has been pretty much nailed down but the real dilema is attempting to have the spacecrafts continuing functionallity on the surface. According to the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" it states that: ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus' atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" (Para. 3) With a description like that, It definetly wouldn't be the ideal vacation destination, let alone for a single person to stand on. Even for a spacecraft it's a brutal environment. To put it in perspective, the article states: ""Such an evironment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving in the deepest parts of our oceans and would liqufiy many metals."" (Para.3) I think you can understand why the average life expectancy of a probe is so little.

Why do we continue to explore it though, well scientists predict that at one point Venus could have been a sutiable spot to sustain life. The article states: ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains and craters."" (Para.4) Though the article doesn't state this, Keep in mind that for valley's and mountains to form you'd need some sort of body of moving liquid to erode and shape it's surface. Another big factor is being it's proximity, the article states that: ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that we are sometimes closer to Mars and other times to Venus."" (Para. 2) This proves to be a redeeming quality this strategy since a probe or even manned mission wouldn't cost nearly as much (regarding fuel) and would be rather easy to return home from.

In actuallity though, How do we purpose to send people there. We'll we're most likely going to use a tactic that seems almost larger than life. The article purposes that: ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian land. Just as our jet airplans travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" (Para. 5) This seems absolutley ridiculous but based on research it could prove to be a viable option. Although it's the safest way to attempt a manned mission to Venus, it's not without its flaws. According to the article: ""temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" (Para.5) regarding the climate on the ground though, I think 170 degrees Fahrenheit would be considered a saving grace from God.

Only time will tell what mysteries lie beneath the surface of Venus' foggy and dense atmosphere. As technology and hospitalty advances, we may soon be able to even attempt a manned mission. One can dream but it seems that the future continues to be ever the more promising as we will begin to learn more and more about our troublesome sister planet.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
C405CB0C12D2,"Scientist are interested in exploring Venus but they find it very hard to explore it. Venus has high temperature that make it harder for them to be able to get a closer look at it which makes it a challenge for scientists for to even get a closer look at it. If Venus is Earth's sister planet why is it so inhospitable for us to live in it.

Why are scientist wasting their time trying to explore it and how would we know what is actually in Venus if we haven't yet explored it. I think it may be a bit to dangerous for any of us to actually be able to explore it without the right equipment and the right person to send there without knowing for sureif they would be getting hurt or not. I think it is to much of a risk to send someone up there and risk their lifes all just to be sure if Venus is safe or not.

It is also called the ""Evening Star"" because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. On Venus, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than on Earth.

These conditions are far more extreme than anything human would encounter on Earth.

It is not suprising that the temperature average is so high given the fact that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. So basically, if you walk on Venus you will get burns.

Studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky because it is simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.

Yes, Venus has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely, but although it is not clear due to the fact that 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, it is still simple to see from the distant, safe vantage point.

No spacecraft survived for more than a few hours because of the carbon dioxide blanketing clouds of Venus.

The clouds of Venus most likely explains why not a single spacecraft torched down on Venus for more than three decades. Venus's atmosphere at night is not affected by carbon dioxide of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. This is exactly why studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky is simple for an amateur stargazer to spot.

Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

Venus has value because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself just like intimidating endeavors does as well.

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, it should only be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.

So, because our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts, intimidating endeavors should only be expanded to meet the imagination and innovation of the travel.

So, because Venus is simple to see from the distant and because our travels should be expanded, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it only presents a small amount of dangers.

The author thinks that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit. This is something we really have to think about given how long it takes to travel in space. It is almost to dangerouse to explore Venus on the ground so scientists are trying to build blimp -like vehicles to float above Venus. The blimp would have to be about 30 miles in the air to avoid all the storms. The only problem with this is that researchers can't get samples of rock, or anything else, from a distance.

So even though Venus is very dangerouse to explore NASA is trying to find a way to explore it and get more information on itto see if thigs used to be able to live on it and maybe to see if anything could live on it today. Even though it is very dangerouse I think Venus needs to be explored. I think that if a species could live on Venus that would be great so I think we need to keep trying to find ways to explore it.

I personally think that the author says this with the meaning that, even if we don't get anything besides just the completion of the task, we as a species got the invaluable experince of knowing what to do when faced with a chance for challenge and the potential future exploration of a similiar nature.

The planet venus has a surface temp of 800 degress fahrenheit which would make the planet inhabitable. The temperature of venus would melt metals. The pressure there could crush whole submariens.

The bad reasons why going to Venus to study it is the temperature it is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we have in our own planet. Even if they did go there they would burn to deat because on how hot it is. It could crush and even liquefy the metals of a submarine if they go down deep in some parts of the ocean.

The good reasons for studying Venus is that what has it been doing, has anything happened? Scientist has asked these3 questions and we still don't know the answers to them.

41DAE20A16DF,"This article starts out by telling the audience about all of the pros and cons of Venus. The first thing is mentions is how at some times we are so close to it that many people think it is a star, and it talks about how humans on Earth can easily see it at a safe distance, but it is very difficult to get close to. Venus is the cloest planet to Earth's density and size. The author explains how he thinks that it is a worthy cause to try to explore venus, even though we have never successfuly landed a spacecraft there for more than a few hours.

The author does very well arguing his or her point. I agree with the author, I think he or she made some very well stated points about why humans should work everyday to get closer and closer to Venus. There are many arguing points as to why poeple would think that it is good or bad to try to send spacecrafts, let alone humans, to Venus. Starting out with the dissadvantages, the planet's surface is over 800 degrees, obviously not suitable for humans, or any life force for that matter, to survive. Venus has a hotter surface temperature than any other planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun, due to the atmosphere made up of almsot 97 percent carbon.

These facts sound misserible so far, but if there was a way that humans could figure out how to land on Venus safely, and maybe even start a civilization there, that would be groundbreaking. The author backs up his or her point by saying how ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The fact that at one time Venus might have been covered in water has convienced me that there is some sort of way to create life there.

Venus is made up of mountians, valleys, and craters.

The author does a very good job describing and pin-pointing all of the detailed needed to convience someone to beilve in life on Venus, and support sending probes and eventually humans out to discover Venus. The authors talks about how hard it would be for a mission to Venus to be both safe and productive, but he or she also talks about how much we would gain from it. The author shows how floating in a blimp, 30 miles above the surface would be almost suitable for humans to survive, at 170 degrees.

The information the author provides to support the idea is that there is a way and its a worthy prusuit despite the dangers there are.

Through out the article after paragraph three the author explains all the ways that make it possible to explore and study Venus. He explains in paragraph four that since Venus is much similar to our planet, Earth, that we should look into Venus again and try to gain more information about the planet. It's the nearest option for a planetary visit so why not. The author mentions in paragraph five that NASA has a idea for sending humans to study Venus in a safe way. Their idea was to have a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above to prevent being near the hot surface of Venus. At this height it will be survivable for humans. This sounds very workable.

He lists facts that highlight Venus's inhabitability, such as "" No spacecraft has survived on venus for more than a few hours"", ""The atmosphere is almost 97% carbon dioxide"", and ""the clouds are of highly corrosive sulfuric acid"".

In Paragraph 5, the author presents the idea of a blimp, floating 30 miles above the venusian atmosphere, Could be maintained and be used in the research of Venus. At this altittude, the author lists "" temperatures would only be a toasty 170 degrees Fahrenheit"" and ""Air pressure would be close to sea level on Earth"". However, the author does not cover the resources needed to produce a spacecraft of the scale.

Even if the author builds the fact that it is currently impossible to send a manned mission to Venus, The author does inspire interest in the topic. Through the description of several ideas that could be actualize into their desired goal, The author builds reason for belief of his topic.

The author ends his peice with the conclusion of ""Our Travels on Earth and beyonds should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and inovation"". This ending supports his arguement because it gives the argument that no matter what, knowledge will be gained and expanded from this challenging task.

Planet venus also called by another name ""Evening Star"" Venus is one of the brightest point according to the author it says "" It light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot"". The author use this sentence to show how the Venus planet or Evening star shine. It also tell us that Venus have an atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Planet Venus is also the second planet from our sun, which is very important to.

The distance between Venus and Planet Earth. Venus and planet Earth are close not really really close but they are close according to the article ""Challenge of Exploring Venus""

the author tell us that "" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"". That sentence that the auhtor use describe and also give us information about which planet is the closest planet to planet Earth which is Venus. By the reading the article it's also says that Venus was propable covered largely with oceans. Planet Venus also have somethings in common with planet Earth. Planet Venus has a surface of rocky they also have valley and mountains like planet Earth does.

More about planet Venus. Planet Venus and planet Earth does not have the same temperatures, according to the author information it says that ""Planet Venus have a temperature average over 800 degrees"". If we take our times to think about this sentence think about one hundreds (100) degrees, one hundreds (100)

AAD603BCE946,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The text states many facts and statistics; therefore, the author supports this idea well, for he/she describes why astronomers are amazed by Venus, what NASA is planning on approaching the planet, and explaining the type of challenge it is to explore this dangerous ""Evening Star."" Reading the passage, the author is convincing about the subject that he/she has chosen.

The planet, Venus, is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, as the author suggests. Supporting this idea, the author shows many examples, facts, and ideas why he/she thinks Venus is a worthy planet to keep studying, for the text states, ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" The writer describes that important studies come out of exploring Venus's reputation, even though it is the hottest planet in our solar system. The author supports the claim that Venus has many thrilling factors in Paragraph 3. Paragraph 3, Line 6 states, ""Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like eruping volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to porbes seeking to land on its surface."" The author demonstrates his knowledge telling the readers that Venus cause many disasterous events that happen all around the world.

As the author claims that Venus is worth studying for, Paragraphs 4 through 7 shows evidence about scientists still studying Venus as of today and why geologists and atronomers are so fascinated with the blazing planet. In Paragraph 4, Line 2 states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Scientists state that even today, Venus has features that look like mountains, as read in the passage. Testing his knowledge in the prompt, the author demonstrates that NASA wants to make visiting Venus possible. Throughout Paragraphs 5 through 7, it states what NASA's (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) plan is to successfully observing Venus from a up-close point of view. In Paragraph 5, Line 2 and 3 state, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."" As being stated as a ""possible solution,"" the author shows NASA's solution is not an effecient plan, for Paragraph 6, Lines 1 through 4 state, ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges."" In the authors statement, NASA need samples of rocks, gas, and other types of samples to have a full discovery of Venus. Because of the obstacle in NASA's way, they decide to make other approaches to studying Venus, for they understand that meeting to Venus' standards will take years. Lastly, as the author's final example on why Venus is a worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents is in Paragraph 8, which states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Or travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" The narrator claims that exploring all of our options that have dangers should not limit us as human beings to give up and quit. He/she states that we should move along all of the doubts and dangers and increase our imagination on all levels.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. As the author states many facts on why scientists should continue their research on Venus, he/she supports their claim well. The passage describes why astronomers study Venus as well as what NASA is planning to do to approach the Evening Star. The writer believes that although Venus has many dangers to humans, we should take the challenge exploring Venus offers to us and go beyond our limits to achieve the goal that geologists, astronomers, and scientists want to acquire.

This is not a bad thing, being curious has changed life on Earth durasically. New inventions have been made vaccines have been created to help people improve their quality of life. Not only has the human curiosity helped to improve life here on Earth, but it has also brought new knowledge about the things outside of Earth's atomosphere.

Since the 1800s devices had been made to expaned people's knowledge about the planets around Earth. Computers have been made that ""make calculations by using gears and levers."" These machines had been made as early as the ""1800s and played an important roles"" in human history. ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick."" With the modern advances in technology there are no reasons to why with even more improvements made humans would not be able to go an explore other planets such as Venus.

Changing perspective on going to Venus could help humans to one day actually go and study the magnificent planet of Venus. ""We should think of them (risks) as challenges."" Instead of thinking of the opsticalls that will have to be faced when going to Venus, think of them as challenges that will have to be overcame to get the succes and the results needed.

There are other approaches that could be taken on traveling to Venus. ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus"". Despite the dangers that lie ahead with traveling to Venus there are so much more advantages and knowledge that can be gained from going to Venus. By actually going on Venus NASA sciencetist would be able to study ""rock, gas, or anything else"" that is more than what could be done if they only got a 'birds eye view' of Venus.

Sciencetist could discover exactly why Venus is ""so inhospitable"" compared to Earth. They would be able to comferm their beliefs of Venus being ""covered largely with oceans"". Sciencetist could find out what Venus would have been able to support. They would be able compare how exactly Earth and Venus are so simular and also how they are so different. The knowledge that they learn could even improve life here on Earth.

Humans are always going to want to discover new things outside of Earth's atomosphere, which has helped improve life for many people. With the modern advancements being made in technology and the knoewledge that could be optained by going to Venus there is no reason to why in the near future exploration of Venus should not be mastered.

Now obviously there has to be something on Venus or we wouldn't be going through all this trouble to get there. What is so good about Venus?

Yes, Venus does seem like a scary place if you read about it, but the only reason scientists want to look into it more is because of the similarities it has to our Earth.

As mentioned in paragraph 4 ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.

Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Scientists want to look more into Venus because of what we could do with it.

Venus is a planet close to earth it is a planet where not many people go to see for reasons like its dangerous,, its average over 800 degrees fahrenheit that not many people survive going to see it, its powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes but the NASA still send people to study it.

Venus is dangerous because of its tempeture and hoe risky it is but the NASA has ideas of still sending people up there to study it like for example in passage 5 ""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

The writing also seem very credible. The author backed up their idea by supporting their beliefs well with evidence. The author also provided numerous informations of planet Venus. Not only did they support it with facts, but also with wisdom.

The author started by giving readers information about Venus and how it relates to Earth, our world. The author described Venus as ""Earth's twin."" The author also let the reader know that Venus in the ""closes planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" By doing so, we may feel more connected to Venus since Earth is our home. It chatches our attention because we may feel that we can relate.

After readers get into reading, the author provided more great details about Venus. He described planet Venus conditions and why it is so challenging for scientists to study the ""Evening Star."" According to the author, the ""conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth"" and ""would liquefy many metals."" He also gave a background information on how each ""previous mission was unmanned"" and ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" This illustrates how dangerous Venus is. However, the author turn this negativity into a way to learn mistakes. The author says ""Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus,"" in a way that those factors that may have led to fail previous missions could now be avoided. Mistakes do really teach us lessons.

After the author discussed about the dangers and challenges of Venus, readers may wonder why scientists would even bother to study such a life-less planet.

Venus also has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid with temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit which is 90 times hotter than the earth. beyond that it suffers a lot of natural disasters.

To acheive this scientists have to refrain from bringing things like rocks or gas or anything from a distance, so to change that, NASA is working on how to make electronics with silicon carbide and also using old technologies that dosent require electronics to prevent them melting and causing radiation.

The first reason why it is hard to study Venus is because of it's atmosphere. The text states,""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.""This quote means that it will be very hard to walk on the surface if it is that high of an atmosphere. The text also states,""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This means that a person from NASA could never extand that weather and it would be hard to study it.

The second reason why it is hard to study Venus is how the surface is.

This means that they tried to predict what Venus is like but it's still hard to study. The text also states,""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration givin the long time frames of space travel.""

The third reason why it is hard to study Venus is the technology used for the study. The text states,""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This means that Earth's technology would not work for studying if they used a lot of it.

This not only gives us a size comparison, but also a distance comparison between the two, causing us to want to study the planet too. Also, the author also uses the fact, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,"" which leads us to further our belief on how the planets are so similar.

In addition to being closely related to Earth, the author also believes that studying Venus would give us valuable information on the planet, and what it has to offer. The author throws out examples like, ""samples of rock, gas, or anything else."" Even though the author is saying that getting these samples would be dificult to recieve from a distance, he/she is still using these examples as evidence to make us want to explore the surface of Venus.

Finally, the author believes the plans that are being created to study Venus are reasonable and valid. He/she uses the evidence, ""NASAs possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" The author uses this to give us insight on one of the plans NASA is creating, and why it is worth investigating. In paragraph five, the author uses the comparison, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms."" This text is talking about how the shuttle NASA would use would be able to dodge some of the dangers of of the planet. The author believes that this could work, and thinks that it is a compelling reason to further our investigation on the planet Venus.

For the reasons that Venus close to our planet, it would give us worthy information about it's physical composition, and the plans being created to explore the planet are valid and reasonable, the author believes that exploring the surface of the planet Venus is a worthy pursuit.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

In the passage The Challenge of Exploring Venus, the author suggests that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. He supports this idea by explaining the dangers and background of Venus then by telling the plan of making it work and the reason why.

To begin the story, the author presents background information on Venus including its relation to Earth and the solar system. Then goes on to explain the difficulties that have been present in trying to explore this planet. It states in paragraph 2, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This quote simply speaks for itself but was not used accidently because it lets the reader infer how serious the conditions are on Venus. The fact that a spaceship, made out of materials specifically for exploring space, couldn't survive the landing shows how fatal this planet can be.

After reviewing all of the conditions and background of this planet, the mission to study this planet is still, or even more, prioritized then if these details weren't known. Most humans are very stubborn and once they have the desire to do something, it doesn't go away until that thing happens. This heavily relates to scientists and explorers, because part of their job is to discover things and help things make sense. Another crontributer is curiosity, most explorers are full of it and if they aren't they probably don't enjoy their job much. As it says in paragraph 8, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus) Not only will the success of studying the planet satisfy their curiosity of it, but it will lead to more discoveries and curiosities to make things even more worthwhile.

Throughout the story, the author supports the idea that the dangers of Venus are worth the risk if it means being able to study and discover new things. If humans didn't have curiosity life would be boring, it would be the same thing all the time no one would have the urge to do something new or figure something out.

Scientists are working together and brainstorming ideas to make the study of Venus possible not only to satisfy themselves but to help others in new discoveries. Imagine a life without living, sometimes dangerous things are worth the risk if it leads to a longlasting prize.    ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
701E5C324B37,"There is great value in exploring Venus, despite the overwhelming dangers and obstacles that currently prevent us from doing so. From an incredibly powerful atmospheric pressure capable of crushing submarines to clouds of extremely corrosive sulfuric acid that can melt almost anything, Venus is an inhospitable planet that seems virtually impossible to explore. Despite the challenges that are presented, NASA believes there is value in exploring Venus such as furthering the science of space travel and research and we will recieve great insight into the planet it's self.

We humans have been dreaming of one day being able to explore the seemingly endless abyss of space since astrology was born back in the middle ages. Now that we have the technology to explore beyond our planet, we have been working nonstop to reach beyond what we have once reached. Exploring Venus will be an astounding feat and will prepare us further for other obstacles we will face when we attempt to explore other planets. In paragraph 8, the author mentions, ""but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" This was referring to the value of exploring Venus and the experience we will gain from it.

Along with getting experience for much more demanding tasks that lie ahead, we will also get plentiful information about Venus from exploring it and a better understanding of other planets as well. Stated in paragraph 8, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself,"" the author included this into the text because the more knowledge we have on the planet Venus, the more information we'll have on our own planet and many others. In paragraph 4, it is stated that Venus was once mostlikely like our own planet, possibly covered largely wih oceans and mountains. This is supported in the paragraph with the statement, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth.""

However, exploring Venus is still an extremely dangerous and demanding task. Venus' atmospheric pressure is far greater than our own along with having acid rain and a surface temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, making it completely uninhabitable. This will make exploring Venus that much more difficult.

Despite the challenges we will face, advances in technology are bringing us closer to being able to explore the face of Venus.

What is their solution? Their solution is trying to imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape, they are wanting to prove that if their jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude that can fly over many storms then a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.

They want to find the safest way possible so they can send people up to Venus since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. They have to find the right vehicle to get sent up to Venus because there is high pressure and heat that is like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes. Most people would just want to stay out of this and move on but astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.

They are desperate to find a way to get this right and to actually be known for this. Going to Venus is not a easy task and researches have to take a lot of time into this. Most people are probably thinking why is it taking so long, well each previous mission was unmanned and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing like I said early, then this is an issue that leads up to why a spacecraft has not touched down on Venus.

EBD6AB8BAE91,"The author supports his arguement quite effectively, though not without any flaws. The author effectively lists off the benefits of exploring Venus, and proper proposals for doing so, however the complexity and unrealistic assumptions of the solutions as well as the negative descripton of Venus take away from its point rather than benefiting it.

The effective conveying of benefits helps to support its idea of risking danger for the reward of landing. The author describes how Venus is relatable with earth which creates a connection between the reader and Venus, as well as creating a mood of hospitality and familiarity. It also states that because Venus is the ""nearest option for a planetary visit"", it is a benefit to inhabit Venus first. This persuasion effectivly uses logos to show the audience logical reasoning for why the scientists should endevour to research Venus.

The author's proposals for ways to accomplish these tasks help to build ethos in the writing, as it shows that the author knows about the information that is displayed. The introduction of NASA also builds up this ethos, as to bring the audience to better trust in the author. The examples of proposals also provide evidence for how such ideas could be accomplished, such as the ideas of ""systems that use mechanical parts"" and therefore add to the logos of the paragraph, as the author logically explains why the proposals would be beneficial.

However in contrast with the effective support of the main idea, the author also convey's information and techniques that oppose his idea. Firstly, the author makes assumptions about how much technology would have advanced, and because his proposal for a ""blimp-like vehicle"" is so technologically advanced and seems outlansish, the mood created for the audience is incredulous and skeptical. This does not benefit the writer's ideas because of the audiences mood, and therefore the author loses the audiences trust in proper solutions.

Also negatively impacting the main idea are his descriptions of Venus. This is because the author uses a lot of evidence to support how dangerous Venus is, in direct contrast to what he should be supporting. Because of the logos used to show how dangerous Venus is, like how it has ""temperatures average over 800 degrees"" the audience is put into a mood of impossibility and doubt. Because of the mood of the audience, the audience is also less likely to understand why Venus could be beneficial if the landscape is so terribly trecherous.

In conclusion, the writer does a fairly effective job at expressing is ideas, in his building of ethos and pathos that help to support why Venus is so amazing, and how to explore it, however fails by accidently creating a mood of unbelievablity, and therefore losing the audience to the uncertain nature of the situation.

1007965EDA24,"A good argument starts with research. The author of the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" has done his research. Does this mean that his argument is perfect? No. With all this said, I have come to the conclusion that the author has the sufficient evidence to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit, despite the dangers.

First, I would like to address his argumentative claim: studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author is simply saying we should explore Venus. The author is not implying every human being should live on Venus right now. Exploring Venus could be dangerous, but the good outweighs the bad when taking into consideration the advances we could make.

The article says, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus."" The author uses this throughout the article to illustrate that NASA wants to explore Venus. NASA/scientists would not discuss even visiting the surface if it was not a possibility. The author wants to show the audience that it is a worthy and possible pursuit. The author knows the dangers and even expresses them throughout the article. He/she is not trying to hide the fact that their are dangers involved in exploring Venus. The main argumentative point made by the author is the fact that Venus is the closest planet to being exactly like Earth. The article says, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Venus is the closest we can get to the planet we are living on now. The author describes the advances we could get from astronaunts touching down on Venus and exploring. Venus could have been just like Earth, but one will never know until humankind touches its surface. The conditions are not easy, but we will not be able to find out if humans can live there until we study Venus.

In conclusion, one can see the author's suggestion as absurd or one could see possiblility/advancements for humans. I see possibilities in studying/exploring Venus. The author should not have included as much research against his claim that he did and I can understand the opposing sides claim, but I also believe the author illustrated the room for advances. Although I know the dangers presented in this article, the author was still able to convince me otherwise. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
627AF801730D,"In this story the author talks about the many diffcultes we would have on studying Venus. The Author also has some good points on what we could do to study venus even though it may be hard to accomplish for the reasearchers.

Now venus has a thick atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon and has clouds that are highly corrosive of sulfuric acid. And on the surfuce of venus the temperature averages above 800 degrees. The environment could crush a submarine and liquefy many metals.

Venus would be worth studing because it's the most like earth. Now with studying venus we would need a ship that could hover over the plant but it wouldn't give us much insight. Reasearchers cannot take the samples that they need. Reasearchers are working to make innovations to are machines so they can last longer on venus and gain the knowledge of Venus. The need to make are Mechanical parts more resistant to pressure,heat and other forces.

So it would be great if we could study Venus it would be worth it even with the dangers.

The author goes on in paragraphs 5-7, by discussing various ways that scientists are trying, or have tried studying Venus from space. In the first couple paragraphs they explain the different dangers that come with space missions to explore Venus.

The author of this text refers to Venus in paragraph two as ""Earth's 'twin'"".

He begins to elaberate more by given facts about how the two planets are alike. ""Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size"", the author says. Venus is sometimes the closet planet to Earth, thus being the reason why humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on, as the author calls it, a ""cloud-draped world"". Every mission to Venus, hasn't in the lamest terms, been successful. The spacecrafts sent there have only lasted for a couple of hours, and this is why every mission has been unmanned.

There are numerous factors that contribute to humans having many chanlleges to to study a planets with a reputation like Venus. As the author explains, ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 carbon dioxide blankets Venus"". In paragraph three of the text the author goes more in depth about the harshness of Venus's atmosphere. Temperatures on Venus average about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure exceeds those 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth. These types of conditions could crush a submerine made to travel to the deepest parts of our oceans. Depite just the atmospheric conditions Venus has an array of erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes, to name a few, that occur on its surface.

Paragraph four is where the author begins to make more comparisons between Earth and its dangerous sister planet Venus. The author explains or hypothsizes that Venus was once like Earth. They belive Venus at one time had oceans, and could support many forms life, like Earth. Venus has many analogous features similar our planet. Venus has valleys, moutains, and craters. The author also says that returning to Venus is almost indisputable, and how could they make it safer and efficent for scientists.

In the next couple paragraphs the authors goes over the possible NASA and it's scientists are trying to make travel to Venus better. They believe that if man would go on a mission to Venus they would have to travel almost 30 miles above the firery planet. At that distance tempertures would still be above 150 degrss Fahrenheit, but the pressure would have gone down the that of sea levels on Earth. Later in paragraphs 6-8 the author trys to give details on the different ways these scientists are trying to devlop metals and other materials that could last longer than just a couple of hours.

It is very dangerous to study Venus but at the same it's very important for us. According the the article on first paragraph, it said that ""While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it ha proved a very challenging place to examine closely"". This quote show that it may seem pritty easy but for those people who really know about the study of astronomy it is vary challenging. It may be a life threatning for those who study Venus but they take the challenge found all about it, so that people who live on Earth know what is going on with our planet.

The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the danger. In paragraph 2, it said that ""Each previous mission ws unmanned, and for good reason, since no respacecrafe survived the landing for more than a few hours, Maybe this issue explains why not single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous facfors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despte its proximily to us"". This whole quote shows us how dangerous it is that no spacecrafe survive the landing for more thana few hours. However they still give their life to face the challenge for human to study. If no one on earth were to study about our planet then alot of people on earth has to face the disaster.

In paragraph 3 it tells us about the percentage of carbon dioxide blankets Venus, and the challenging of a Venus atmosphere.

In the article, it said that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures averge over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experiece on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth"". This show that they are facing more greater challengies. I think that not alot of people on earth are brave enough to challenge themself where it could cause their life. Therefore alot of poeple need to understand the concept of how it's like to challenge of the thing we are afride of.

The author also stated in paragraph 6 about the risk and important of studying Venus. It said that ""More importantly, researchers cannot take simples of rock, gas, or anyting else, from a distance, Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. This quote show us that the researchers has to go up close to study Venus, in order to find the information all facts about the Venus. It also said that ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow ourmachines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus"".

Therefore studying Venus is important but at the same time it's very dangerous. Alot of people has to face the challenge to finds alot of facts about the Venus. I also think that it's very impoetant to study abot Venus because if we don't know alot about our planet then there will be alot of disster in our earth. It also said it in the last paragraph 8 "" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"".

They don't really explain why we should risk ourselves to study Venus but rather how we could do it. The author talks about how NASA have an idea to hover people above Venus and sending machines down to the surface of Venus.

The first thing that the author talks about is NASA's idea to hover people over Venus to get a closer look at it. In paragraph five it says, ""scientists to float above the fray"". It also states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"". This dosen't give us a reason that Venus is worth exploring even though it's risky. It only tells us about ow we are able to get a closer look at the planet with our own eyes an not just some pictures or videos. Informing the reader about how to do something won't make them believe that it is worth doing.

The second thing that the author talks about is getting machines on the surface of Venus. In paragraph seven it states, ""mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"". It also says, ""looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers"". These quotes demonstrate that the author is more focused on informing us on how we can do this rather than why we should do this. If people don't know why they should do something, then they wont care how they should do it. The author should have put more evidence on how we could use what we learn on Venus in stead of how we could get there safely.

In conclusion, the author didn't do the best job on explaining why it's worth to go to Venus because they focused on how we were supposed to get there. If they didnt just talk about how we were planning to get people and achines there, then it would have been alot better for explaining why it's worth it to study Venus despite of the many dangers.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

9263362F551D,"The last ship to try to land on Venus was three decades ago. Astronots and scientists have been tryong to beat the challenges of Venus. NASA has been working on technology that could survivle the harsh conditions of Venus. They have been testing silicon carbide electronices. NASA been trying to make a blimp-like vehicle that could protecet the astronots that are in it. Scientists have also been working on mechanical computers.

The blimp-like vehicle can be used as a research area as well as a living area for the astronots. It can go higher in the air meaning it can avoid the storm, earthquakes, and erupting volcanoes. NASA has not found a way to use the vehicle to help reasearchers get samples from Venus. Scine they are in the air above the gas clouds it would be hard for researchers to get photography or videography of Venus surface. They have been fooling around with silicon carbide electronics.

NASA and its scientists has been useing silicon carbide electronic in a testing chamber that is set like Venus. This new technology could be used on Venus when NASA figurs out a way to increase the survability time of silicon carbide electronic. They have not figuer it out yet and could be decades before they figer it out. They also have one more item they have been test that is mechanical computers.

We used mechanical computer in 1940s dring World War II. Scientest think that we can make the parts immune to Venus's harsh conditions. They could be made to resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces. This is one of the of projects that will hopefuly beat Venus's challenges.

3C01D1FB2BBF,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author provides a compelling and efficient argument to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Using statistics, factual information, and specific plans being developed as we speak, the author convinces the audience that exploring Venus is worth the risks involved. The author throroughly describes the immersive learning possibilities that could be discovered by studying the foreign planet, the surviveable and safe travel conditions for humans, and other exploration options to ensure a safe and efficient venture to Venus.

First of all, the author immediately combats the argument of Venus being too dangerous to venture. When discussing the exploration of Venus, most people are turned off by its reputation as a dangerous and challenging planet for humans to study. While the author doesn't stray away from these harsh extremities, they make sure to prove how these details seem insignificant and how safe travel can still be executed. The author thoroughly describes the plan provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to allow astronauts to float above the fray and avoid the hazardous conditions. They provide specific qualities of the plan, such as the air pressure being close to the sea level on Earth, the abundance of solar power, and the containment of radiation, to prove how humans would be kept in a safe atmosphere. They even provide a real world connection between NASA's possible solution and a blimp-like vheicle hovering around the ground to make it easier for the audience to understand. The author combats the speculaiton of Venus being too dangerous to explore in order to further support the idea of it being a worthy pursuit.

Furthermore, the author heavily emphasizes the learning opportunities that exploring the foreign planet would undoubtedly provide us. While providing simple, yet interesting facts about Venus, such as it being the planet closest to Earth's density and size, may be enough to intrigue the audience into wanting to learn more about the planet, the author takes it a step further. The author goes in depth about the possibility of Venus being the most Earth-like planet in our solar system long ago. They detail the planet's environment today, consisting of Earth-like structures such as rocky sediment surfaces, valleys, mountans, craters, and other geological findings. They also state ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This information opens up an entirely new realm of possibilites for the audience to consider, and is more likely to interest them as it directly relates to our life on Earth. The way the author has set up the comparisons of Earth and Venus have allowed the audience to view the exploration of the planet as an opportunity to see a planet that could be like us; a planet with living, breathing forms of life similar to what we see everyday. The author uses this information to encourage the audience to view the pursuit of Venus as a chance to gain information on the things we see in our everyday life, and not just complex ideas that are difficult to understand and most-likely won't affect them.

Finally, the author provides numerous options being developed for humans to embark in safe and efficient travel to Venus. When discussing the potential plans to explore the planet, the author states ""Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This quote makes it clear to the audience that scientists are doing whatever it takes to develop multiple, efficient plans for space travel. The author also goes onto provide different examples to further convey how close scientists are to developing the safest plan possible. They specifically mention the use of simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and explain how they've already been tested in a chamber that simulate the conditions of Venus's surfaces, yet how they're still being improved upon. They also describe an old technology called mechanical computer, noting how this technology has already been used frequently in the 1940's and how it can be incorporated into space travel now. The author has given detailed descriptions of the efforts made and the options available to provide a safe embarkment for humans to support the ideas that Venus is a worthy pursit.

Clearly, the author has efficiently and convincingly supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. By describing all the information about the existence of other life forms and the similarities to Earth that we could potentially learn from the study, the author proves how worthy Venus is to be discovered. The author also rebuttals one of the main concerns for traveling to the planet by explaining how plans are being developed to make travel and living conditions surviveable, safe, and efficient for both humans and machines. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author was able to convey and support the idea that Venus is worthy of exploration.",6,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,1.0
95D1717166FC,"Venus is Earth's sister planet. But along with being our sister planet, Venus has the highest recorded temperature of any planet in our solar system. Along with having the highest temperature recorded, Venus also has an atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than the atmospheric pressure on Earth. Clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid also coat Venus's atmosphere, making it difficult to even make it through the outer layers of Venus's atmosphere. So why would Earth's scientists still want to vist Venus?

According to the article, Venus is the planet that is most similar to Earth, well at least it used to be. The author tells the reader about how Venus was probably covered in oceans that could have supported life, similar to Earth. The planet also has many other land forms that are similar to the ones we have here on Earth, such as, valleys, rocks, and craters. The author proceeds to say that ""the value of returning to Venus is indisputable."" Although there are many dangers of sending vessels back to Venus, the author states that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, otherwise known as NASA, is working on ways to send astronauts to Venus. The author also tells the reader that solar power on Venus would be abundant, and that radiation levels would be similar to those on Earth. He goes on to say that the temperature would be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, not an ideal temperature for astronauts traveling to Venus, but it is survivable.

While traveling to Venus may take Earths scientists years to figure out, and be very costly, the information we could learn would be invaluable.

The author stating the reasons why NASA (as well as other astronomers) wants to go to Venus is exactly the answer to the question. The planet could have Earth-like minerals or even evidence of past life that may have lived there long ago. Going to Venus would be risky, but given the opportunity we should explore all the planets we can, just to see what it's like.

The author clearly and concisely explains how very challenging and furthur more dangerous it is to explore Venus. However the author shows how much he believes that it is a worthwhile scientific endeavor.

Within ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author at one point takes great focus on how similar Earth is to Venus. ""Venus is the closest plant to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" The reason as to why the author included this information, is to clarify how scientific research accumulated from Venus can be valueable to our earthly knowledge. For example from a geological standpoint, studying the rocks of Venus could give insight on how long Earth will be habitable, and what awaits at the end. The author gives us an example on a possible way on researching Venus within its' confines. ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the Venusian landscape."" The fact the author goes as far as to reference ideas on how researchers can explore Venus, very well illustrates the author's fondness of the idea. However, there is some evidence to support that the author is not completely on board with some things regarding the exploration of Venus. ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere...""

Dispite the dangers of Venus it is one of our twins, almost the same density and is one of our nieghbors in the atmosphere. The reason we study it is because it is one of the few planets that looks, acts and is close to the sun as Earth. NASA is also thinking of sending sciencetist to Venus to get a more up-close and personal view and too study how Venus reacts.

5AE868041EA1,"Humans have taken extreme measures to achieve their goal of landing on the moon. At the time, many people did not believe that it was ever going to be possible. Today, many astronaut have successfully landed on the moon. The challenge of exploring Venus is another one of these cases that some humans believe is possible, but others do not. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" explains how scientists today strive to meet this challenge and take it on, even after knowing the chaotic conditions of Venus, in order gain insight on the planet as well as to stifle their own curiosity.

The ""Evening Star"", or the planet Venus has extremely dangerous surface and atmospheric conditions for humans to explore, but in many ways has similar features to Earth as well. One of the main reasons humans would not be able to survive a trip to Venus's surface without the proper equipment is because the average surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Because of this, Venus has the hottest surface temperature out of all of the other planets. Another aspect of the dangerous conditions of Venus's surface is that it has frequently-errupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and lightning strikes. Thes conditions would be dangerous for humans if they were on the surface for to long. These are some of the reasons why past attempts of exploration were unsuccessful.

Even though Venus has many dangerous conditions on the surface, there are also many landforms that make it comparable to Earth. Some of these are a scatter of valleys, mountains, and craters. Scientists also believe that Venus used to be covered with vast oceans and potentially could have supported various forms of life.

Even though there are so many components, surface conditions are not the only chaotic feature of the ""Evening Star"". The atmosphere of Venus is also extremely dangerous for humans to surpass. The clouds are filled with corrosive sulfuric acid and the atmosphere is dense with 97% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what is experienced on Earth. These extreme conditions make it far too dangerous for human to explore. To resolve this issue, scientists at NASA today have begun to innovate ideas to find a way to successfully send humans to observe the features of Venus.

One of the approaches NASA is taking to the problem is to simulate Venus's surface conditions in order to test different engineered materials to see how well they withstand the constant heat and pressure. Another approach that the scientists have researched is flying a ""blimp-like vehicle"" about 30 miles about the surface of Venus to avoid having to land on the scorching surface. This method had many plusses because the ""solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels"".

Just like there are many plusses that come this idea, there are also a few negatives. Because flying higher than 30 miles above the surface is one of the only options in getting close enought to observe, the distance will cause ""limited insight on ground conditions"". The thick atmosphere would prevent photography to be clear and decipherable. Another negative is that the scientists have no way to collect any samples from the surface for evidence. Flying above the atmosphere would get the astronauts close, but it would be ineffective.

Each day, scientist work hard to come up with new materials and ideas to achieve their goal to successsfully explore Venus. Even though there are many dangers because of the harsh atmospheric and surface conditions, scientists and astronauts work towards this goal because they are determined and believe it is possible to overcome these obstacles to get to what they've worked hard for.

This author believes that the discovery of the true venus , hidden from the naked eye, will benfit the future of science, even with the danger staring them in their face.

The author believes that Venus is special because , it's basically the ""twin"" of earth, which means they might have had life on the surface. According to paragraph 4 it states ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth.""(TCOEV), Which fueled the minds of the scientists , because they just wanna know what was on the surface of venus. But, with a goal there is also road bumps, one of them is the fact that venus enviorment is crucial. According to paragraph 3 it states venus has a ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus ... temperatures average over 800 degress...liquefy many metals.""(TCOEV), which is extremely dangerous. But later in the article they stated ""venus have value...expandes to meet very edges of imagination and innovation"" which show that they can gain knowledge in later visits, and advance their technolgy.

The author of 'The Challenge Of Exploring Venus"" explaines why studying Venus is helpful in many ways. Even though you might say ""what if the people get injured or possibly die""

he provided details of how there is many diffrent ways they can carry out the mission. So, next time that you are setting a just never give up , even if you come cross a challege.      ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
9D20FA86282F,"Humans. One of the many smart species on planet earth. The species that seems to think they can do anything, including going to Venus. Although Venus is highly dangerous with its high temperatures and extreme clouds of carbon dioxide, it is a worthy pursuit that could be a great benefit for the knowledge of anybody living on earth.

The information that could be gathered is rather incredible. Already this world knows a few features Venus holds, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" It is so amazing to think that already we have this idea of a planet. With hard work and dedication it could be valuble, to further investigate our sister planet. Even though the conditions the planet are critical, we know the dangers. There is a benefit to the planet, ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author knows what to say, because they know that the conditions are harsh. And great reward the sccientists recieve what they would need from this raging planet.

The value of this planet is not known only because there is not enough strive to make it happen. The ""human curiosity"" is what leads this planet to greatness. Scientist that want this mission, have to be willing to do whatever it takes for knowledge. They have to ""get up close and personal despite the risks."" Those risks will lead to everything that a scientist could hope for. There is no reason to not believe the author when they say the mission will be worth your while. Only because there is something magnificent about that planet so similar to ours. the author so confidently states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" They so beautifully say what is needed. Imagaination and the need to innovate, for future greatness, is so important for the challenges ahead. Although this world still has unknown factors, finding out incredible things about Venus could change science, and could change the world itself.

Venus is our sister planet, one of the closest to us. How has our natural kick for curiosity not taken over? Humans always want to know everything. Making it clear, there is no point in just letting this fantastic adventure wait. Danger is always a component in exploring something new, that is why humans are knowledgable and powerful. So scientist should not hold back, they need to bring all their smarts to this adventure, and really make something great. It could result in the most indulging finds.

Another method the author claims is using a mechanical computer to handle the conditions. It's a good method, but it doesn't support HOW it can be used on Venus. The last method is using a blimp/plane-like aircraft to monitor Venus. It's a great method to study more about the atmosphere, but as it states ""reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas , or anything else, from a distance"" hindering the option of a thorough mission.

59838390BF45,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author attempts to convince the reader that studying Venus is worth all the dangerous problems one would face trying to study the beautiful planet.

The author starts off his argument by stating how ""challenging"" it is to examine Venus at a close proximidy, and procides to state all the factors of studying Venus and explain why it is so dangerous to explore this planet. The author first states facts about Venus that would affect a mission to the surface. These comments are mostly about it's atmosphere, stating that the thick atmophere is ""almost 97% carbon dioxide"" and contains high amounts of sulfuric acid, which as a result, causes the temperature to average at ""over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."" And to top that off, the atmospheric pressure is ""90 times greater then planet Earth's,"" suggesting that a submarine that was made to endure Earth's deepest parts of the ocean would be crushed on planet Venus. Later on, the author explains why we should even try to learn more about this supposedly miss understood planet. The author claims that astronomers are ""fascinated"" by Venus because they believe that it could have been the planet most like Earth in the solar system at one point in the past; possessing ""large oceans"" and being able to ""support various forms of life,"" and that even now Venus still has traits that could hint to the idea that it used to be a lot like Earth, such as having a ""rocky sediment"" surface, along with valleys, mountains, and craters. Although the author could have gone more into depth in this subject; inferring that astronomers should study Venus' surface because humanity wants to know why this change may have happened, and if we could avoid Earth following the same path, his argument as to why we should study Venus' surface is highly valid and valued as a strong reason despite the dangers.

Overall, the author of the passage, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" has a strong, thought out reason why humanity should explore Venus close up in the years to come.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
A9D670ADCE41,"So ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a great little short story that includes very interesting facts and it's all on how to go about studying the planet Venus despite the dangers. That's not even half of it either in other words let me give you some knowledge that I have gained from this wonderul author.

And this is where I'll tell you about the why scientists are still discussing further visits to the planet, so it say's in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" that it once long ago may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system then also Venus still today has a surface of rocky sediment besides that includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters fun fact Venus is called our ""Sister Planet"".

Now let's go to some of the reason's why human-beings aren't able to survive on Venus basically the story say's venus average temperatures are on average eight-hundred fahrenheit,the atomspheric pressure is also 90 times greater than what we experience from here on earth there for as you can see the conditions are too extreme for humans to survive on the planet.

Furthermore let's talk about how NASA plans to study Venus. So NASA's solution is like imagin a bimp-like vehicle hovering thirty-plus miles above Venus to avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up there, but it doesn't mean it's not going to hot it will be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit and thje air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth.

Finally for this conclusion I will just voice my own opinon about the short story on ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the thing I liked about the story is that it wasn't that hard to break everything down in to a little essay but besides that it was good and very informational story.

Since there not been a successful space air craft that survived the landing for than a few hours. issues explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Venus's reputation as a challenging plant for humans to study. The planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.

Venus is a hard planet to explore on giving the fact that its 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed on Earth levels. Temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Most importantly researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Many of our researchers are working on making innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. Other studies show that NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted up to at least three weeks in such conditions. By comparison systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure and heat and in all other forces.

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" would take more than a few years for our researchers to figurer a way to collect the data from the planet. NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. Venus has value not because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself. But also because of human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

7D3DD53F46D2,"Studying Venus is a great idea. We study Venus because it was like the twin to earth they are very close in size and density. if anything was to happen to the earth we as humans would want a fall back plan and somewhere to be able to go if anything bad happens on earth. Scientist are trying to find ways to get spacecrafts on venus for longer then a few hours.

Venus has a bad environment. they have 97% carbon dioxide blankets in their atmosphere also their clouds have sulfuric acid in them and some of there temperatures hvae reached up to 800 degrees fahreneit. This isnt good because it is 90x worse then what ernesoerience om our planet. Venus has the hottest suface temperature of any planet in our solar system. I know what you are thinking why would we want to live on venus with all bad things on the planet but its the most earth like planet in our system it was covered with oceans just like earth and could have supported forms of life just like earth does.

Our technology isnt good enough to withstand the environment on venus right now. NASA wants to make a blimp like vehicle that could float in the air instead of the ground. This could help with seeing through the clouds and still finding out and seeing whats going on when horrible storms come around. thsi is also not a good idea though because being up innthe air you would have to see the surface. Lots and lots of researchers are trying to find ways to make machines that could help us study venus.

Venus would be a good back up plan for if anything happens on earth and we need a place to live after. I support the idea of trying to make ways for us humans to live on Venus.

6D7F21FED149,"Venus may be easy to spot in the nightsky, being nicknamed the ""evening star,"" but it's not so easy to examine. There have been attempts to land spacecrafts on the planet; however, none have survived more than a couple hours. There are many factors that contribute to the difficulty of exploring Venus, but that won't stop NASA from trying to get as much information that they can get. The author thinks that it would be beneficial to explore Venus, but is it really worth trying to explore the planet despite all of the difficulties?

What factors exactly make the exploration of Venus so difficult? Although Venus may once have been ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,"" it no longer appears to be that way. According to the article, the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and the clouds contain highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Also, the average temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These conditions are nothing like ones that are found on Earth. This environment would crush a submarine and would liquify metals, as stated in paragraph 3. Along with the atmospheric difficulites, weather difficulties also present themselves. The article states that volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes would be a danger to anything looking to land on Venus's surface.

With all these difficulties, how was NASA planning on examining the planet? NASA wanted to study the planet from above. They want to send a vehicle to hover over Venus in order to avoid the ground conditions, as stated in paragraph 5. However, this would limit the amount of information NASA could collect about the ground conditions of the planet and would restrict them from bringing back any samples.

Overall, I don't think think it is worth trying to explore Venus with all these difficulties, and I don't think the author did a good job supporting the idea that it would be beneficial. If anything, I think the author explained why trying to explore Venus would be nothing but harmful. In the artcle, the author discusses the dangers of trying to explore Venus much more than the benefits we would gain. The author provides no imput as to why we should explore the planet other than the fact that curiosity is what lead people to wanting to explore it in the first place. If people took the time to explore everything they were curious about, nobody would have a life and imaginations would be pointless. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

Venus is the hottest next to the sun the atmosphere is not easy living conditions but is bareable for human life. The text states, NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float aboe the fray. The author states, at thirty-plus miles above the suface, temperatures would still be toasty at around170 degres Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to the sea level on earth. The text lastly states solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed earth levels,the conditons are not easy, but is survivable fo humans. The text lastly states, a vehicle can hover over venus far better then a human can and avoid the unfriendly ground conditons. This states why venus is not safe for human life but survivable to withstand.

What scintist find so valuable on venus is the variouse form of life and the land that is inhabiting on it. The texts states, Astronomers are facinated by Venus because it may well pnce have been the most Easrth like planet in our solar system. The author states, Long ago Venus was probably covered largly with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. The text lastly states, The planet has suface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters. This concludes why scientist find Venus so valuable to sacrfice human life to travel to Venus.

The other ways that scientist are approaching for venus is by using technolgy the can withstan the velocity of Venus. The author states, For example, some simplified electroics made of silicon carbide have been tested on a chamber stimulating the chaos of Venus suface. The texts states, modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delictate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. The author lastly states, By comparison technolgy can be more resistant to pressure,heat,and other forces. This shows the many other ways scientist have thought about other then using human life to research about planet earth

This also proves that since there are dense clouds formed around the inside of Venus' atmosphere you can barely see through it which means that you wouldn't be able to get any pictures or videos, and if you did manage to get a clear look at Venus' ground you still wouldn't be able to take a picture because light can't get through the dense clouds in Venus' atmosphere.

The author claims that Venus is the closest in size and density, in comparison to Earth. He then talks about how Earth, Mars and Venus are all planetary neighbors. Since Venus is one of the closest to us, He claims that it is one of the easier planets to explore.

The author in this article supports this idea very well by including details about how venus is dangerous.

The author begins by talking about Venus' history as a planet. He referrs to it as Earth's ""twin"" becasue of the planet's simmularities. The author says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This sentence helps develope the authors point of how Earth and Venus are twins. Before this though, the author described how dangerous Venus has become and how it has almost become impossible for scientists to send a robot to the planet. Although, the author does say that it wouldn't be impossible to live there. The author also says that if a vehicle hovered about thirty or so miles above the suface, temperatures would be hot, but the pressure would be the accuivalent to sea level on Earth. After this, the author includes that solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth's levels. After this, the author moves on to show what scientists are doing to study the planet so that maybe one day we can live there, or atleast visit for a longer period of time. Scientists are studying older technologies that do not use electricity, but can calculate number and withstand harsh conditions. One example the author uses of this is the mechanical computer. After this, the author goes into detail about how it was used in world war two and how with the right metal, it could possibly withstand Venus' conditions. To finish off the paragraph, the author talks about how modern computer that use electricity are often more delicate, to show why the scientists are using this older technology.

One piece of technology is also getting better as years go on, and that is space techonolgy and transportation. NASA has created an idea to be able to live close to the hosstile conditions of Venus; in which, people would live on blimp-like vehicle over the planet itself. Venus's climate and terrain might be an issue to the growing pursuit that people and companies (like NASA) are making towards travilling to Venus. That's not to say that the study and travel towards the planet can have pros and cons.

The weather on Venus is more perilous than anything we could think about on Earth.

On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" With the facts of how dangerous it is on Venus, it is insane to think of anyone who would want to travel to and study the planet of Venus.

On the other hand, NASA and the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" think the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit. In paragraph 4 of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author says, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well one have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system...Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.."" While the conditions of our neighboring planet, Venus, seem to outweigh the history of the symetry that our planets once were; exploration and the study of Venus might be a worthwhile cause.

Even without the traveling to Venus, companies and astrologist can still learn a great deal about the atmosphere of Venus without putting their lives at risk. In the concluding paragraph of ""The Challenge of exploring Venus,"" the author breifly talks about how studying the planet of Venus can benefit the intellingence of our world.

Although our neighboring planets are inhospitable of human life, however ; Astronomers are fascinated about Venus because it may once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago Vinus was covered with oceans and could have supported various froms of life. Even today, Venus have some features that are analogous to those on the Earth. Human's have sent plethora number of spacecrafts to Venus but didn't get success. NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to the study Venus. NASA's possible solution to hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray, as the temperature would be around 170 degrees Farhrenheit above that land, it will make easier for humans to research on Venus. To get samples of rock or gas, scientists has to conduct a mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and persional despite the risks. NASA has discovered that electronic devices made of silicon carbide can last for three weeks on Venus as they will not melt easily. NASA and many other organizations are working hard to make it possible for human to visit other planets.

As we know, how many different condition are becoming hindurance for humans to visit Venus, but we are no longer away from the time when human will visit other planets and will research about that planet. Recently scientists has discovered that their is a life possible on Mars. Many organizations like NASA and Space-X are working hard to send humans to Mars. Similarly we will find the way to land on Venus and know more about it. Our travels beyond the Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
82ED15238FD1,"There is a great challenge when it comes to exploring the planet Venus. However, some may believe that studying the planet is worth taking the risks that are inevitable. The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers presented, by providing examples of the harsh conditions and new solutions to those conditions.

The author supports the idea that Venus is worth exploring by stating that astronomers are very intruiged by Venus because of it's similarity to planet Earth. The author also discusses that after the exploration of Venus, more intimidating conquests will be able to take place. After explaining this, the author then explains the dangers presented on Venus. For example, Venus has very high temperatures and sulfuric acid in it's atmosphere. To counteract against these challenges, NASA has the idea of using a blimp-like vehicle to avoid the hostile atmosphere and temperature. Another challenge would be the inability to use modern computers on Venus because of the harsh conditions. However, a solution to this would be the use of mechanical computers. The author elaborated on this idea by stating that, ""...mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"". These are just two solutions from the researchers at NASA that can be used to combat the conditions Venus provides.

The author strengthed the idea by using various examples and providing concrete evidence. The author also provided facts from NASA as well as solutions to the challenges that arise from the conditions on Venus. This was done by elaborating on new technology that can be used despite the hostile conditions. This further strengthens the author's idea that the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to exploring Venus. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
E145EE17F740,"Venus is a planet were scientis are explorig to see if they can create another Earth. Therefore they have than some experiments to see how long things can survive. There are many good reason why studing Venus is worthy. One of the reasons is because Venus is the closest planet to Earth, Venus still has some features that are alike to Earth, and solar power would be plentiful.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth,which can be an advanage because we could have a more population, and more place to travel and see different types of culture. In the text it says that ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in distance too"" this maens that the other planets are further than Venus. In text it also says that ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit"". This is telling us that we have more option to visit.

The planet of Venus looks more alike to Earth than you think some scientist belive that Venus had larges amounts of water. The text satates that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth .This shows us that this is why scientist are exploring this specific planet, because it look very alike to Earth. in text it also says that ""The planet (Vunus) has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. It shows us how similar this planets are.

Another adventage is that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Aaccording to the text it says that ""Solar power would be plentiful, and radiatio would not exceed Earth levels"" This could help by not using electronics or else the materials would melt.

One important fact is that no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours, but scientis are working hard they say that it won't be on easy conditions but it would be survival for humans. If there happens to be life in Venus the temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit.   ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

Stated in the article ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" the quote could teach us what not to do or we could end up near or similer to Venus.

Disigning better stronger drones that survive harder condicions such as Venus is a good thing because there could be other planets that could require that type of drone. Stated in the article ""coulds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.""

Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy condiotions but survivalbe for humans."" Venus can be suitable for humans, it just would be very difficult starting off. Soon enough humans would adapt to the hostile environment of Venus.

Venus is very hostile. Humans would not be able to survive on an atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon dioxide. It's clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acid, and temperatures are averaged over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. It would take a very great amount of effort to make Venus a new home.

My first reason is that not many people survive for hours. My second reason is that the conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth. My third reason is that technology tends to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.

"" Each previos mission was un manned, and for good reasons, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" When they are flying and trying to land carefully, and they are in the ground the spaceship might end up exploting.

F773A9CD1AB8,"As a young child peers into the endless night sky from his bedroom window, a bright flickering spot catches his eye and leaves a single question in his mind: ""Is there anybody there?"" In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author writes about that same bright spot, known as Venus, and explains that studying this planet will real human scientists is worth it despite the many obstacles it raises. By including staggering information of the endless hazards and later reassuring their readers with astonishing facts and likely solutions to survival, the author clearly supports their ideas very well. There may just be a chance for us to see Venus as more than just a bright little star after all.

Initially, the author puts more focus to the first half of their claim as they describe the dangers of this not-so-easy planet. The author informs us that even mighty submarines would not stand a chance in the undoubtably strong Venusian atmosphere; they continue to say that most metals would simply melt under its pressure (paragraph 3). By including such daunting information that makes human life anywhere near Venus seem impossible, it can easily be seen that the author supports that Venus is no cake-walk. Also in paragraph three, the author includes ""additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes"" in the background of Venus's already packed daily weather forecast. The author used these earthly disasters and explained how they happen regularly on Venus to prove just how many abstacles there are for scientists who wish to go to the planet, furthure showing their understanding of the idea that putting humans of Venus could be very harmful. Thankfully, exploring this scary planet has its hopeful side.

Near the middle of this passage, the author begins to turn Venus, no pun intended, and the conversation on taking humans there to a more positive angle. In paragraph four, the author writes about how Venus most likely used to be much like the place we currently live; it had amazingly Earth-like characteristics like huge oceans, mountains, and possibly even life similar to ours. With such exciting facts that leave even more questions about the mysterious planet, the author is proving to us that they know Venus has secrets worth uncovering. The author later tells the readers of a plan by NASA to make is possible to harbor human scientists near the Venusian surface by using a ""blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles [above Venus]..."", informing that the situation would in fact be viable for life (paragraph 5). The author showed how they highly agree with the part of their idea that analyzing Venus up close should happen by giving a reassuring soulution from such a well known and trusted organization as support. Exploring our planet's twin seems like it's not such a giant leap anymore, rather, it looks like it will only take a few small steps.

Keeping all of this information in mind, it is clear that the author is a firm beleiver that Venus, although it has put many seemingly impenatrable obstacles in our way, is worth taking a look at with human eyes. If we follow calls to action such as this, we will put the human race just that much closer to understanding the mysteries of the infinite universe around us, but Venus is a good starting point.

7EDFBE24CF70,"In "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus is interesting, helpful, and it is safe. The passage tells about how the planet Venus can improve and is useful. Venus could be dangerous, but there are many more reasons that Venus is a good oppurtunity to research on. There are many new discoveries not yet found.

There are many interesting things about Venus. First of all, Venus is the second planet from our sun. In paragraph 2, it states,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Second of all, Venus atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. The conditions are far more extreme than what human encountered. Third of all, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. There might be additional volcanoes and powerful earthquakes. Last of all, Venus is called the "" Evening Star.""

Venus is a helpful planet because of its characteritics. First of all, often Venus is refered to as Earths ""twin"". By stating that its saying that the planet Venus is just like the planet Earth. Second of all, If Venus is the same as Earth, then it would be possibe for people to visit and see the place. In paragraph 3 It states that,"" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" Third of all, it has higher carbon dioxide, so it is helpful for us. Last of all, Venus might be useful to us someday in the future.

The planet Venus is a safe place because of all the facts that is stated in the passage. First of all, If Earth is a safe place for us, then Venus would be too. Even the astronomers are fascinated of how much both the planets are alike. Second of all, Venus could someday be our second home or a place where we can visit. In the passage it states, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" Third of all, Venus is safe because the NASA has been doing experiments and testing on stuffs. NASA has been experimenting it on with inventions. Last of all, scientists even seek to conduct a thorough mission about Venus. By doing that scientists can understand more aboout the planet.

11FA7B00B4C6,"People often wonder when the world is going to end; will humans need a new place to live? Scientists have been researching alternatives to living on earth, such as living on mars or venus. Both planets would need some modifications before humans would be able to take residence but both planets are possible alternatives for when earth decides to die. The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" explains some of the difficulties scientists have to deal with when trying to explore venus. The author of this article shows his readers that by using maybe older technology mixed with newer thinking the scientists at NASA might be able to penetrate Venus' surface long enough to get the samples they need and in return protect the lives of their astronauts.

Scientists at NASA have been trying to figure out how to penetrate the atmosphere of Venus without losing any lives. They have come up with ideas like sending astronauts about 30 miles above venus to get some samples, the only problem being that getting samples would be next to impossible (pararaph 5). The reason for this being is that the men simply can reach down to the surface becuase the temperatures are over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the high pressure is enough to crush a submarine into a dime (paragraph 3) Not only that but the weather on the surface is absolutley horrendus, presenting errupting volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightening strikes (paragraph 3). These lightening strike have proven a problem for probes sent up to the surface of venus becuase they just get shocked and are no longer of use.

Luckily for our dying planet though, NASA is working on creating a simple and sturdy machine to go up and collect samples, the last one they tested lasted up to three weeks in their simulaiton of Venus (paragraph 7). Another way they are modifying these machines is by using older technology becuase it does not require electronics, and without the electronics you get out the risk of lightening destroying the million dollar toy (paragraph 7). A good thing about using mechanical parts versus electronic parts is that mechanical parts are said to be, ""more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" (paragraph 7).

By using mechanical machines NASA can ensure the safety of the astronauts and get the samples they need to discover is Venus is in fact, a habitable plantet. The author shows this by explaining how using austronauts simply is not enough and that by combining older technology and newer thinking that scientists at NASA can penetrate Venus' serface and discover if it is habitable. If NASA combines their thinking with the older, and sturdier technology the advencements they could make would be tremendous. They could discover is Venus is habitable and possibly be able to modify it they way they need to so venus can become habitable. If the process does not work with venus they could use their research on mars or possiby other planets in the solar system. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

A550B41E7CD7,"Why explore Venus? Is it not dangerous, and scary, and hot? What could it possibly have that Earth has not already given us? Well, Venus is much more like Earth than most people like to think. And personally, between you and I, I think they are scared of the opportunity to leave their comfortable homes and Cheetos. Venus could be crucial for Earth, and we are about to find out why.

Here is a hypothetical scenario. Tomorrow, we find out it is too late to stop global warming, and we have twenty years to evacuate the planet, or we die with it. Scientists everywhere panic! 'Oh no! We don't have anywhere to go!' Then, NASA steps in, like a really protective dad, 'fear not, children. We can be safe on Venus.' Everyone responds happily, until they process the situation. 'Wait, did you say Venus?! We would never last in such a desolate, violent place!' Well, you're wrong buddy. And science can vouch for me. Venus isn't so different from Earth. At least, it didn't used to be. Scientists who have made successful missions to Venus with droids have found traces of oceans, valleys, mountains, you name it! There have been many, many signs on Venus of Earth-like conditions! The article states that Astronomers have reason to believe Venus was actually more Earth-like than Mars! It amazes and confuses them! On top of Venus being just like us, it would be easily acessible. After all, it is just a few light years away.

Venus, while very desolate, and violent, has also shown signs of possibly being able to support life as we know it. Scientists would like to keep their manned missions above the violent weather conditions, making it easy for them to study the surface of the small planet. The traces of water and weather left behind provide a sense of comfort for humans, knowing that if Venus was a last resort, they would be safe and secure.

Now, in order for Venus to truly be acessable, in those hypothetical twenty years, we would have to make major technological advances. We would need transportation, protection, shelter, amongst many other things. However, Venus does provide some of the things we need, or keeps us safe from what we should avoid. Venus provides a close position to the sun, which, while still very hot, leaves plenty of wiggle room for solar energy, utilized by us! Not only would that power us, but it would also keep us from ruining another planet! The air pressure in the atmosphere is similar to that of sea level on Earth, which would be ideal for the young, and the old. Additionally, Venus provides protection from harmful radiation, much like Earth! What's not to love about avoiding radiation?

Venus is a strong, beautiful, powerful and incredible planet. It can protect us, serve us, and make us feelm safe. While there are some disadvantages, I'd argue that there are more advantages. Who wouldn't? Humans act on their curiosity, with no regard for danger or doubts. In this growing age of technology, how could we? I'd keep an open mind on space exploration.

359A9D4CB730,"Have you ever wondered what are some of the true dangers of exploring Venus? Venus is a broiling hot planet due to it being the second farthest planet from the Sun, which is our closest star.

Scientists have created multiple technological devices, but have they created enough for them to explore planets, such as Venus. Did you know people say Venus is a female planet.

In case the reader has not yet figured it out, this essay is about the planet in our solar system known as Venus.

Venus has a bad reputation and for a pretty good reason. No spaceship has ever landed there, neither has a space craft and survived for more than a few hours. This is because of the toxic gases that suround Venus. Its been three decades, thirty years, since scientists attempted to try to land another spaceship on Venus. This is because those toxic gases that suround Venus are ninety-seven percent of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acids, which is deadly for any living organisms' lungs from planet Earth. Planet Venus's toxic atmosphere makes it difficult for us humans to explore Venus.

Venus has many other dangers to explore this planet as well. Weather, Natural Diasters beyond what Earth's people has ever seen, heat, and its's atomospheric pressure. Venus may be farther away from the Sun by Mercury is the first closest planet to the Sun and is cooler than Venus. Venus's average temperature is over eight-hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any other planet in our entire solar system. Venus has an atmospheric pressure that is ninety times greater than what we experience on Earth, our home planet. Venusian geology shows Venus has natural diasters including erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequently occuring lighting strikes. The lighting could easily get to Venus's surface.

Venus has many other dangers to explore this planet as well. Weather, Natural Diasters beyond what Earth's people has ever seen, heat, and its's atomospheric pressure. Venus may be farther away from the Sun by Mercury is the first closest planet to the Sun and is cooler than Venus. Venus's average temperature is over eight-hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Venus has the hottest surface temperature than any other planet in our entire solar system. Venus has an atmospheric pressure that is ninety times greater than what we experience on Earth, our home planet. Venusian geology shows Venus has natural diasters including erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequently occuring lighting strikes. The lighting could easily get to Venus's surface.

Despite these life-threatening dangers for scientists, it would amazing to explore Venus because it is something no human has ever done before. 1st sentence. It would be a worthy pursuit for sure. It would also be a lot of hard work just to discover how any human would be able to survive landing on Venus to explore it. It would be amazing as well to do something like this because future generations of people would know if they believe and work hard enough that they can do anything they set their mind to do. Anything is possible.

This essay was on Venus, a very dangerous planet. Venus is a dangerous planet becaus Venus is toxic. Venus is also full of hot weather and natural diasters. Those natural diasters are much more extreme than anything Earth has experienced or the people on Earth has and will ever see. Mercury is even cooler than Venus and Mercury is even closer to the Sun. Venus is a dangerous planet, but it would be well worth being able to finally explore.      ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

Is Venus worth the risk to explore? maybe so. Venus has so many things to offer, evening star, many out of the world features, and a thick atmophere. Doesn't mean we should kill ourselves trying, I think venus is not worth the try.

First and formost, the evening star, is the brightest point in the sky. Venus also makes it simple to stargazing. Venus is the second planet and the next closest plant next to earth. Stargazing is all fun and games on earth, but if you go to venus you may burn.

Also, Venus has a very thick atmophere. It's almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets around Venus. On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit, and the pressure of the atomsphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on planet earth.

Lastly, Venus's light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography ineffective. Most importantly, reseachers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else in that matter. Many people are working on innovations thta would allow our machines to last longer to contribute to our knowledge.

Venus should be left alone, just as we would want to be. Venus is a harm to all man kind who try and rescach on Venus. If it was a safe idea to go up there would have already done it by now. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
EB8B27A81300,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" thinks that exploring Venus is worth the risks that are required. Venus is a planet that most people think are a star because of how brightly it shines at night which makes it very noticeable. Not many other things are known about Venus: Not many people think about exploring Venus when they think of space exploration. In the article the author talks about both the problems with exploring Venus, but he also talks about how exploring Venus is something that is a possibility for the future.

The author states that Venus is ""often referred to as Earth's 'twin'"" because out of all the planets Venus has a similar density and size compared to Earth. The terrain of Venus is also very similar to the terrain of Earth. They both have landmarks that are similar ""to familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" This evidence shows how the landscape of Venus has the possibility to be a home for humans. The similarities between Earth and Venus make Venus a valuable place to explore in greater depth.

Although Venus has a similar terrain to Earth, the ground climate is too rough for anyone to safely land in Venus. Venus has a temperature that humans can not survive in, 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Also on Venus the pressure is 90 times what humans experience on Earth. Humans have never experienced conditions as extreme as those on Venus: ""Even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of [the] oceans"" would be crushed and the high temperatures ""would liquefy many metals."" Something that was made to be able to go withstand high pressures, like a submarine, would be crushed on Venus, and metals can withstand very high temperatures but on venus they would liqeufy. It is unsafe and humanly impossible for humans to try to explore the land of Venus when some of the best technology can not even withstand the climate of Venus.

As of now there is not enough technology for humans to explore Venus on the surface, but they can explore Venus from above. It is a possibility for scientists to hover 30 miles above Venus. This way the scientists will not have to experience the total wrath of Venus's surface, but they would experince ""temperatures that would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, [and] the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" Humans can live in those conditions, even though they may not be ideal. Scientists would be able to explore Venus without putting them at risk. There is still not technology for the scientists to throughly explore Venus the way they want to. They would only get a glimpse into what Venus is like. New inivations are being worked on that can withstand Venus's tumultous surface, so that scientists can get the full picture of

Venus.

Venus has great potential for exploration, but with that great potential comes great risk. The author of the article talks about the problems with exploring Venus, but he also talks about how exploring Venus is something that is a possibilty for the future. Venus is very similar to Earth in the terrain that they both have, but the surface conditions of Venus are deadly to humans. There is the possibilty of hovering above Venus to be closer to the surface without having to experince the extreme conditions. With the advancements in technology and new innovations scientists are hoping that there is a way for them to get closer to the surface without endangering their lives.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
E2A544B069F1,"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents, the reason why is because this is the closest planet that is somewhat like earth. So we NASA wants to know how relateable we are to Venus.

In paragraph 3 it tells on how dangers Venus is. It says in the article ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere. On the planet surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."" from those sentences it shows on how dangers Venus is. Also earlier in paragraph 2 it says ""Each previous misson was unmanned and ofr good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landinf for more than a few hours"". thats how dangerous Venus is which is a reason why scientists are scared.

But the prize is worth it if we get the knowledge on how Venus is, in paragraph 8 it says ""Striving to meet the challenge presebted by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be ganied on the planet itself, but also becasue human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Which means we can go to other planets because we wearn't scared with Venus and we shouldn't have doubt for us humans because we would always find a way to do something. So if we do explore Venus and it goes great we could go to other bigger planets.

In paragraph 4 it says ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may have once been the most earth-like planet in our solar sytem"" which is another reason why scientists want to reserch Venus is because Venus is somehwhat alike our planet the earth. Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various froms of life it's just like earth. So they want to explore Venus because it's almost just like earth.

Even though Venus is very dangerous it's worth the trip to explore it, even though its not easy conditions, its survivable for humans so scientists are still going to discuss further visits to Venus the ""Evening Star""    ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
898FF484856E,"To start with, the challenge of exploring Venus is that it's more then just one challenge it's several. There are terrible weather conditions, ninty times the pressure we have on our planets, clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, and a ton of other challenges.

Frist of all, the heat conditions on the planet Venus are close to eight times the heat that we've ever felt on our planet. The average tempeture on Venus is around eight hundred degrees Farenheit every day. This heat could melt some of the metals that we have on our planet, Earth. On days that are around ninty degrees on our planet it is very hot imagine being in that heat but times eight. People would die from the heat of that planet and this is one reason why it makes it such a great challenge to explore Venus.

Second, according to paragraph 3 of the article it states ""the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Living on this planet seems to be complety insane! The pressure on this planet could liquefy many of our metals.

If a submarine made to dive to the deepest depths in our ocean went there the water would crush and liquify almost the entire thing. Swiming to low in our planet can pop your ears and possibly even burst your ear drum imagine what swimming on that planet would be like; considering if you could even swim due to the weather.

lastly, the heat, and the pressure are not the only things you need to worry about. Venus's geology and weather has additional problems like powerful earthquakes, erupting valcanoes, and lightning strikes that destroy probes. It wouldn't be possible to get a submerine to the water on Venus without it getting struck by lightning first. These weather conditions are terrible and impossible to work with.

The article states ""at thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth."" These conditions are horrible and the people wouldn't even be on the planet. This is by far one planet that would be very challenging to abserve and even be around.

To conclude, everything about exploring Venus is challenging! The heat is far hotter than anything that humans have ever delt with. The pressure could crush submarines meant for going to the depest depths in our world. Imiagine what it could do to humans.

These aren't even the only problems, clouds cover Venus and these clouds are no regular clouds; they're clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid.

Not only this but Venus has the hottest surface tempetures and it's not even the planet closes to the sun. These are some of the greatest challenges of exploring Venus.   ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

58C0A6CCE89D,"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers very well.

He includes everything that the planet itself would benefit from it and the humans on earth.

He explains what evidence we could find, what we could explore and what may be out there that we do not know is in existance.

In paragraph 3 he says, "" these conditions are far more extreme than anything humas would encounter on earth"".

This shows that if we were able to land on Venus and actually get to explore than we could possibly figure out why Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our Solar System.

We could also explore the additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes on Venus.

In paragraph 4 it says that Venus may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our Solar System.

This just proves the authors point more that studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers because we could figure out how Venus was/is much like Earth and what they had/have in common. NASA already knows that there are still some features that are analogous to those on Earth such as a surface of rocky sediment, valleys, mountians and craters.

So by studying Venus we could know more in depth about these analogous features.

NASA has gone as far as finding substitutes for landing on the planet so we can still explore it.

This just goes to show how important it is to study Venus.

However doing so our research and evidence would not be as sufficient as it would if we could land on the planet.

If we did not land on the planet we could not collect samples of rock, gas, take close up photos, etc.

So in conclusion, it is very important that we study Venus not only because it is the most Earth like planet out there after Earth itself but also because it would bring much benefit.

It would bring benefit to the planet itself, but also to humans on Earth.

We are curious about what could be out there that we have not yet to explore.

Venus has some simularites to earth. The planet nicknamed ""Evening Star"" may have once been like the most Earth planet. For example, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.""

The author argues his point that studying Venus is a wothy pursuit despite the danger it presents by inform the data that collected by different reaserchers.

The article first described the climates and the condition on Venus, also how it is different on Earth. "" A think atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even moore challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" By giving out more information of a planet that is unknown to audience, it creates a more clear setting of what it is like on Venus.

After enough description of cruelty on Venus, it leads to author's point, ""If our sister plaet is so inhospitable, why ae scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"" He also gave out the reason in the next sentence,"" because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.""

In paragraph 4, he states that although Venus has more pressure and extreme hot temperature, there is still some features that are similar to Earth, such as valleys, mountains and craters on the surface of Venus, just like on Earth.

In paragraph 5, NASA's data was used as an evidence to prove author's point. Although the temperatures would be still a lot more higher than Earth, but the air pressure woud be close to the sea level on earth when it is at thirty-plus miles above the Venus' surface. This prove that it is survivable for human, just not easy conditions.

There are many dangers to this such as how hot and how unearth-like Venus really is today, but Venus used to be just like earth with many oceans and sea like creatures that we have on earth as well.

""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin"", Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occassionally the closest in distance too."" (paragraph 2) He then goes on to explain how Earth is sometimes ""right around the corner"" from Venus and because of this we have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on Venus. Since no aircraft would be able to last over a few hours, no man has ever been in these spacecrafts that get sent there. Scientists are discussing further visits to Venus because they are fascinated with how much Venus used to be like Earth. ""Long-ago Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" *(paragraph 4). Scientists have discovered that to this day Venus still has many of thsoe earth-like features and are wondering if there is any form of life on this planet.

Venus is so hot that it is one of the brightest points of the night sky which gives it the nickname ""Evening Star"" and it is really easy for stargazers to spot.

NASA is working on other ways of studing Venus such as silicon electronics that could withstand the 800 degree and 90 times greater atmospheric pressure that is on Venus.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author explains that studying Venus is a chance that people should be willing to take. The author goes on to support this idea. The author does a wonderful job at supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

Visiting Venus would open up opportunities for space exploration and understanding. Learning the landscape and other features would expand the knoweldge of scientists as well as astronauts. The author states, ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,"" (Paragraph 4). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is determined to discover more features of Venus in comparison to Earth, so much that they are planning to create a machine in order to survive the landing.

More experiments are being conducted with a plethora of approaches to survive the landing. NASA is anxious to set foot on Venus. NASA's current research consists of ""innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knoweledge of Venus,"" (Paragraph 6). NASA clearly views the exploration of Venus as necessary by assembling multiple machines in order to gain a better understanding of the planet itself. Determined to explore Venus, NASA is inventing machines that can withstand all dangers.

Dangers are a factor, starting with the extreme temperature difference. The temperature on Venus is about eight times hotter than Earth, meaning the chances of a human surving are slim to none. The weather on Venus consists of ""atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide... temperatures average over 800 degrees farenheit,"" (Paragraph 3). The conditions of Venus are far more drastic than many humans have ever experienced. However, the studies completed and the knoweledge gained are worth the struggles and hard work put in.

While dangers are present, the author makes it clear that the voyage is worth the risk. The trip would advance space exploration and grant scientists the oppurtunity to study unfamiliar life forms.

4871C747C8BB,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" has made their article over the progress of studies done on Venus, the ""Evening Star"" of our skies. They collected research and human planetary exploration of our solar system, and I'll be going over claims and their ideas of just how passionately they support their ideas of studying Venus despite dangers.

My evaluation of the successful writings the author had written is crucially on how they told about the difficulty of the mission would be on Venus, seeing as they inform us the tempatures on the planet average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, with atmospheric pressures there being a startling 90 times greater amount than our planet, and with all this there is little knowledge about what makes up the ground, water or gas of the planet. And with all the probes we've sent last only a few hours each within each landing. On our way to finding a way to overcome these challenges we found discoveries made on the way about future planet explorations that could someday be made by humans on Venus itself.

The author wrote that current discoveries made by scientists show that Venus also had a past of preserving life on its planet, and even having geological landscape features similiar to Earth. The planet's orbit provide nearby space travel making it a possible and easy route for planetary visits, which is crucial seeing how long space travel can take with our current modifications and technology. The article's author then backs this up on NASA's critical ideas and discoveries for sending humans to Venus for studies.

A solution the researchers have proposed for tells of a floating or a blimp transportation vehicle capable of carrying people over the potential dangerous landscape and acidic clouds for closer examination of the planet around 30 miles up in the air. Despite the distance, they would still be in 170 degrees Fahrenheit weather, with pressures close to sea-levels like on Earth, but solar power generation would be easy to obtain, and radiation levels are equal to the safe places of Earth's. Meaning for a difficult, but survivable enviroment for us humans to be in.

As invigorating as that may seem, They then tell on how undeveloped the idea still is, seeing as hovering over 30 miles would definitely avoid dangerous conditions, but also samples and direct contact with critical minerals and materials that could be discovered from below would make studies on the planet not as plentiful as it could be. Leaving options for a need to find ways for a closer, but riskier challenges to get the samples and materials they would need to make far by more accurate studies with the planet Venus.

They go on to tell us about machines capable of withstanding the tempatures capable of melting tin, which would be dire against tablets and cell phones we have on Earth, and how machines we've had designed in 1800's could survive with some modifications, or silicon carbide simplified electronics have been made to withstand the heat and acidic conditions.

44C55327E1CA,"The author does not support this claim well enough. In the passages, the author goes on about the many problems that are associated with exploring Venus. Most of the problems the author has listed are fatal to humans, making it impossible to achieve what the author obviously wants; to examine Venus throughly for humans to have enough information to finally inhabit the hot planet. Unfortunately for the author, many people would agree that this article does not support the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the obvious dangers well enough.

There are many problems stated in the article (paragraph 3) on why Venus is a very dangerous planet to explore. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in our solar system, even though the planet Mercury is far closer to the sun. The burning hot planet is also covered in 97 percent carbon dioxide, a lethal gas for living creatures on Earth, very much including humans. The planet's surface is an average of 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric is 90 times greater than Earth's. No human or any other living creature can survive in these conditions, not even with the technology we have today. The author adds that the planet's weather and physical conditions is quite capricious; volcano eruptions every now and then, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning attacks on the probes Nasa sends to Venus does not help the author's beliefs either. No spaceship has touched the planet in 3 decades, making the planet even more mysterious because of the changes that could have started during those 3 long decades.

The author then tries to turn the bad news around with what most would call, 'wishful thinking'. The article shows information of how Nasa has an idea of how they could get to Venus without immediatley dying and wasting resources. Of course, it is all but an idea. A theory, that cannot be tested accurately, neither without huge costs. The article also states of researchers who develop physically capable computers that might have a better chance of lasting longer on Venus with enough time to collect needed information. The truth of the matter is, these solutions are all just fantasies; ideas that we wish could be acted upon, but the world is far too complicated for that to happen so easily.

Human curiosity can do wonders for the world. That is not to be compared to miracles however, because that is what's needed to achieve the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit. Human's in general are capricious creatures, very much like Venus itself. We strive to learn and gain control of another planet, when the results clearly show that we cannot even take care of our own.

While the author is a positive thinker, their idea of Venus being a worthy pursuit is laughable. The article does not do well enough, or maybe at all, to convince that Venus is a worthy pursuit. There is too many problems with the idea, and too many factors to be played out, and not enough good solutions to help support the idea.

Information about how studying Venus can be very valuable is rarely provided.

The author does not adequately support their idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

Though the author of the article belives that studying Venus would be advantageous, the evidence provided is not strong.

In paragraph 4, the author writes that Venus is the ""most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" and ""could have supported various forms of life.""

The author does provide much context into these claims and only describes geographical features.

The author then does not mention this idea until paragraph 8.

They conclude the article with very similar statements as mentioned before.

The article does not contain information on why studying Venus would be valuable, but more so on why it is dangerous.

Most of the article describes and tells about the many dangers of studying Venus.

This directly contradicts the author's viewpoint.

In paragraph 2, the author provides evidence against their idea.

The text states, ""Each previous mission was unmaned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours,""

and ""Numerous factors contibute to Venus's reputation.""

When first reading the article, the text immediately leads the reader to believe that Venus is extremely dangerous.

The author includes many other shocking facts including, but not limited to, ""97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus... temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.. atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.""

Reasons such as these lead readers to form a negative opinion about the explorations of Venus.

Though the author does bring up different solutions to make a trip to Venus more safe, they also bring up why the solutions would not work.

For example, one solution includes floating 30 miles abouve the atmosphere.

However after describing this system, the next paragraph provides reasons why this would not work well.

As stated in paragraph 6, ""...researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance.

Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks.""

The author also notes that photography and videography would be ineffective.

Paragraph 7 also explains that modern computer can not work near Venus's surface as the high temperatures melt most of the metals.

Though the ideas that the author brings up are valid, they are discredited, weakening the points.

ABE633932976,"The article that is called ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is about the dangers that you could come upon if you go to or explore Venus. Some challenges that can come with when exploring Venus, are temputure, gravity, its atmosphere, body damage, or even death. There have been many mission that scientists have planned to go to Venus.

The first danger that Venus definately has, is its thick atmosphere that's almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that blankets the planet. This is true, because it says ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" Also no scientists want to go there, because of the even more challenging clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the planet's atmosphere. This is also true, because the passage says ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.

The second danger that Venus's includes, is its very hot temputures. The passage talks about how the surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which could even melt a submarine at the bottom of the ocean, and its atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth's. Venus also has the hottest surface temputure out of all the planets in our solar system. These dangers are found from the passage and it says ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our planet."" ""...such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system..."".

Scientists now have been testing simplified electronics made from silicon carbide in a simulator that simulates the chaos of Venus's surface, and so far they have lasted weeks in those conditions. This was found in the passage and it says ""... some simplified electronics made of silicom carbon have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Another project the NASA is working on to get to the planet is a technology from the 1800's and played an important role during World War two, these devices make calculations by the use of gears and levers. This was also found in the passage and it says ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during World War II.""

Studying Venus is worth pursuing, because Venus is the closest planet to earth, Venus used to have oceans on it's surface, and

Venus is the most earth like planet in our solar system.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth. ""Venus is simple to see in the distant but safe vantage point from Earth, It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely""(1). This tells us that for a planet so close to us, we know nothing about it, and that he dont have a clue what we could do to study it. Venus has a thick and deadly atmostsphere,it is made up of 97 percent carbon dioxide and the clouds are made of acid This makes exploring very difficult to do. With some tweks to the rovers, or shuttles we could explore this unlown planet, and we could end our ceriosity.

Venus used to have oceans on it's surface. From the information that the author gave us on this subject we can tell that Venus may have been hapitable by life in the past but now it can not. But that answers the question for us that we might be the only life. If we go and study Venus the possiblitys are amazing for us.

Venus is the most earth like planet in our solar system. This is a great point made by the author, they really explained in depth how important it can be to study this mysterious planet. and it is worth exploring due to the three ideas that: Venus used to have oceans on it's surface, and Venus is the most earth like planet in our solar system.

Studying Venus has more pros than cons. Even though it will be a challenge, Striving to go and research/study Venus has its value. So mush intel will be gained on Venus, explaining its mystories; but ""also human curiosity will likly lead us to equality""(8). This will be our chance to prosper as a people, and grow as a race.

By carefully examining the text and pondering their ideas of the planets surface and difficuties of gaining access to venus , one could definitely say that yes, the author does support their idea very well. But this is a planet that can crush submarines like soda cans.

The author does prove some interesting points about the planets terrain and how we could work to develop technology for it. The author supports their ideas about the planet in a way that is hard for me to make an argument over, and uses information that is soid to the point where you don't want to try fact checking them. While they use counter arguments to violent conditions on the surface of the foreign planet, such as the idea of solar energy to use the powerful radiation. The author definitely knows what they are talking about, and sounds like they have some experience in debate.

The author claims that the limits of these terrifying endeavors should not be limited by the planets harsh conditions. The author also claims that the planet is hot enough to melt most types of metal. Those two statements counter each other due to the question of how we would get a material that can't melt in order to build safety equipment.

Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also becuase humans curiosity likely led us into many equally intimidating eneavors

One hink tha the author suggests that stufying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dengers it presents, is that many mission was unmannned and for good reason, since not spacecraft survived the landing for more that a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challening planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.

Another reason that the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers, is that. Aa thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more Challengingare the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 greater that what we experience on our own planet.

958BACFAF66B,"""The Challenging of Exploring Venus"", many scientists are wanting to exlpore Venus atmosphere. But it comes with risk and danger, possibly NASA scientists can break through that though, Venus is 'Earth's twin"", yet is a challenging planet for humans to study. Why? The thick atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus, with a tempature over 800 degrees Farenheit and an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than what we could or would ever expirence here on Earth. Not to mention the erupting volcanoes, powerful earhtquakes, frequent lightning, with the hottest tempature of any other planet; traveling would be indisputable. Venus at one point was ""Eath like"", the planet still has familiar features such as rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters.

Someway scientist have thought of some way to possibly research the mysterious planet, NASA has created a so called 'blimp' that would allow the scientists to be able to hover over Venus landscape 30 miles up. At 30 miles up, Venus would be at a 170 degrees Farenheit and pressure would be what it seems like at sea level on Earth. It is not easy conditions, but survivable for humans. Although, most forms of light can't penetrate the dense atmosphere, concerning standard forms of photography and videography ineffective or not clear. There would not be any samples of rock, gas, or anything else that would be of use. To have a thorough mission and search, you would have to get up close and personal, despite the risks, and danger. Creating a more resistant of objects that could sustain the pressure, heat and other forces. Venus is a difficult and dangerous planet to research, but perhaps one day scientists will be able to create the most effective way possible.

This adds on to why in Paragraph 3 that, ""on the pantes surface, tempatres average over 800 degrees Farhrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"".

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents; although, venus is very dangerous, Venus is known that it could of once been just like Earth. Even though its known that it could been just like Earth many years ago scientist still dont have enough evidence to proof that it was just like Earth many years ago.

Venus is often refered as Earth's ""twin"" because Venus is the closest planet to earth in density and size. If its like earth in many ways why is it so dangerous? Venus is the hottest planet out there; although Mercury is the clostes to the sun venus is still the hottset plantet in our solar system. Venus temperatures average over 800 degress Fahrenheit. These condition are very extreme that no human could live there if they wanted too.

""if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing futher visits to its surface?"", scientists or Astronomers are fascinated by venus because its the most earth-like planet in the solor system. Venus has rocky sediments on its surface and also has familar featrues such as vallys, craters, and mountians.

futhermore, NASA has been thinking of ways to figure out how we could get on Venus and maybe live there in the futrue. If NASA didnt think it was a good idea they wouldn't have kept trying to find ways to get there with no harm to the equitment or anything living. For example, NASA has been making simplified electronics made out of silicon carbide and has gone far enough to test them in venus like conditions to see posible ways to getting there safe.

In conclusion, Venus is very dangerous but it is worthy enough to try to study. Futhermore, NASA is still trying to find ways to get there which probably means it could be a good thing in the future and could benifit Earth someday.     ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
C48332F8ACB6,"Did the author support their idea well in this article? I do believe he did. I saw many reasons as to why we should at least try to go to venus. He gave many reasons as to how Venus is very simillar to Earth and could be inhabited one day. He also gave many reasons as to how it could be dangerous, and why people haven't really been able to do so yet. They mention things about what Venus has done to other space crafts in the past, and what it can do to others now even.

The author gives many reasons as to why Venus is reffered to as Earths ""twin."" He says, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" In this he tells us that Venus is like Earth in the ways of how dense it is and how large it is. He also says that it is occasionally close to us, so that shows us that it could be just like Earth, but with some differences. The author also says in paragraph 4, ""it may have once been the most Eath-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported many forms of like, just like Earth."" With this he is telling us that there could be fossils, or we could one day maybe inhabit Venus if needed, with adaptations of course.

The author also says that the journey would be dangerous. He mentions in paragraph 2 ""each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no space craft has survived the landing for more than a few hours."" In this he is telling us just how dangerous it is, because tipically you would think of a machine being tougher than the human body, but as you think about it you can see just as fast as that machine was destroyed. If that machine was destoryed so quickly imagine how quickly the human body would be. He also says ""not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" This also lets us know how hard it would be to get there and how fast, if the right materials aren't used, something can be destroyed during the trip.

The author then gives us NASA's plan as to how somebody would be able to access Venus in paragraph 5. He tells us that ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would be to allow scientists to float above the fray."" He gives us this idea so that we can think about it being a safer route and that maybe with this method somebody could be able to make it. With his evidence in the previous paragraphs we can conclude it would be very dangerous to land on Venus, but not to be above it. He also gives us a scenario of what it would be like for the scientists floating above. He tells us, ""a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up out of their way.. temperatures would still be toasy at arounf 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth... radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" By telling us this he is saying that it wouldn't be the most comfortable thing, but it would be liveable. He is showing us that it would be possible, and if they really wanted to, they could explore Venus.

In paragraph 8 he mentions that the ""scientist floating above would only give limited insignt,"" with this we can see that there still wouldn't be everythig solved, but we would still be closer than we've ever gotten. He also says in paragraph 8, ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" Meaning that the scientists wouldn't be able to photograph anything on Venus to look at later. The scientists would only be able to look at things closet than anybody ever has, but not be able to document any of it. With this we can also see that we wouldn't be able to see what Venus looked like from Earth, making it hard to report back on findings and research.

All in all I beleive the author did support his idea well. He gave the pros and cons and was able to explain everything out. I myself don't know it it would be worth all the money in supplies, but I do think with NASA's idea we can get closer than we've ever gotten before. The conditions would be liveable, but maybe a little uncomfortable, and we could get some good information on Venus. If Venus is as closely related to Earth as the author makes it out to be, then maybe it could be worth a shot, but I am still debating on it. It's nothing the author did, because he did explain and support everything very well, but I've always had very strong opinions on everything.    ",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8

Venus is known for having some of the harshest surface conditions of any planet in the solar system, so most would think exploring it would be impossible. That is not what the author of ¨The Challenge of Exploring Venus¨ believes. The author does not believe it will be easy to explore Venus, but does believe it is possible and worthwhile. Additionally, the author provides multiple reasons for exploring Venus with information to support them.

The author of ¨The Challenge of Exploring Venus¨ goes into great detail about the conditions and history of Venus. They explain everything from how Venus was nicknamed ¨Evening Star¨ to why it is so difficult to send probes to the surface that can function for long periods of time. They even delve into the theories that Venus was once an ocean planet, like early earth. They list some of the many natural disasters that can occur on the surface of Venus, such as earthquakes and eruptions. There are many hardships that would need to be faced in order to explore Venus, but according to this article it is not only possible but worthwhile.

The author also explains in ¨The Challenge of Exploring Venus¨ many of the possible methods that would need to be used to explore Venus safely. The author discusses many possibilites, such as having scientists float above the surface in a blimp. It may also be possible to send probes with more simplified electronics built with silicon carbide. Of course, all of these pathways would require a great deal of research, effort, and resources. So is exploring Venus even worthwhile?

The author explains many reasons for why exploring Venus is a good decision. First of all, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in the solar system. It would make sense for humanity to begin it´s exploration of space with Earth´s closest neighbor. It is also possible that Venus could have contained life at one point, since it likely once had vast oceans. Venus has a vey similar topography to Earth as well. The author supports all of these reasons with factual evidence in their article.

Exploring Venus would no doubt have many major hardhips to overcome, but the author of ¨The Challenge of Exploring Venus¨ explains perfectly why it is worth the effort.

Many scientist consider Venus as a planet like Earth in terms of density and size.

In the article says ""If or sister planet is so inhospitable,why are scientist even discussing further visists to it's surface?

Humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on Venus but Venus is all cloudy. Each and every mission was unnamed for a good reason, each of the spacecraft dissapeard after a few hours after the arrival on Venus. Not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in three decades for that exact reason. It gets to hard for humans to study, considering nothing can be there for more than just a few hours and its to dangerous to land there. To land or even to see people cant because the amount of clouds that cover Venus.

On the surface of Venus tempature average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than are own on Earth. Its would be way to extreme for us to even come close to even think of getting down there. And Venus has the hottest aurface temparture of any planet in our solar system although Mercury is closest to the Sun. Venus has a more likely chance of impacting Volcanoes, Powerful Earthquakes, and fequent lighting strikes.

C57E6EAB037F,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states very clearly how beneficial studying Venus would be, despite all the dangers. Even after learning how harsh the conditions are on ground level, for some reason, the author still believes the danger would be worth it. Though my own opinion may vary from the author's, they still give very convincing reasons for their point of view. According to the article, the main two reasons Venus would be beneficial for humans to study would be the amount of information that could be learned about the landscape of Venus millions of years ago, and to satisfy human curiosity while having the satisfaction completing a challenge we have been faced with for centuries.

Though the author gives several convinving reasons for studying Venus, perhaps the most influential would be the amount of information we could gain about the past landscape of Venus. In paragraph four, the author discusses that Venus displays several features similar to Earth, meaning it is possible Venus used be a whole lot like Earth. As stated directly in paragraph four, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth today."" Solely based off the information provided in this quote, the author has already begun to convince me learning more about Venus might actually lead to some pretty extraordinary discoveries. What this quote is saying is millions of years ago Venus may have been the planet with the most liveable conditions...instead of Earth. If scientists were able to discover this much, just imagine all the other life forms and food webs that could be uncovered. To reinforce their opinion on Venus potentislly being liveable in the past, the author states, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can cometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,"" at the end of paragraph four. What the author is saying in this quote is at this point, all we have to do is find out how to brave the conditions of Venus. As for travel time, Venus is practically our neighbor, so no worries there.

A secondary reason the author provides as to why humans should study Venus is to satisfy human curiosity while accomplishing a very large task that has troubled humans for centuries. The author states this idea in paragraph eight when saying, ""...but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" In this quote, the author is saying due to the fact that humans are extremely curious, we will likely find ourselves in a predicament with similar tough challenges in the future, so we may as well begin working through some of them now. When one sets out to complete a task, they should not stop halfway, but follow through until the problem is solved. They also should not quit because they believe the challenge is too hard. If one is able to stick with their guts and do what needs to be done, they will reap the benefits. Whether those benefits be winning a tough volleyball match or finally sending a human to Venus, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that we do not stop believing in ourselves and our ability to accomplish the seemingly impossible.

In conclusion, the author has given many, specifically two, very convincing reasons as to why we should continue to study Venus. The main two reasons are the amount of information we could gain about the past landscape of Venus, and satisfying human curiosity while accomplishing a very large task which has troubled humans for centuries. Based on the authors suggestions on why humans should continue to study Venus, I have considered changing my mind and agreeing that the dangers would be worth it. It is important to have knowledge about the past of our solar system, and it would be very interesting to know if Venus was once able to support various forms of life. I also feel that the author made a good point in stating that we are already this far into studies, so we should not give up now. Humans are always going to be insatiably curious, so by not finding a solution to this problem now, we are just placing this challege upon the generation following us. After all, curiosity technically never killed the cat. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

Although Venus has different surface qualities today, long ago venus was one of the closest Earth like planets, surface wise, that we know of today."" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The author pushes the fact that Earth is comparable to Venus.

Next, the author offers the idea that we should explore Venus because we need to be fearless to grow mankind. He states,""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" He is saying imagine what we could do if we were not afraid of what we could and couldn't do. We must step out from our confinment of our planet to grow and learn.

Lastly, the Author goes on to say that we should take on this challenge because then we will be able to tackle other problems with traveling out into space. ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" He also lists ways Nasa has began working on solutions to study Venus. The author states these reasons in the passage to prove that this challenge has helped Nasa grow and think about new technology that could potentialy help later on.

To conclude, throughout the passage, the author strongly supported his idea on why we should study Venus despite Venus' challenging conditions. Through saying studying venus will help us understand our planet, to helping mankind and to even helping us expand our knowledge in space, he has soldifyed why going to venus is strongly supported.

6A8D0B996598,"The author presents the idea and supports it very well with all of this information that he has provided and mentioned in this exerpt. Getting samples from Venus could be quite beneficial to us humans in furthing our space exploration and devolping more advanced and harder to breach technology and systems. Scientists predicted that Venus may have once been covered in oceans on the surface and been like earth a very long time ago. In paragraph four the author states that,""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to it's surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" If we could get artifacts or samples of soil we could be able to discover out of this world (literally) species that could help us further more understand what Venus used to look like and the type of life that could have been on it. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (or NASA) has been working on new types of systems that could be able to withstand the harsh conditions presented on Venus, by using old space type Mechinical computers. If they could use those they would be way more durable and wouldn't require any electricity at all furthermore extending the time we could stay on Venus. You probably ask why don't we just hover above the planet and just take photos. Well here's the problem, the 97% carbon dixoide atmosphere and most forms of light cannot penerate through the thick atmosphere, rending photos and videos virtually impossible.

CE120A8B4336,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depsite the dangers it presents. The author uses strong details to support this claim throughout the article. Facts and statistics by NASA and other reliable sources are used to back the claims. The author stands by the opinion that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author claims that the idea of inhabiting Venus is worthy due to its similarity to Earth. Paragraph 4 states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). If Venus could've supported human life long ago, it is likely the planet still can. The scientific facts throughout this statement support the author's claim by having a reliable source of information, supporting the idea. Paragraph 4 reads, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Venus already has Earth-like landscapes and other similar formations. This supports the author's idea of exploring Venus because it is so similar to Earth, the chances of survival are higher than any other planet.

Although Venus is analogous to Earth, there are slight differences of the two planets. Earth has average low and high temperatures, while the temperatures of Venus are more extreme. Paragraph 5 reads, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiaton would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). As stated, the conditions would not be easy for humans, but survivable at the least. This supports the author's claim because this proves human life could be achieveable overall. This means there is a worthy reason to explore Venus; to discover another habitable planet. Along with successful life on Venus, our modern technology could also survive the planet. Paragraph 5 states, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground codnitions by staying up and out of their way"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Moreover, if airplanes are already in existence, new aircrafts would need to be slightly adjusted to suit the conditions of Venus. The author's claim is supported in this quote because this is another reason Venus is worth exploring. The technology needed is already almost perfect for the planet, therefore not a problem NASA would have to approach.

Some issues still remain for the exploration, however NASA has already started preparing solutions. The heated state of the planet may be an issue, but NASA is studying a resolution. Paragraph 7 reads, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This new technology created could lead to a long-lasting basis for human life, yet another reason exploring Venus is a brilliant idea. Modern technology is too fragile for the harsh heat of the planet, but with some older computers, that as well could survive on Venus. Paragraph 7 reads, ""The thought of (mechanical) computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This is yet another piece of technology on Earth and prepared for Venus. The author's claim is supported in this statement because it is a simple solution to technology on Venus. There are very few rebuttals that overcome the postive effects of pursuing Venus.

With all the easy fixes, solutions and prep planned for Venus, the author's claim is overwhelmingly supported. The author proved Venus is certainly a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The positive outcomes outweigh the negatives in almost every aspect of this idea. There are multiple reasons presented in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" that prove attempting to explore Venus has a more successful outlook than not. Throughout the article, the facts and claims highly support the author's claim of Venus being a worthy planet to pursue.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8

EC87B7CC98C4,"Venus, often referred to as Earth's ""twin"" is an astouding planet in humanity's solar system.

Venus measures out to nealry the same density and mass of as Earth and is sometimes even the nearest planet to Earth as well.

Humans should find studying Venus as a neccessity to human survival because of the advanced intel that NASA and humans all aorund the world could contain, society on Earth has came up with numerous ways to explore its challenging dangers that Venus envokes, and Venus is worth the exploration because the things soicety can learn and takeaway to help further Earth and the way that Earth functions.

Venus, without a doubt, is a worthy pursuit despite its dangers.

Venus and Earth are extemely similar yet different at the same time.

Many years ago, in paragraph four, Venus was, ""...covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" thus implying the similarities Earth and Venus both share.

Also, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" this being a description of Venus, Earth has all of these qualities as well.

But in contrast, Venus's surface today, ""...temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experince on our own planet."" thus explaining that the temperature and atmosheric pressure is extremly different than what Earth is today.

To make up the these dense hazards that Venus portrays, NASA and many sister companies on Earth have came up with thorough plans to match that dangers Venus depicts.

For example, because of the harsh temperatures on Venus, NASA has envisioned a blimp-like structure that would hover close to 30 miles above Venus, decreasing the temperature about 630 degress and far enough up in orbit to decrease the atmospheric pressure to about equal to a submerged submarine in the ocean.

Thus doing so, NASA could get closer to Venus despite the dangers of extreme temperature and pressure to unveil intel and knowledge about Venus to help expand what we know about Venus.

Another idea that NASA is working on is with the study of electronics made from silicon carbide.

These materials can withstand Venus conditions. To go along with these ideas, other people came up with computer systems from pre and post World War II era.

These computers cn operate and calculate without using technology sensitive materials like today where they got heated easily.

These computers can as well withstand harsh temperatures and pressures that Venus envokes.

Furthermore, through old and new elctronics, and bolstering ideas with different materials NASA and society on Earth can safely study Venus despite the dnagers.

To add, by pursuing Venus society can learn neccessary intel to help further Earth and the way that Earth functions.

For example, by making the trip to Venus, scientists on Earth could study and soon figure out more analogous similarites to Earth and Venus.

They could also help as find out more about how society's world on Earth operates and functions through geology and weather and other things like the the way volcanoes erupt, the earthquakes the Earth has, and the lightining strikes that happen on Earth.

Therefore, with the travel to Venus, society can expand its knowledge on how both Earth and Venus works through the studies that scientists can perform.

In conclusion, by taking the initiative to take on the challenges of Venus, society can gian intel for themselves and for Venus as well as answer unanswered questions that society has had forever.

Thus doing so, society's lapse cannot be stopped by the dangerous challenges it envokes but be stopped by society's dense imagination. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
C7A3BCE1383F,"Venus, one of the closest planets to Earth, is occassionally called the ""Evening Star"". Humans have tried to explore Venus for many decades, but failed because of the dangers it presents. Researchers are trying to find better solutions to overcome these dangers.

FAB2E7DB60B1,"Is studying Venus worth the dangers it presents to people? This topic is often debated, many want to but cannot seem to overcome the atmoshperic conditions. The author of this article thinks it is worth exploring. The modern electronics wouldn't survive,it's tempurature is 800 degrees and NASA's sulotion has even greater diffficulties.

The third paragraph in this article the author discusses the planets atmopshere and temperature. The atmosohere surronding Venus is 97 percent carbone dioxide,a gas deadly to humans. The clouds around Venus are very corrosive sulfuric acid, and the pressure is 90 times greater then on earth. The temperature at the surface is 800 degrees. These climates are far more extreme than any climate on eath. The author does not give a very good reason the danger are worth it in this peregraph. These dangers could very easily end a life of any person willing ot explor Venus.

In paragraph four the author discusses how NASA wants to send people to study venus. They do not currently have any invintions that would allow humans to be on the sufrace of Venus. They are purposing a vehicle similar to a blimp that would travel 30 miles above the surface of Venus. The heat would still be a 170 degrees, but the pressure would be survivable. However in paragraph six the author continues to shut down ideas, that would prove their point. They talk about how the atmosphere is so dense that light would not be able to penetrate it. Then continues to talk about how they couldnt gather rock,gas or any other samples. They also state that standered photography and videagraphy would be useless.

In paraghrap seven the author goes over the aproaches of tecnology. They say NASA is working on some electronics made of siclicon carbide,though they are simplified they lasted three weeks in a simulatution of Venuses atmosphere. They are also working on old technology. The devices were first thougt of in the 1800s and played a big part during world war two. The devices used levers and gears to make calculations. They do not work as quickly as modern computers but are less sensetive to extreme conditions.

Scientifics are curious even more ""Many researchers are working on innovatios that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"".(Paragraph 6).Venus is an important planet and is close to our solar system this makes scientifics more curious.

The author explains the danger they can put themselves into but they want to examine all closely. Venus has palces where people can live too and the Sun is close to them, this is what makes it more important.

The author also talks about the risks but they want to visit and explore more about this ""Evening Star"".

39BA457D842C,"Venus may have some dangers. The author think's venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Here are some things you should know about Venus. Venus may be called "" Evening Star "". The Evening star is one of the brightest point of light in the sky. Even though Venus is called a Star it's actually a planet. Venus is the secound planet from the sun.

It being close to the sun makes it hard to examine closely.

Venus may be very challenging to get around or to beable to find more out about. Venus is the closest to the earth. Venus is like a cloud-draped world. One of the dangers of Venus is it being cloud-draped because humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus. No spacecraft lasted the landing more than a few hour if that.

A reason Venus is a dangerous place is the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide. Venus has challenging clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we feel on our own planet. How we know this informaiton can help understand that the author thinks venus has some dangers on it. For example , "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth ; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. ""

Venus would be a worthy pursuit depite the dangers because Venus was once the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. Venus used to be covered with largely oceans and may have supported various forms of life. To this day Venus has some features that are analogous to those on earth. Venus surface is a rocky sediment. Venus also has some familiar features such as valleys , moutains and craters.

This concludes how the author think's that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Venus may be harmful to humans but at one point Venus was just like our home. Venus once has forms of life like we do today on planet earth. Venus might be something interesting but the danger's is what keep's us from landing. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
4DCE9956E3DE,"The author states that going to Venus would be worth it despite the risks, but does not back up this claim very well. They mostly talk about the dangers of going to Venus instead of focusing on the importance of exploring there. They also say things like ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere,"" and ""the atmospheric pressure is over 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet,"" basically emphasizing that Venus would be almost impossible to explore because of the extreme harsh conditions on the planet.

First off, in paragraph 3 the author writes ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This is the author suming up how impossible it would be to travel there with the technology scientists have today. They even state ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans."" By saying this they are even supporting the fact that scientists can't get there with the technology they have now.

Secondly, the only support the author has for even traveling to Venus in the first place, is that it is closely related to the planet Earth having features like valleys and mountains. In paragraph 4 he writes ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" So basically the only reason we should spend the billions of dollars it would take to travel there, is because it is somewhat similar to our planet. The only other support the author has for traveling there is the point that it is the closest planet for planetary visit. Although this might be true, this doesn't rule out the fact how inhospitable and dangerous the planet is.

Furthermore, the rest of the article including paragraphs 5 and 7, the author talks about ways we can get there with the technology we have now. They state that ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" So the scientists wouldn't actually land on Venus and explore, they would just stay 30 miles or so above the surface and look down onto it. But then in paragraph 6 they completley contradict themselves by writing ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions, because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmospher, rendering standard froms of photography and videography ineffective."" By saying this, they suggest that if the scientists were able to hover above Venus and look down, they would have to have some special camera in order to see anything through Venus's thick atmosphere.

Finally, the author doesn't have very much support for his claim: exploring Venus is worth it despite the dangers. They mostly talk about all the dangers of the planet and why scientists can't get there, saying things like ""Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere,"" and ""the atmospheric pressure is over 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet.""

These challenges are the main thing holding us back from exploring further. The author believes that our travels beyond Earth should'nt be limited by dangers and doubts.

The article also talkes about how we need longer lasting technology for further research. It mentions mechanical computers and how they don't require electronics at all. The author suggests using the mechanical parts, like the ones used in the mechanical computers, and using them to create technology that will last longer on Venus. This would allow for more research. More research means better understanding of Venus which will allow for better technology to with stand the conditions.

98A98B46BC80,"What happens if earth ever becomes inhabitable? Well, often reffered to as ""earths twin"" Venus, might just come in handy. But there's a small problem. We only know a small amount about Venus from the numerous amounts of spacecraft we have sent there. Sadly they could not get much information before

Venus's heat runined them. No spacecaft has survived the landing for more than a few hours. So, what are the risks we need to take to find out more about Venus? Well the author of ""The Challege of Exploring Venus"" answers exactly that.

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" states that Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide along with the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The planets surface tempatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than earths. As you can see it is extremly diffiuclt to find out more about this planet without potentionaly getting hurt or sending a drone up there to get deystroyed.

NASA may have came up with a soulution though. The surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. It would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. It would still be hot but about 630 degrees cooler. The air pressure would be close to earths sea levels. But will all of this allow scientists to find out what they need to about ""earths twin""?

Even with scientists being safe above the fray scientists still can't take picture or pick up samples of rocks, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Scientists are still trying to figure out a way that would allow them to do so. Researchers are working on innovations that would allow NASA's machines to last long enough to where they can find out what they need. They have some ideas for exaple, they are looking at simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and old technology used back in world war two. But they will do whatever they can to learn more about this amazing planet to see if its of any use to us.

Sometimes risks should be taken if the outcome could be greater. In this case it is. If scientists can learn more about this planet then they can find out if we can use it in the future. Everyone is willing to take this risks if it means we can potentionally find a new home in case we ever need it. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
