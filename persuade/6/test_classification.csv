You can tell the author belives this to be ok evon though its dangerous when he said,"" Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intemidating eneavors."" This means that he knows its dangruse but everyone is curuose about what they will find, even if its dangerous he thinks its worth it. The opertunity to find signs of life or rare metals it would prove tempting for some even if it was dangrouse.

If you continue to read the passage he goes on to talk about how Venus is inhospitable. He then says he still wants to study it by saying, ""Astronomers are facinated by Venus beause it may well once have been the most earth like."" This means they are trying to see if Venus had life just as earth dose now.

In conclusion the author thinks the pros of going to Venus out way the cons. Honestly I think he is right my self we could discover so much if only we knew what secrets Venus holds.    ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
82B0477EF671,"The author is answering rather or not if humans going to Venus is worth the dangers it presents. The author thinks that yes, we should go to Venus because it will meet the very edges of are imaginations, curiosity, and we are making machines that will last longer on Venus.

The first reason the author gave us on why we should land on Venus is that it will meet the very edges of are imaginations. What the other means by this is thed human body is always thinking about what is out there in space. By putting humans on Venus this can give us an answer to are imangination and maybe make us think even more about what is out there.

Not only does the author say it will meet the very edges of are imaginations he also says ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by it will meet the very edges of are imaginationsenus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity. What the author means by this is he is showing that we are never not wondering. We will always be wanting to do something that will answer a question that we have. For example, ""i wonder what this book is about"". what you would do is read the book. Just like how we wonder what Venus is like. We want to land on it.

The last reason the author gave to us is that NASA is making more machines to be able to handle the weather on Venus. In the text it says ""Many researchers are work on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". By the author saying this hes menaing that sinse we have more machines that can make it to Venus we can now learn more about to be able to send humans to that planet.

So by the author giving us all these reasonf he thinks that yes, we should go to Venus because it will meet the very edges of are imaginations, curiosity, and we are making machines that will last longer on Venus.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
B7929D12F8C6,"The challange of exploring venus. Exploring venus would be hard but not easy because of there weather conditions. Venus does have alot of things on there plant that Earth has also. Venus is sometimes the Evening Star due to the fact that it is the brightest light in the sky also making it simple for amateur stargazer to spot. Now scientist say that it may be possible to live on Venus some day but they are having a hard time trying to study Venus because of a thick atomosphere that almost has 97 percent carbon dioxide.

Venus is one of the closest planets to Earth in terms of density and size. One of the National Aeronautics an Space Administration are trying to send humans to study Venus. They are trying figure out a solution where the humans they send can be in a floating vehicle or some kind of way they can study Venus without Being on the plant. If they were to be on the plant they would be burning up because of how hot Venus is the degrees are around 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

Nasa will be looking to figure new ways on how to study Venus. They are working on making a some kind of object to go on Venus to see what information they can get. WHo knows Nasa someday in the future will figyre out more about Venus.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
B588CBAC21D2,"Venus, the Evening Star is a gorgeous planet to look at in the night sky but is a deadly planet to step foot on. Scientists and astronomers are finding various ways to either put a human on the planet or send another spacecraft over to sit in the air longer than a couple of hours like the past ones that were sent.

First venus has a lot of flaws and conditions where humans wouldn't be able to outstand. In the text it states, ""On the planet's surface, tempatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit..."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus) No human would be able to outstand that burning tempature without some type of aircraft or special suit. Also in the text it states, "" and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus) You would just crush if you were placed on this planet. These condition are way more extreme than anything us humans have encountered.

Second, even though scientists and astronomers know how dangerous venus is and how terrible their conditions are, they are fascinated and want to learn way more about it. They believe venus is the most Earth like planet in our solar system. In the text it states. ""Long ago, Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus) If so, this would be a good reason to explore and find out more things that used to be on this planet. The text also states, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus) After reading all of this, it can show that Venus can be our only closest option for a planetary visit in the furutre.

In conclusion, there are a lot of pros and cons in sending a human or spacecraft to the planet Venus. The planet Venus is deadly and if someone steps on the planet without the proper grear or spacecraft, it will lead to a tragic but obvious death. But soon, curiosity will lead us humans to the planet to evaluate and study the planet Venus. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
900BEEB28B8F,"Most of the people on Earths examinated that visiting a different planet such as Venus is endanger places to explore but the author from ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" denied what others thought was wrong. The author suggest that visiting is one of the greatest planet to visite, need to investigated, and how it impact the people who live on Earth and expecially the planet Earth it self. Venus is oftenly ""reffered to as Earth's twin"".

The author included that Venus is one of the greatest place to visited. The text says,""Venus is the closets planets to Earth.."" This texts show that it's not far from Earth, and making people should take their chance to visited. The other texts support that it's would be the greatest opportunity for the people who would be willing to put his life at risk for good and worst,""a crucial consideration gioven the long time frames of a space travel"". ""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable but what are the options for making suh a mission both safe and scientically productive?"". This both evidence from the texts exaplain that throught the worst part it would make things better.

More people such as young adult, who studies about the Earths' revolution or who is a scientist, Venus is a great place to study about the enviromental as such, weather;climate, the population and the atmosphere. The author is making a comparison about Venus and Earth, how they alike. They could make a comparison about Earth and Venus; how they are alike and are different. ""the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" ""and the atmospherc pressure is 90 times greater than what we experince on our own planet."" This texts support the evidence about the comparison about Earth and Venus how are they different. ""such as enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" This means that in our planet; Earth how it is difficult for people to survived due to such as hurricane and tornado.

Venus would be the greatest helper for Earth it self in many goods. The contact is the insight of the condition it form lights and how it would impact magnificent the solar system that produced from Venus are because Venus is ""the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.."" The author also described it as ""powerful earthquakes"" that form ""lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."" This evidence means that Venus has a strong power that would form the bigger lighting than Earth and it would be the great helper for the humans to uses to make our solar system a better one.

Venus is oftenly ""reffered to as Earth's twin"" . Many people on Earth should take a chance to visit Venus and learn about the magnifcent circumstand between both planet, Eath and Venus. The main reason is Venus one the greatest helper an impact the people who lives on Earth many way. One of them the people would learn many entity on Venus by exploring and investigate how things work. People could also make assuption or making comparison about Venus and Earth and they would learned to make the Earth a better place to live and give a credict to the Venus for helping the people live in Earth.

2854C527F31D,"NASA has been wanting to explore our sister planet, but doesn't know how to make a vehicle capable of surviving Venus's atmoshperic differences from Earth. The author explains his claim of how it's a worthy pursuit that needs time and focus to happen. They strengthen their claim by describing the climate and dangers, differences in technology made to suvive it's conditions, and alternatives to exploring Venus.

The author of the passage first describes Venus. They describe how it's different from Earth and how that provides a challenge to NASA. The author brings in the atmospheric differences (such as what it's made of and the pressure), temperatures, geological, and weather differences. NASA has to take all of these into mind and adapt to it so they can explore the planet safely.

Since Venus is so different from Earth, NASA has to make vehicles that'll withstand the atmosphere and pressure of it. The author describes how they've come up with a blimp-like vehicle to explaore Venus safely for up to three weeks. The author explains how that could be a problem as well, seeing as how the blimp couldn't reach the ground to collect anything for NASA to study when they get back.

The author understands that NASA is working on alternatives to get closer to the surface of Venus so they can study it more. The author tells us how they've come up with different technological methods to get closer to the surface without damaging a vehicle or expensive equipment. They bring up a piece of electronic equipment made of silicon carbide that lasted for up to three weeks in the conditions of Venus. That detail gives us insight on how close NASA is to safel exploring the suface of the sister planet.

Exploring the surface of Venus has become a big focus for NASA. The author wants to give us insight of how challenging and dangerous it is, but also how they're working on making it possible with different pieces of equipment that's stable eough for the atmosphere of Venus. They do that by describing the climate and dangers of Venus, the differences needed to be made in technology to survive the conditions, and the alternatives that can be used to explore the surface of Venus safely.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
F2739E865E43,"The author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by explaining how fascinating Venus truly is and how there are ways of getting around the hazards involved. The author goes into detail about how Venus is so fascinating because it is our Earth's ""twin"". Although there are numerous safety hazards for the space travelers, NASA has developed many theories on how to get around it. With this he is able to support his view that studying Venus up close would be benefitial despite the dangers at hand.

Venus is one of the closest planets to resemble Earth in the entire solar system. The author states, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size..."" This is the author's way of introducing the idea that other planets in our solar system could have been able to harbor some form of life at some point. The author also states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" The author uses these excerpts in order to explain to the reader why there is such a fascination with studying Venus and why he supports it.

Venus has its fair share of deadly hazards including erupting volcanos, atomic pressure beyond what any human can stand, intense heat and many more serious hazards. The author states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray...a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way...Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author includes this to show that although Venus has it's dangers there are ways to get around them, he does this in order to support ,or convince the reader, that studying Venus would be more important than the possible dangers.

In conclusion, the author supported his belief that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers excellently. The author explains that Venus could have once been exactly like Earth and even now Venus is the closest to resembling Earth. He explained that there are indeed many safety hazards but with NASA working on ways around these hazards, the trip would be worth it, even if it's just from a bird's-eye view.

877F6174E222,"The author uses connotations by suggesting that venus is a worthy pursuit is studying but the dangers that it has is that it's the hottest planet in the solar system and went through the greenhouse effect while is was being created. Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets around it. The temperatures on average is around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has more powerful earthquakes,erupting volcanoes and frequent lightning strikes.

It says that NASA is working on approaches for getting to venus. Like for example,simplified electronics made of silicon carbide has been tested through a chamber. A vehicle hovering over venus would avoid the ground but the surface would still be hot at around 170 degrees fahrenheit. Venus can sometimes be a good planetary visit. The planet has rocky sediments on its surface such as valleys,mountains and craters.

A phone or a tablet being exposed to acid could be heat capable to melting just imagine what that would be like. By comparing it with a system that uses mechanical parts the system can be made to be more resistant from pressure and heat resources. Many researchers cannot take gas or rock from a distance.

5E57B80BFC66,"In the aricle ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" says that Venus is really good to study despite the dangers you might encounter. The article says that you may study it,imagen all the wonders you can find.

Also in paragrpah two it says that Venus and Earth are ""twin"". They say that planet Venus has the closest planet to Earth, but the density and size are some what close. It also say's that the speed of orbiting around the sun is close to Mars, and also Venus. Yet also Venus is very close to us that the humans have tried to send spacecraft to land on Venus numerous times. And yet each time was a fail since it only survived for a few hours.

Also in paragraph three it says that the atmosphere is very thick in Venus. That it has a 97 percent of carbon dioxide that covers Venus. Also the temperature is very extreme which is why we cannot live in Venus, even though Mercury is closest to the sun Venus is much hotter than Mercury.

Another reason is that Venus has a high pressure and also heat which states in paragraph three. Venusian geology says that Venus has erupting volcanoes, and very powerful erathquakes, it also has frequent lightning strikes that hits on the land.

Also in paragraph four it says Venus was probably coverd in largely oceans which can also supported the various forms of life. Yet also Venus does have some features of Earth, Venus has rocky sediment which includes valleys,mountains,and also craters. Also scientist say that to visit Venus it will take a long time frames of space travel, and also if you want to return form Venus it will be very hard.

Another reason on why Venus can be dangerous to study is that humans are having an idea on sending humans to Venus. Scientist are coming up with a solution have them float above the fray and not land. They are coming up with ideas of having a blimp like vehicle just hovering about 30 or more miles above the landscape. They may have a vehicle hovering over Venus so it could avoid the ground conditions for just staying off ground. The surface on Venus is around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure is close to the sea level on Earth which says on paragraph five.

In conclusion Venus is very dangerous, it has high temperatures and high pressure which the humans can not survive. Earth and Venus may have the same mountains and valleys, but Venus is to hot for us to survive. In conclusion Venus is dangerous to study.   ",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent

It's been 30 years since any Earth-based object has on Venus and we got to go back again. Despite the dangers of going to this planet, we should send spaceships and astronauts to Venus because it is highly possibale that there is plenty of oceans and can support life forms from Earth.

Sending astronauts and spacecrafts to Venus is good idea because it's possible that there is oceans and other relations to Earth.

Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"". Mountain Ranges, oceans, oxygen, and other landforms on Venus are close relations to Earth.

552A6E7456E8,"Nothing like chilling in an 800 degree oven and having pressure thats 90 times greater than that on earth while studying a planet. Thats what it would be like to study Venus on its surface. But scientists want to some how find a way to study it, Safely. There are three big things that the author writes about in this article that may be a safe alternative or possobility to study Venus like floating above the atmosphere of venus, using simplified electronics made of silicon carbide, or using something called mechanical computers.

First things first the author talks about hovering above Venus's atmosphere to avoid all of the most of the dangers. High heat, crazy high pressure levels, Ect. The author of the article says, "" Just as our Jet airplances travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid all the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" This is a safe alternative to landing on the surface because it takes away the problems that they have been having all together. But the problem he has with this is that the only things they can do to study it is observe they can't take samples of rock, gasses, or anything else. But it will get them a basic view of the planet nothing much more.

Another thing that the author stated may work is using simplified electronics made of silicon carbide. This will help because because of the type of material. The author states within the article, "" Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks."" This is why it could help because it lasted three weeks where regular things couldn't even last 3 hours on venus without getting comepletly abliterated. So if they where made out of the silicon carbide they would be able to get it on Venus get samples of gasses, rock, and anything else they could find then get out of there before it gets destroyed hopefully.

The last thing that the author talked about that could work is using old technology called mechanical computers. The devises where envisioned in the 1800 and helped out in world war II. But the author says, "" The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all."" This would help because of the fact they could get it on Venus and not have to worry about the electrical boards of the vehicle frying. Because there will be no Electric envoleved in the process. If they made it out of a heavy duty metal or maybe even silicon carbide it may allow it to work on Venus and get samples of gasses, rock, and anything else on the surface of venus.

The three big things that may allow the exploration of Venus to be a possability are floating above the atmosphere of venus, using simplified electronics made of silicon carbide, or using something called mechanical computers. These ideas could help visually see the planet close up, Get on the planet safely, and move around the planet and get samples of evidence. This would help out NASA in the great race of space with all the things that they could discover from the planet of Venus. So while we are sitting here on earth one day there may be a man in a comepletly different situation of being in extreme heat and pressure.

9BB4DF66A9C8,"The author does not support his idea well that studiying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author talks about people being facinated with Venus, that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in proximity and features, and that it would be cool if humans were able to explore Venus. What he does not talk about well is the why. Why Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

Here is a part of the artical where the author talks about why it would be cool to study Venus. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,""(paragraph 4). The author mentions humans being facinated with Venus and how the planet was once Earth-like. This information does help us see how it would be cool to visit Venus and it tells us some information about Venus. On the other hand the author doesn't give a solid reason for why studying Venus is worth it and despite the risks. ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors,""(paragraph 8). The author does not tell us what the insight is that will be gained from exploring the planet. Also what does human curiosity leading us into other endeavors have to do with how studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Their reason and support for studying Venus is weak. The author trys to use their own opinion to convince the readers that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. The author aslo doesn't give a sound explanation as to how the danger of heat can be overcome for enabling the trip to be successful. ""Some simplified eclectronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions,""(paragraph 7). The author explains that there is a material that can survive on Venus for a little while. A problem to this could be that the metal might actually not work on Venus because since no one has ever been ther how would they know exactly what it is going to be like. That is why they are going there in the first place to explore Venus. They could have totally messed up on the calculations of surviving on the planet and it might be a failure. The pros of this mission are far less important than the cons to this mission. If they succed then they can say they know what on Venus and can gain some information. If they fail then people can die, a load of money is gone because of the time, energy, and resorces put into the exploration are gone.

The author does not support his idea well that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They only give a few reasons why the trip would be worthy. They use their own opinions as facts trying to pursuade the readers to agree with their ideas. They also don't fully explain how they can by pass the dangers involved with this exploration study on Venus.

32A121824D02,"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because the planet itself is dangerous. Venus is the same as the Earth, I mean it is reffered to as Earth's ""twin"", but there both the same only because of the density and size. Both planets do have the same shape and density, but planet Earth is much more safer than Venus.

Venus has a thick atmoshpere, so it makes it harder to breathe. For example, in the text it says,"" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" It's impossible for somoene to even live on Venus because of it's own atmosphere.

Exploring and studying the planet Venus is actually challenging when you think about it. People tried to study about the planet, people have tried to explore, but in the end, it ends up failing. For example, in the text it states, "" since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" This is explaining how bad the planet really is.

No spacecraft can even touch the ground on planet Venus. The reason why no spacecraft has touched down on planet Venus is because of the clouds itself. For example, in the text it explains,"" the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmoshpheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Venus has a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit, while Earth's highest temperature is at least 110 to 120 degrees. So planet Venus is very hot, that probably explains why no spacecraft can land on the planet because it's so hot in the planet that the clouds trap all that heat inside.

Venus is a dangerous place cause of the atmosphere, environment, and study of the planet.

There are many good reasons why NASA doesn't go to Venus. One is the atmosphere, Venus's atmosphere is ""almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide"" that goes complely around the planet. The most challening part is in Venus's atmosphere once you past the carbon dioxide is the ""highly corrosive sulfuric acid.""

Hot days are the best right, well on Venus the average temperatures are ""over 800 degress Fahreneit."" ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.""

634A2AD49A62,"Venus is one of the two closest planets to earth. Scientists would very much like to travel to Venus and even poissibly take samples from there, but there are a lot of dangers. Despite all the dangers Venus is still very much like Earth, and even though Venus would be very challenging to travel to it is still very much possible.

Venus was most likely the planet to be very much like Earth a very long time ago, but even today Venus has some features that are the same as Earth's. For example, in paragraph 4, the text states,""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment an includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Venus may not completely be like Earth, but it has vey similar features. Scientist already know about some of these features, but there are probably a lot more similarities between the two planets.

Traveling to Venus would be very challenging and even possibly life risking, but scientists are sure there is a way. NASA's idea is to hover over the fray with a blimp like vehicle, but there are still risks. In paragraph 5, the author says,"" At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" The temperature in the blimp like vehicle would still be very uncomfortable for the passenegers, but the last sentence in paragraph 5 says, "" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans""

Traveling to Venus would be an amazing thing for the people in NASA. There are many different risks, but so much would come ouf of traveling there. Having risks should not stop scientist from being able to experiment with different planets, especially one so close to home.

Us humans have landed on the Moon and sent and leanded rovers on Mars why not try and land a rover on Venus. The author does a good job of supporting his/her claim that we should go to and study Venus more, by talking about how it may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, sending blimp-like vehicles to hover above the surface, and testing that NASA has done.

Venus may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In the article the author states ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" the author says in paragraph 4 is ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" the authors means that since Venus has all of these terrains that are similar to Earth that it may have had liquid water on the surface and the right temperatures to support life.

In the next paragrphs the author talks about imagining sending a blimp-like vehicle to venus to hover around 30 miles above the surface like how our jet planes fly at a higher altitude to avoid flying in storms. towards the end of paragraph 5 it states that the ""temperautres would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" This shows that if we use the right materials we could fly the blimp-like aircraft and study how the air pressure is and the exact degrees the atmosphere would be.

Lastly, the author explains on how the testing that NASA has done. In the text the author says ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus... some simplified electronicsmade of silicon carbide have been tested.. simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" this shows that the author is getting information from a reliable source (NASA). The author also dives deeper and talks about how another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers and that they can resist physical conditions better than modern computers.

In conlusion, the author did a great job saying that Venus is worthy of studying even though the dangers that it presents to us.

he/her supported their idea well with reasons like, how Venus may well once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system saying that earlier in Venus's lifetime that it was probably covered in water and supported various lifeforms. Another reason was to imagine sending a blimp-like spacecraft to hover 30 miles above the surface o Venus, and , Lastly the test that NASA has been doing to spacecrafts to withstand Venus's surface for at least three weeks.

FD998A2E69A5,"Venus is a very unique and unknown planet to us on Earth. Studying Venus would get us insight on what truly the planet of Venus is. Venus gives us many dangerous and hostile conditions, but our knowledge and cluelessness gives us even more curiousity on what the big unknown is. Our knowledge shouldn't be limited to what is possibe but should be limited to what is impossible.

Venus is one of the brightest points in the night sky. Venus is known as the "" Earth's twin"" while being the closest planet to Earth in density and size. ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encouter on Earth,"" stated from the passage. Given this information we can conclude that Venus has some unreal features and are unlike what anyone has ever seen. This planet has so much uniqueness about it and should be evaluted to the most possible limits. It holds many unknown factors of what Venus really is.

Studying Venus could bring so much more insight of the planet itself. The passage states,""Venus stil has some features that are analogous to those on Earth,"" this means that Venus has some features that are like the features that are present on Earth. Paragraph four states,"" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in out solar system,"" this tells us that Venus could of once been Earth-like, but what made it change? Studying Venus could give us significant information on what Venus once was or maybe even what the Earth will turn into.

Studying Venus could be one of the most complicated and dangerous things ever done. In paragraph five it states,"" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float about the fray."" This possible solution could help scientists observe and evaluate Venus's surface, but would have to avoid unfriendly gound conditions. ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans,"" was stated in paragraph six, it signifies that it is possible to observe Venus, but may not be the easiest mission. Despite risks of the mission,"" many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus. No matter the risks or how dangerous Venus is, studying Venus would be one worthy pursuit and one of the most innovative and significant observations in history.

As paragraph eight states,"" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Studying Venus would be one of the most worthy pursuits despite the dangers it presents, because it would give us information that could change the way we live today. The planet Venus gives us such curiosity that we meet the very edges of our imagination and innovation. Reading this passage, the author gave us ideas on wondering what happened to Venus, was Venus once Earth-like, and if whether or not the impossible is possible when observing Venus.

""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the debate of the exploration of Venus is exposed for discussion. The article brings up many contriversal topics discussing whether or not Venus is worth exploring. Though most of the article talks about the dangers and overall negativities Venus has to offer when it comes of exploring it, the author takes this information and turns it into postives. The author demonstrates that although Venus is dangerous and almost impossible to explore, attempting to do just that willl be well worth it in the long run. Due to this, the readers can say that the author supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers very well.

In the article, the author first brings up the fact that Venus has a very toxic and dangerous atmosphere. They go on to say that because of this, the conditions in Venus are far to extreme for any human to survive in. Then, the author even posses the question of: Why are scientists trying to explore Venus more if it's so inhospitable? The author uses this question to transition into how they support the exploration of Venus, by saying how despite the inhospitable environment, Venus has many Earth-like qualities which intrigues many astronomers. In the article the author states, ""... Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This shows that learning more about Venus could potentially be a great advantage to Earth since it's the most similar planet to Earth in the entire solar system.

A second problem the author states about exploring Venus is that every attempt to explore the planet has failed. One reason being is how the extreme heat has prevented each spacecraft to survive for more than a couple of hours on Venus's surface. In the article the author states, ""... no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" The author contradicts this later in the article by explaining the technological advacements that NASA has accomplished to help prevent having another failed mission to Venus. The author states, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This demonstrates how even though Venus is about impossible to explore, technology can help create smarter alternatives for exploring the planet's surface.

Throughout the article, the author demonstrates that the postives of exploring Venus outweigh the negatives by giving strong evidence as to why the positives eliminate the problems when it comes to exploring Venus's surface. Although there are many major issues with exploring Venus, the author shows the readers that there are solutions that can help fix these problems. Not only does the author do this, but they show how Earth can discover and learn many valuable things about Venus that can help in the long run. So through very strong evidence about the positve that was able to outweigh the negative, the author was able to support the idea of studying Venus very well.  ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent

In The Challenge of Exploring Venus the author says there are valleys, mountains, and craters. I think it would be nice if they could think of a way to explore venus but i dont know if that will happen because we might not be advanced enough. If we where able to get on the planet with out dieing we might find out that there was life on it or there might still be life on there that had to adapt to the envierment.

83C6DD1C409A,"The author supports the idea well that Venus is a worthy planet to study. The way that people can study venus is to stay above the surface in a blimp, they could build space crafts and rovers out of the strongest material on Earth, and they could also make a submarine like vehicle that is strong enough to with stand the heat and the preasure.

The fact that Venus is a planet that is close to us should make it easy to go to. It is not easy because of the preasure and the heat. A way to get around these issues is to make a blimp that will stay above the surface of the world so then it only gets part of the preasure and heat. Then they can try to get evidence and samples from the surface of the planet to bring back with them to study on earth.

They could get the strongest material on Earth and use it to make space crafts and rovers that will with stand the full heat and preasure. Then the rover could collect samples of gases and rocks. It could also get photographs and videos of what the surface looks like. It could then take everything back to Earth and then humans could study the diffrent samples it collected.

They could make a submarine like vehicle that can withstand the preasure. If they do that then they can collect the samples and figure out if Venus had life on it before. They could find out if Venus could become a new home for humans if it is needed. Then the submarine could send all of the evidence back and then we can study all the evidence we need to study to learn more about Venus.

In Counclusion, they need to make a vehicle out of the strongest material to send down to the suface of Venus and try to collect samples. Then the vechile will come back to Earth with the diffrent materials and then humans would get to work on studying the samples.             ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent

In paragraph 2 it says that Venus is considered Earth's ""twin"". They say that because they are simlar in shape and size. The one of the differences they have is speed. In paragraph 2 it also states that, ""because Venus is sometimes right around the corner - in space terms - humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud-draped world.""

9B173EBFB406,"The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despit the dangers it persents, because he or she feels very strongly that there is more to Venus then we think. Many people think that Venus is a star because of the nickname it was given ""Evening Star,"" but it is really a planet. Venus is the second planet from the sun. From a distance we are safe but is has been one of the most challenging planets to examine closly.

The author thinks that Venus is worth learning more about because it is the most earth like panet in the solar system. It has shown signs of various forms of life, oceans, valleys, mountains, and craters. With these shocking findings many scientists will be wanting ti find out more avout the dangrous planet. Venus is an extreamly hard planet to acess safely. The atmosphere is made up of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and it coveres the entire planet of venus. The more challenging part of landin gon Venus id the cloud that are made up of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. when you get to the actual part of the planet the temperatures avrage of about 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the pressure of the atnosphere is 90 tmes greater then on earth. To get there safely the only way would to hover about 30 miles over the planet.

Although studying Venus is a dangrous activity there are other soultions to getting there safely. Many scientists are working on finding a way to make the machines last long enough fo us to gather information and samples. Finding a soultion that will work for in the harsh ennviroment that Venus brings is going to be very diffcult. The scientists are going to have to extra hard to get something that can stand the conditons. The idea of studying such a dangerous planet can be a little unsettling, you have to know all the things that could go wrong and how to prevent them and you also have to be prepared for everything. The author thinks that studying venus is a good idea even though is is dangerous because he or she knows that there is more to it then we can see.

Studying Venus will do good for the people working at NASA and all the other who study our solar system because it will bing in more information about things that have happend and why some things happen on earth today.

This would mean that you couldn't really experiment anything you find there and it would be pointless to even go to Venus. To be able to study Venus like they want they would need evidence and samples of different objects from there. The article also states ""Peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions becuase most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standards forms of photography and videography ineffective."" This would mean that you would need to stay so far away and even when being that far the pictures or videos you would want to take could not be done. Also with additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface makes the chances more slim to surving on Venus for even a few short hours.

In conclusion, I would not say studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Venus is the second planet from our sun which is why it's proved to be a very challenging place to examine more closely.

I will be discussing the following, simplified electronics and mechanical computers to support the author's claim.

The author states that, ""NASA is working on different approaches to studying Venus."" One of these approaches are the simplified electronics that were tested in a chamber that is supposed to simulate Venus' chaotic surface, and lasted for three weeks. Another approach is mechanical computers which, ""were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II."" This device does not require electronics and they ""make calculations by using gears and levers."" Any regular, modern computer if exposed to acid or heat are capable of melting, as well as cell phones and tablets. This shows that devices that use mechanical parts can tend to be more resistant to such pressure, heat, and other forces.

I have concluded that though it is risky and dangerous to study Venus, I think it's worth knowing about it and it's contents. It's a great challenge for us humans but that is what makes it worth knowing about. What if Venus excedes our expectations and we find something that could possibly be life impacting?

Even though there is a planet between the sun and venus the sun is making venus more hotter because it is about the same size as the the sun. Venus being the hotest planet is can reach up to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Nothing has been on Venus in three decades because it it so hot that everytime they send something to land on Venus it turns to a liquid.

Venus has almsot the same features as planet earth. Planet earth is covered in oceans, and could have supported various forms of life. Venus Could have oceans, and could support various forms of life just like earth. Venus has some features that are analogues to those on earth. Today Venus has a surfacw of rocky, sediment and includes familiar featrues such as valleys, mountains and craters. Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary. The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the potions for making such a mission both safe and scienfically productive is because the NASA has one compelling idea to make blip like cahicle hoverign over 30 miles or so above the roiling Venusian landscape so they can get an idea of what the landscaping looks like.

NASA is on a misson to stat a project to get all the stuff they can to make somethign so that theu are able to get it to land on Venus sincce nothing has landed on Venus in three decades. If NASA

uses the blimp like vehicle to make it to Venus they will be able to see what Venus looks like and what they need to use and how to use some of the material to make the project / mission able to fly to Venus without VEnus making it luiqify to a liquid. NASA has been working on this mission for a long time and are hoping to find a thing to make to fly to Venus and land it up ther for the first time ina long time about three decades ago is when something was last landed on Venus

In this essay I explained to you why Venus os a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. There might be a lot of dangers with Venus but by reading the prompt NASA would do anything to get somethign to land on Venus. It would be cool to have something land on Venus for the first time in forever. This essay is why Venus is worth the pursuit because of all the characteristics and features and how hot it gets.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent

I still think that trying to learn about differient plants is not right becuses us as people doint even know adout are oun plant. I still think that we have a lots of time till earth becomes like Veunus.

In the text the author is trying to tail us that "" Venus is the closest planet to Earth is terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in destance too.

""Humans have sent many spaceships to Venus but no spacecraft had survived the land for more than a few hours"", said the author. The only reason that we can not stay on the planet is because, one there is a thick atmosphere of alomst 97 percent carbon dioxid. Two becuase in order to get on to the planet you would have to go through clouds and clouds on Venus are not like clouds on Earth. But on Venus they are highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Three on the planets surface the tempertures reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Four the atmostpheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we have on Earth. And these conditions are far more extreme than ANYTHING on Earth. With that kind of atmostpheric pressure it woukd crush a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest part of the ocean, and it would liquefy many metals.

Going to the venus can be a bad thing, but the scientists will have more opportunities to learn about the similerities and the differences between the Earth and Venus. The author provides information about the distence from earth to venus. The author provided, ""Often referred to as Earths twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too"" (paragraph 2). This evidence explains that it can also be very easy for the scientists to travel there than to travel to the other planets because it is very close to Earth and that's why people call it the ""twin"" of earth.

It is stated, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (paragraph 4).

Now here is the solution for scientists to go to Venus. It will be a lot easier now and more fun for scientists to visit another planet just like Earth. Also to learn more about it.

Venus could be hard planet to visit, but NASA has provided a solution which could help scientists to visit the similar planet. Not only it is fun to visit, but it can help people learn about why Venus is similar to Earth and why can anyone not go there.

Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any palnet in our solar system,even though Mercury is closer to our sun. An example that explains this is ""On te planet's surface,temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,and the atmosphere pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". Another detail that supports that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is the planet has a rocky sediment and includes familiar features sach as valleys,mountains,and craters. Also Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit and seems indisputable. An example is ""The value of Venus seems indisputable,but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive"". Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions. At thirty-plus miles above the surface,temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit,but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. It may not be easy conditions,but survivable for humans. Also,Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safety far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere.

One way Venus can not be worthy of despite of the dangers is by looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers and can make calculations by using gears,levers,and do not require electronics at all. Also if you use a phone or tablet to acis or heat capable of melting tin,then those systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure,heat,and other forces.

The scientiest have to study the planet so the people don't die or get hurt while on the planet of Venus. They would have to study the tempereture, air pressure, and the amount of carbon dioxide. In paregraph one it says ""Venus is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, this nickname is misleading since Venus is actully a planet"". The planet is very hot with . the tempereture being around 800 degrees also 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus.

Venus air pressure is 90 times greater than what the experience on our own planet. In paragraph 3 it says ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth"". Venus also has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solor system. Spaceships can't land on the planet for more than a few hours therefore they are trying to make some electronics made of silicon carbide.

The scientest are trying to test the silicon carbide electronic so that it can last on the planet of Venus for more than a couple of hours. In paragragh 7 it says""The silicon carbide electronic has been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"". There are older technology that are called mechanical computers. The device were first envisioned in 1800s.

People would like to know about Venus, danger of it, and the testing for the spaceshuttles to land on. Venus is the second planet away for the sun and the first closets to the earth.

If we're learning so much about the dangers of Venus then why even begin to consider to approach it in any way. Why not push it to the back of the line and continue to study Mars, a place where you can actually step foot on it's surface. Although Venus is shown to be extremley dangerous and risk taking, scientists can't seem to let it slip through the cracks.

Venus is made of about 97% carbon dioxide, has an atmosheric pressure of 90 times greater than Earth, and is considered dangerous but has yet proved to be worthy of studying. The author states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Venus has also been hypothesized that years ago it was likely that Venus was covered largely with oceans and could have even supported many different kinds of life. So despite the challenges the author sumarizes that because it resembles so closely to Earth it wouldn't make sence not to study it and try to rehinder all of the information they can from Venus.

So even though there are several factors that take play in the study of Venus it doesn't seem by the authors statements that they're stopping anytime soon.

They talk about the different dangers in studying Venus, and they also talk about why it is so interesting and why it would be worth studying further.

The author shows this through the text because they clearly state why Venus is considered so dangerous and also why it is so interesting. For example, in paragprah 3, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide...clouds of corrosive sulfuric acid...temperatures average over 800 degress fahrenheit...atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater that what we experience on our own planet."" These are some examples of the dangers that are presented when trying to study Venus.

The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" These are some examples of why we should look more into Venus because it has similar features to Earth and it is interesting to figure out why or how they are similar. The author proves their point by explaining that these dangers could potentially be worked around. In paragraph 7, ""Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditons."" This is showing that while Venus may be very dangerous to observe, there are advanced technologies out there that can lower the risk that comes with studying this planet. As the author stated in paragraph 8, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagaination and innovation."" What the author is trying to get across in this line, is that we should not limit ourselves or limit how much we can know or see solely based on something being too dangerous, when there are innovations out there to make it possible.

The end talks about silicone carbide being tested over Venus's surface.

Venus is a challenging place to examine because it is really close to the sun which makes it hard to examine. According to paragraph 1 it says "" While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vanatage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."" Venus is a hard planet to examine because of how close it is to the sun. None of the spacecraft's have survived the landing to Venus so no spaceships have went to Venus since. According to paragraph 2 it says "" Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."" A spaceship has not went down on Venus because ofthe fails with the space creaft's.

Venus is way hotter than the temperatures is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth . According to paragraph 3 it says ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to the sun."" Even though Mercury is closer to the sun Venus is so hot because of all the erupting valcanoes, earth strikes, and lightning strikes that may land on Venus's surface. Astronomers believe that Venus was once similar to Earth because of its features. Paragraph 4 says ""today venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valley's mountains, and craters."" The Astronomers think since Venus looks similar to Earth because of the rocky, mountains, and valley's type of features.

Some people may think studying Venus isn't a worthy persuit because of how dangerous it could be for astronomers to examine it. People also may think coming up with devices to make scientists float over the surface is putting them in a position of getting hurt due to all the fails that have happened.

In conclusion studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because it will make people more curious about the planet and it will also allow scientists to learn more about the planet and get a better insight up close of the planet rather than far away.

In the planet's surface, tempertures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheris pressure is 90 times greater than we experience on our own planet"". Eventhough, it could be life theathing, there are scientist that want to do test and collect gases and ect to do studies. They want to do studies because they want to learn some much more about Venus.

When you think of how Venus looks like, do you think of craters and the sign of no life? Well, you be somewhat correct because it has a rocky surface, and it looks like valleys, mountain and craters. Although ""[long] ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". Since, there was a possible that there was life forms and etc, scientist want to see if there was some kind of life living up there, but then got exstinted or somethings else happened to them.

So, to rap this all up, scientist know the danger of explore Venus, but sometime you have to do thing that are danger to learn new things. People alway talk about wanting to explore different planets, but they never do it. Yes, there are going to be opsolcules in the way, and there are going to be dangerous things we have do to go there, but it will be worth it in end. Nevertheless, there was forms of life on Venus in the past, why not have life on Venus again.       ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
8B19F3C51A0E,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The reason is, Venus is the second planet from our sun. Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system. Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Even though Venus is despite the danger it presents studying can helps in thr future. The study might not help now but when something happned on Earth, it surely will helps and will be worth it.

569A676ACDB9,"In the artical ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author is explaining the dangers of the exploration Venus. The exploration of Venus is unsurvivable by humans because of the the surface tempatures of 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than Earth's. Scientist are researching technology that can help machines survive the conditions. Therefore, the author of this artical supports the idea of exploring Venus very well by including scientific research and evidence presented from experiments conducted.

The author states a question to get the reader thinking. ""What are the options for making sure such a mission is both safe and scientifically productive."" The reader is now intrugied to find out what the options are now for this great exploration. The autor then explains the options in this statement, ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" which is then supported by the author stating in another paragraph, ""NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks."" This statement shows that the author has evidence to back up his research. All of this research is leading up to the ""big idea"" which is presented by the author when stating,"" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus is to float above the fray."" this statement is then supported by the author explaning the idea, ""Imagine a blimp-like vechicle hovering 30 or so miles abve the rolling Venusian landscape."". The author then goes into futher detail of why one cannot withstand the conditions of Venus by stating, ""a vechicle hovering over Venus would advoid the unfriendly ground coditions by staying up and out of thier way. At thirty plus miles above the surface, tempatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit."" These conditions would be uncomfortable for humans but are survivale for them. The author shows that all of his evidence is supported not only by his opinon but also by scinentific facts and evidence.

In conclusion, the author supports the idea very well. Not only by including information about how unhospitable Venus is but by adding the scintific research and evidence founded by the scientist, One can not only learn but can also form an opinon for themselves about the exploration of Venus from this artical.

This is a memorable event in American history because it was the first American to ever set foot on the moon.

Before Neil made it to the moon, no one thought that it would ever be possible to make it that far.

Now we are planning to explore Venus. The author states that he wants to explore Venus no matter what the percautions are. There are always good and bad effects of each action and the exploration of Venus has a lot of them.

First of all, the author states that Venus is the closest planet to the earth when Mars is not; it depends on their orbits around the sun. With Venus a close distance to the earth, it would be easier to explore than any other planet in the galaxy.

This planet has the most Earth-like features in the Milky Way which makes it attract scientists. There are so many valuable reasons why the exploration of this planet is a good idea.

On the contrary, the most difficult part of the mission is Venus' atmosphere.

Carbon dioxide takes up 97 percent of the atmoshere; also the clouds have highly corrosive sulfuric acid clouds.

If that does not damage a spacecraft, the pressure that is 90 times greater than Earth will. The temperatures there way over exceed the temperatures on Earth; the temperature there averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. NASA has been working on spacecraft to make it there and they are making progress.

Humans have already sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus already; however, none of the spacecraft made it on the planet long enough for any human to survive there.

The author constructed his information very well.

The author explained why NASA wants to explore Venus.

Facts were provided to let the reader know that this article is not just opionated but also factual.

I really liked how the author explained why Venus will be a hard mission to achieve, it shows that NASA knows their weaknesses and therefore will be able to fix them.

NASA has many backup plans in case one of them fail.

In conclusion, this was a well written article.

The author knew what he was talking about which persuaded me to think that studying Venus would benefit science.

FB6C139752AA,"In the text the outhor suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despirate the dangers it represents, which is correct. The text explain correcthy each factor that Venus has, it also explain with details what are the dangers that being on Venus presents.

At the begining the text, the author explain where is located Venus and what are some factors about it. Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus is also the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. Venus temperature avarage is over 800 degrees Farenheit,and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than wht we experience on our own planet, it means that Venus is unable to have humans living there, because the factors like temperature, water, and ways to get food are so complicated. The fact of Venus being the second planet from the sun makes it a lot more dangerous for a human to be there.

Scientifics explain that Venus has the hottes surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun. People ask ""Why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface?"", well Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, it means that Venus was the most similiar of the 8 planets in the solar system that looks more similar to the Earth, they belief that really long time ago Venus was covered with oceans and it could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters, which is another idea that makes the author think about know more about Venus.

Now The National Aeronautics and Space

Administration (NASA) has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. The NASA has some projects in mind to do one of them is to send mechanical computers to Venus to take pictures and videos that way they can have a better idea of how Venus looks like. They are trying to use the same mechanical computers that they use during World War II, because mechanical parts can be made more resistant to preassure,heat, and other forces, it means that the NASA plans to send an electronic device to Venus just to see the place and star planning a visit, the would adap the device that way it could resist the different factor that are fount on Venus.

151F9011BF04,"Venus, otherwise known as the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers. The author supports this claim by stating that the insight to be gained is significant and by offering methods for obtaining these insights despite the danger that is readily appearant.

Venus is one of the most challenging planets to examine due to its very extreme environment. Paragraph 3 of the article is all about the extreme environment that Venus presents. Venus has temperatures over 800 degress Fahrenheit, an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and other obstacles that prove challenging for scientists to overcome. Additionally, Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere which prove to be challenging to scientists. These dangers may seem impossible to overcome, but scientists have been developing new methods to further their knowledge of Venus.

NASA is one organization that has been developing particularly interesting ideas about how to further study Venus. They are considering a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the suface of Venus to meet the challenges presented. This blimp would avoid the poor conditions of the Venusian landscape by floating some thirty miles above the surface. Conditions around the blimp would still be slightly hot, but the pressure and toxicity would be similar to that on Earth. These conditions are not ideal, but they would be sufficient enough to study Venus further. Another one of NASA's ideas is to use mechanical computers to study Venus. These mechanical computers do not require electronics, and they would be more resistant to the poor conditions of the surface. These new innovations in the study of Venus is what makes the dangers tolerable and the study worthy.

According to the article, astronomers are interested in Venus because it was likely the most Earth-like planet in the solar system at one point. Venus used to be covered in oceans and supported life. Additionally, Venus still has features that are similar to Earth's such as a rocky sediment with valleys, mountains, and craters. Insight into the Venusian landscape would further allow astronomers to determine how closely related Earth and Venus were. The author also states that humans should not be limited by their fear to go out and explore. In the final paragraph of the article, the author describes how human curiosity will lead humans into many intimidating expidentures. However, the author believes that travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited simply due to danger, and humans should travel as far as their innovation will take them.

The author of this article supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by stating the insight to be gained from further exploring Venus and by presenting new methods that are making new insights possible. The danger of Venus is extensive due to the high temperatures, extreme atmospheric pressure, and wild weather patterns. These obstacles are being dealt with though by new ideas from scientists at NASA. One big idea from NASA is the idea to use a blimp to observe Venus from above the surface. Another idea of theirs is to use materials that would be able to withstand the extreme conditions of the Venusian environment.

Venus has familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters.

The NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has a possible solution for sending humans to study Venus after three decades. It would allow scientists to float above the fray and avoid the unfreindly ground conditons. Instead of the temperature being 800, it would be lowered to 170 if they used a blimp-like vehicle that would hover 30 or more miles over Venus.

That's why when we tried to land on Venus are craft got distroded .

Venus used to be like earth but mostly not anymore . since Venus is like what its like we can't take samples from rocks,gas etc. we would have to dig deeper into are work so we can find out why Venus is the way it is. Its good that they are working to better are craft to find out more about Venus .NASA is working on something that's seem like it would work well for Venus .

Venus is worthy of studying despite the dangers because if we stop we will never know what it's really like why it does the things it does . If we keep trying we will have the best craft and it will work . I know everybody wants to know if we can have life on a planet and Venus might just be the one . although Venus made it hard for humans to study it also gave them light weight on how to make the craft better and to know that it is dangrous so they know now that they need better craft.

The author says that Venus has many feature like earth and that it may be possible for humans to live there. Even though they have seen what could happen like the bad part of living there, they are still trying to find a way to make humans live there. Venus is like Earths ""twin"" because it is the closest planet to the earth unlike the other planets. Also, Venus atmosphere of carbon dioxide is 97 percent.

Venus may be worth studying for but despite the danger that it may have to any human could be bad and even though the author says that they are going to have to make humans a part of there studyies so they can find a way to live there. In the text it says that ""numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite the proximity to us"" saying that they will have to study humans no matter what.

Therefore, Venus may be wirth to study it but is it really worth putting humans a part of your study just to be right. There are may factors that Venus has that are very dangerous to us. ",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent

People could argue that the effort of studying Venus is useless and ineffective. However, scientists have little to no knowledge of how the planets in our solar system were made. Scientists could have more knowledge of Venus if they found a way to study the planet. The author of the article is right about the exploration of Venus being a worthy pursuit.

The author of the article does mention how difficult it is to study Venus by bringing up the planet's harsh atmosphere in Paragraph 3. Which further proves his point how valuable it is to study Venus. He also points out that Venus may have been a lot like Earth a long time ago in Paragraph 4. This doesn't just further our understanding of Venus, but it may also give us more information about Earth as well.

In Paragraph 5, the author mentions NASA's plans on how to study Venus. He does mention that those plans may have challenges fo their own in Paragraph 6. The author pushes to try those plans out in a realistic manner. The author being realistic with the reader, makes the reader want agree with him more.

The author backs up his suggestion with great evidence, but does it in a realistic way. He realizes how dangerous it is to study, but pushes for it by bringing up how little we know about Venus.

The fact that they are thinking of send people to that planet is relly mind blowing to me. He also did an amazing job at discribing the dangers of the planet and all of the extrem caonditions on the surface like the volcanos and earthquakes as mention in paragraph three.

Also how he mentioned how many veachals have been sent to the planet and how they didnt survived the harsh weather for more than a copple hours. It is very intresting how he discribes the way NASA is trying to deal with the challenges.

the way they have made some progress. such as the silicone carbide electronics that can survive in a simulated or replecated venus up tp 3 weeks are mentioned in paragraph 6. My question is would'nt the silicon melt with the heat on venus that is hotter than mars that is closer to the sun. It is very intresting how they have ideas of how they can have people on venus with the hover crafts that the resurchers would stay on and collect information.

Oneday this earth is going to be imposible to live on and we woill have to move to anoher planet or just die off and honestly we have lived for way to long longer than any other type of animal that has ever lived on this earth. we have survived so many things and eras. Many wars have been foght and many men have dies on this eath just fot the sake of defending there country and having the will honor to die with respect. Other animals have gone we have done too much damage to the earth and taken to many animals to extiton and the oceans are extremly poluted many fish are just dying off and peolpe cant seem to know why but the harsh truth is that the wrold is ending and there is no going back now.

Humans hve changed climet pattens and know evey year it seems like the storms are getig stronger and the summers are geting hotter. The winters are taking longer to arive. and longer to leave volcano eruptions are almost common now evry year ut seems like a volcano want to erupt and sometimes it dose other times its just the ash that kills peolpe. What im trying to get at is that we really should'nt be exporing other planets when we dont even know what 98% of our oceans havent even been expored we need to learn how to take care of this planet before we even think about moving on to another planet or we will do the samething. The goverments dont seem to care much about the subject and act like its not happening.

He also support it by including Earth, Venus ,and Mars are goes by different speed; Venus is sometimes right around the conner but sometimes we far from it and closer Mars.

Second, I can tell that the authors research about the past ,because in the article in paragraph 2"" each previous mission was unmanned, no spacecarft survived, and not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"" shows he actually know about spacecraft and about 3 decades ago. Also, in paragraph 7 he also conclude about first envisioned in 1800s and 1940s during World War ll.

Finally, in the author included about how NASA will be keep challenging to get to the Venus safely and how they will going to working on a machines that last long enought to contribute meaningfully knowledge of venus. This shows that the author researched about how NASA Challenging to get to Venus. To support my sentence, In paragraph 7 "" eletronics made of silicon carbide have lasted for three weeks"".

477BCBA4035E,"Throughout reading this article I thought it provided very good and extensive research. Although I did see some major issues with the leading point of the passage. This author provided very good research but the research and evidence throughout the entire article controdicted their main message. To make this article better, more evidence on why studying venus is benefical should be provided to support their claim.

In this article the evidence they use for example: ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"" and also ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" supports the controdicting claim that going to Venus is too dangerous with too many complications. Throughout the whole passage the author states many reasons on why it's too dangerous to go to Venus and all the complications that would happen if going there. They also show all the major problems with NASA's idea of a solution, but never came up with their own possible idea of a solution. This leads you to believe that the author is against going to Venus. I dont disagree that going to Venus will gain us insight on the planet, spark imagination, and create innovation but the author's claim needs to be more supported and obvious throught the passage.

Some good things about this passage is that they do provide great evidence and research. They provide input from NASA and NASA's insight on the whole thing and a possible solution. They also provide facts about the atmosphere and about the conditions of the planet. Them providing all this evidence helps the reader themselves have almost enough information to come up with their own opinion on the topic. Although I still stand by this article needing much more information on why and how we could go to Venus safe and affectively.

Overall this article's information and research was great and really did inform me about the planet, but the conclusion ruiened it all. The whole time (paragraphs 1-7) the author lead all the readers to believe that going to Venus has too many dangers and isnt in our best interest, yet the conclusion stated that going to Venus would be a great oppurtunity and that ""Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". If the passage had evidence all throught that going to Venus is beneficial, it would be a perfect article but i was all around confused when I found out the author was all for going to Venus and it ruiened and confused the whole article.

0E7310FC907B,"The author says that NASA's possible solution would be allowing scientists to float above the fray like how airplanes and jets float above storms. As they say in paragraph 5 ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landcape."" NASA says the it wouldn't be as hot but it would still be 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Its not very easy but humans will still be able to survive.

Personally I think its still dangerous because 170 degrees Fahrenheit is still really hot, the tempature on earth isn't that high. Also the passage says in paragraph 6 ""Researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else."" The passage says that because if NASA is going to have them floating above the premises they wont be able to conduct experiments because, they won't be able to take anything. Also because if just floating above the premises is 170 degrees Fahrenheit then when you get further down it'll be hotter so that means that if they try to grab a rock it could burn through gloves and possibly leave them with serious burns.

But NASA is working on other approaches because in pargraph 7 the passage says ""Some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" The author says in paragraph 8 "" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

In paragraph 2 it shows that they have tried numerous times to send little spacecrafts to Venus but they have only been there for a few hours which is dangerous because if a spacecraft only stays there for a few hours imagine how long a human could stay there without over heating or coming back with serious health issues.

The author says in paragraph 2 ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.""But there are numerous factors to why Venus is a challenging planet for humans to study as they explain it in third paragraph.

In pargraph 3 the passage says ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus' atmosphere."" Which makes it a whole lot dangerous for humans to travel there to conduct experiments.

B131205A86C4,"In ""The Challege of Exploring Venus,"" the author says that further study of the planet Venus would be a worthy pursuit for humanity. Closer examination of Venus presents many dangers, but despite this, the author still believes that learning more about Venus would be worth while. The author supports his belief by explaining some of the curiosities that draw humans to Venus--such as the posibilty of having had life previously--, by comparing Venus to our home planet of Earth, and by exploring some of the ideas for how Venus could be explored.

In order to convince the reader that further exploration of Venus is worth the risk, the author peaks the reader's interest with ideas about the planet. The author knows that the idea of life existing outside of Earth is common thought for most people, so he tosses out the possiblity of Venus having previously supported life. He states that Venus was likely covered in oceans previously and, ""could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Life on other planets has fascinated people for generations, and the author decides to use this to try and convince the reader that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers its presents.

The author continues to explain the reasons to further explore Venus, which he begins to aid with facts. The author describes how close Venus is to Earth, relatively speaking. He says that at times Venus is the closest planet to Earth. The author also decsribes the similarities that Venus has to Earth, including size, density, and surface. This author uses facts that support his claim to try and convince the reader of his idea, which works well in this case.

Like any good argument, the author highlights some counter arguments, and then gives possible solutions. For example, the author explains the harsh conditions of Venus such as high temperature and high atmospheric pressure. The author even tells the reader that, ""no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours."" All of these seem like deal breakers, but the author does a good job of countering these points with solutions. The author describes ideas from NASA, such as a ""blimp-like vehicle"" that would float about thirty miles above the surface of Venus and avoid many of the harshest conition. He also disusses the use of electronics made of silicon carbide that would be better equipped to handle the intense conditions of Venus. The author looks at flaws in his idea, and finds solutions to them.

The author of this article believes that while studying Venus poses some challenges and dangers, but that it would be worth it. He explains why people are interested in Venus, and why it is a task that can be accomplished. He looks at counter points to his idea, and finds ways around them. This author effectively supports his idea that studying Venus is worth the dangers it presents.",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
EE9531CFE76D,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" The author explains why it would be a good idea to explore our neighboring planet of Venus. Despite all of the possible problems that can easily arise, the author claims it is a worthy pursuit. From evaluating the article personally, I believe the author supported his argument very well with even being able to counterargue many counterclaims by stating different innovations and different ideas that can make travelling to the ""Evening Star"" a reality.

The author claims it is important to study Venus due to it's striking similarities to Earth. The author states in paragraph 4 that scientists believe that Venus was once the most similar planet to Earth, once believed to probably be covered in oceans and probably even supported life. Even today, it is speculated that Venus has many land masses like ours such as mountains, valleys, and craters. The author also states in paragraph 4 that Venus can easily be our nearest option for a planetary visit considering how close it is.

Although, the horrible conditions of the planet have not allowed any human made spacecrafts to land on Venus for more than a few hours before being either torn apart or simply returning. However, after this claim from paragraph 5, the author uses support from NASA to state how humans could still visit the planet, however, will have to only hover over it about 30 miles into the atmosphere to avoid getting into serious danger. The author claims that although these still are not perfect conditions, they will be suitable for humans to survive in. The author then goes on to compell the arguement that they would not be able to collect any samples or even photo or videograpghy due to it being dangerous or ineffective. He therefore states in paragraph 6 that if scientists are seeking to conduct a thorough mission, that they need to get up close and personal with the planet.

The author also states in paragraph 6 as well how many scientists take Venus as a challenge and are actually coming up with different innovations in order to tackle Venus' tough environment with a surface that can reach up to 800°F and the immense 90 times greater pressure than Earth. These technologies include mechanical parts like found in the first computer had in order to be more resistant to heat and pressure being made from silicon carbide, which when tested in a chamber that simulated Venus conditions, survived a staggering 3 weeks.

Later, in paragraph 8, the author states that being presented a challenge to get to Venus has value. ""Not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us to many equally intimidating endeavors,"" the author states in paragraph 8. The author claims that if we are able to tackle an astonashing feat such as Venus who is our neighboring planet, then we have unlocked the key to tackling many greater challenges.

In conclusion, I believe the author supports his claims very well due to him being able to understand the dangers of the challenge. However, the author then was able to find different supporting facts and innovations that can make a trip to Venus by man possible and seem more appealing nevertheless.

A615D47180DF,"The author uses many details from the article to support his claim that Venus is worthy pursuit desipte the dangers it presents by telling the reader how dangerous Venes is.

These details he gives us about the conditions Venus has are far to exterme, but the author says it survivable for humans.

A second, detail that the author gives use is about NASA trying to collect samples of rocks so they can study. But most of the robots they send to Venus get destroyed because of the choas that happens there. Another project that they did was that they used technology called mechanical computers. These mechanical conputers are are powerful, flexible, and quick but the are delicate when it comes to extreme conditions.

A third detial, that the author gave us information about the text was that not even a single space ship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.

A8BA15606564,"Venus is a place that all scientists these days are completely interested in. The reason why they are so into Venus is because first off, how Venus is called ""Our Sister Planet"" which means that Venus has some similar living conditions as Earth does. For example, Venus was origionally filled with mostly oceans that could've supported various forms of life, just like Earth. The planet according to the article used to or still has familiar features such as Valleys, mountains, and even living/moving creatures. Which makes Venus sound like it was origionally Earth, but you'd be worng there, because Venus has extreme weather conditions such as temperature getting up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit, or the atmospheric pressure is 90 times more greater than what we experience on Earth. This is my story.

Venus is an interesting planet that scientists have been studying for generations on generations. With the information I gave from the article above would bafle any person in the world. A claim that I'm about to tell you will support the author of this article's idea that we should look more into Venus. For example, the information I gave above in the intro are some reasons why we should look into it more. Another reason why scientists should look at Venus more is, because even though it had all of those similar living conditions as Earth has, there's some drastic conditions that'll still make it non-livable. Some things that'll make a difference is Venus' weather conditions, Temperature is at an average of 800 degrees Fehrenheit. Another is because the air pressure would be at the same amount Earths Ocean's are at, which is not livable at all. And another example is that Venus has extreme thunder/ lightning and rainstorms which frequently hit the ground and would cause a lot of fires.

My final thoughts on this topic is we should study Venus because even though the thing I'm going to give as an example is not on the article. We should study Venus a lot more because, Venus used to or still does have some of the same living conditions, but when the planet has storms or has other negative issues, the planet Venus can get extremely violent naturally. And their weather conditions compared to ours on Earth are drastic, and make our hurricanes or other form of a storm that we think is terrible and powerful (which they are), will make us and Earth feel incredibly weak.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent

For example, in paragraph 3, the author states that ""a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"". This example show the evident danger that Venus holds. Another example of the author showing the dangers of Venus is the author states, ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"".

Though, on the other hand, the author also gives the idea that Venus is worth exploring despite all of its dangers. One example being when the author says, ""astonomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Eath-like planet in our solar system"". This shows that the author believes that Venus is a worthy planet to be explored despite the danger it holds.

Another example of how the author supports theri claim is that they used factual information in the article.

5FBFB86A1E8E,"Thre has been no spacecraft to ever land there more than a couple hours. That means it would be immpossible for any human or any living thing to even enter its thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets. This explains why the author is explaining why the pursuit is dangerous, A long time ago the autor stes that Venus probaly had a ocean like earth and many other forms of life as well, and Just because it can be really dangerous to try to even visit Venus that does not mean we will not try.

The author suggests that studdying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite dangers it presents and it could be immpossible. The author states that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"" (para.3). This explains the accertion because it would kill us as soon as we enterted in the atmosphere. So that would mean that it would be very dangerous to pursuit Venus.

A long time ago Venus was just like Earth. The autor states that ""Long ago, Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" (Para 4). This explains that Earth wasjust like Earth a long time ago because it was covered largely with oceans. Another reason it was just like Earth was it could have supported many other forms of life as well.

Just because it's really dangerous to pursuit Venus that doesn't mean we are going to stop trying to send people to Venus. The National Aeroand Space Administration (NASA) has stated that NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"" (para 5). NASA explained that it would be really dangerous to pursuit Venusbut they have ways around it. They said they would go 30 miles above the surface so they would not harm the people.

3CEF69F60CAF,"Venus, along with Mars are the closest planets to Earth, they also at one point or another might have been similar to our planet. Yet, we have explored Mars much more than we have Venus. Venus has left us mind-boggled on how to study it with it's dangerous conditions, such as the thick acid rain, the average temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Though the exploation is worth these risks for we can explore a planet that scienctists believe could have been once similar our own. Nasa has developed many ideas and solutions to hopefully find new ways to study one of the closest planets to us.

The first way that NASA has created to help us observe Venus is a blimp-like plane to fly over Venus. This idea of the vehicle is stated in paragraph 5, ""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly gorund conditions by staying up and out of their way."" Also later on in this paragraph where it states, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."" Now these conditions would most defintely be harsh, but would be capable of living through, escpecially astronauts who are/would be trained for these conditions. This would at least give us an above look of Venus and be able to study some of it's physical features.

The problem that NASA would now have is figuring out a way to study up close and on the surface of Venus. They have a solution for this issue as well in the form of old World War 2 computers, the solution to this problem is explained in paragraph 7 as it says,""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers..."" Also further on in the paragraph it reads,"" The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" And even later in paragraph seven it states, ""By comparsion, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces."" These older computers would be able to be dropped down onto the surface of Venus and take samples of the terrain and it's geological features allowing NASA and it's scientists to study the information gather and create better models to study more of Venus and understand the planet.

Another way NASA is thinking to study Venus on it's surface is simple electronics, the ideas and princples of these machines are stated in the beginning of paragraph where it states, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" The simplified electronics would be used the same way as the mechancial computers, in which to study the terrain of Venus and collect data from Venus and to send it back to NASA allowing them to study the data.

Venus is a very interesting planet with many disadvantages and conflicts like the difficulty of being able to study the planet's terrain or even to be able to observe the planet in a hover-like state from above. If the challenges that NASA faces can be solved with solutions stated above, then Venus could be a very worhty pursuit, so that we may discover the secrets of one of the closest planets to us.

In the article it says, ""However, peering at Venus for a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere."" With making up a solution to Venus' extreme conditions, there are now more problems that come across because of the solution that protects them from the major conditions.

In conclusion, scientist should go and study Venus disregaurding the major conditions. These scientist are very careful and aware of the risk of being on Venus, so they came up with a solution so they don't have to encounter the many harads. You should always go explore things you want to, but you should be aware of risk so you know what to do during the challenge of trying to explore somthing new.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
AD61576E5147,"The the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author argues that humans should continue our attempts to land in the planet. Despite describing the dangers of the daunting task, the author provides several thought provoking arguments to support his/her claim.

One argument is that Venus is the most viable option for a planetary visit from the human race. Venus is almost identical in density and size compared to Earth, and may have had extremely similar enviroments and biomes long ago. Today, we can still recognize land shapes such as mountains, valleys, and what might have been oceans long ago. This provides evidence that Venus may have supported many life forms in the past, and could very well do the same again. If Humans can find a way to survive on the planet, we could possible have a second Earth,

The author also lists several innovations that would assist humans in teh examinationa nd exploration of Venus. One is a blimp-like station that would float approximately 30 miles above Venus' surface. Doing this would allow scientists to avoid the treacherous ground conditions and storms. Being above the storms would also give scientists and almost infonite amount of solar energy, and though conditions would be extreemly hot, there would be no danger of radiation.

Modified technology could also be created to function of Venus' harsh terrain. Instead of using the fragile electronic tablets and computers of today, scientists could use a machine that was used in WW2, known as the mechanical computer. The mechanical computer used gears and levers to make calculations, and didn't require any electricity. This machine could be easily modified to widthstand dangerous conditions. Other simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a simulated venus atmosphere and lasted several weeks in the conditions.

With careful planning and a new approach, humans could have a chance of getting onto Venus. the author claims that after stepping up to this challenge, the human race would be prepared for more dangerous endeavors. As the saying goes, the sky is the limit, but we aren't limited to one sky.",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
57CE6ED06513,"In this article the author is telling us that facts about Venus how it's called the ""Evening star"" because it's the ""brightest points of the light in the sky night"" and it is a good place to examine, because of how close it is to the sun and earth, of its tempature, its heat, pressure, and how no spacecraft have landed there. But it's really dangerous in Venus.

It's dangerous in because, a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent cardon dioxide blankets venus, their is also clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere, on the plants surface temperatures avaerage over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater then whats in our earth.

And If they were to explore venus NASA would need scientist to survive the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus. They would need to make blimp-car like vehicles they need to hover for miles and miles becuase it's is 170 degrees fahrenheit which means they would burn real bad. and the lights need to be real good because they need to penetrate the dense of the atmosphere.

I think they shouldn't explore Venus because it's a suicide mission it's too hot a lot of co2 and temperatures reach over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
EDA5B6362E61,"The author gives several points as to why exploring Venus is a good move scientifically. For one, it could provide some information regarding how our planets were formed. Venus is the sister planet to Earth, and as the passage says, it could've once had the capabilities of sustaining life, and exploring it might give some insight on what caused it to become so uninhabitable. The fact that all previous attempts to land spacecraft on Venus, well, didn't work, designing a machine that is able to withstand the harsh conditions that Venus presents is pretty challenging, but

NASA claims it can be done. They say having a vehicle floating abouve the chaos that is Venus' atmosphere would be feasable. we'd also have to take a step back in the technology department. Mechanical computers, which were a huge help in WWll, don't require electronics, but use gears and levers to make calculations. Another possibility is simplified electronics, made from silicon carbide. The simplified devices have been tested in conditions similar to Venus, and lasted for three weeks.

So while exploring Venus will prove to be a great challenge, it can be done.      ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent

In this passage it explains all of the faults of a planet so close to us. The planet Venus, has weather issues and is one of the brightest points in our solar system. Although it can seem dangerous to even want to explore this planet, it has its reasons why it should be explored.

This planet is a planet NASA has attempted to explore. Due to the conditions of Venus they have failed to learn very much. It has been 30 years since a spaceship has touched down on venus. In paragraph 3, it states, ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."" It then goes on to explain the temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These conditions are not suitible for humans on Earth. With these issues, scienticts are still ready to know more about this planet. The author shows even though the planet has many faults, these are the things scientists need to discover and understand.

Venus is often reffered to as our planet Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest to our is density and size. In paragraph 4, the author says Venus is the most Earth like planet. They believe Venus was covered with oceans and could have supported forms of life as Earth is able to. Venus also has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes on its surface. The weather on Venus is similar to some of the weather we get on Earth. Scientists want to see how many more similarities Venus has with Earth. Venus could also have a species more capable of their contitions.

Venus is also one of the brightest points of light in our night sky. ""Evening Star,"" which is another nickname for Venus, makes it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. Venus is the second planet from the sun. Venus being one of the planets closest to us and one of the few planets almost anyone cansee even from home makes it easier and easier to find reasons that scientists feel the need to explore such places. My own classmate herself once told me ""We need to start learning more about Venus. It could mean so much to have knowledge of our sister planet.""

I believe studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because, Venus is one of th brightest points in the sky, it is reffered to as Earth's ""twin,"" and this planet is so inhospital that a spacecraft could'nt survive a landing for more than a few hours. In the passage, the author shows evidence to support their reasons as to why Venus has value. All the reasons listed show how Venus can be of value to scientists. It is important for the scientists to understand why the weather is the way it is and how similar Venus is to Earth. We could live there or we could meet a new species.

2AF255C9402C,"The author of this story does not support the idea of Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. in this article, there is only evidence supporting all the challenges that venus brings to us. The author gave no reason or claim to why a dangerous trip to venus would benefit us in any way. The author of this article does include evidence and facts about how hard it would be to get to Venus and all the challenges we would have to undergo to get to Venus.

In this article the author claims that going to Venus is hard but worthy. What makes Venus so worthy? ""often referred to as earth's ""twin"", Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of denisty and size."" says the article of this passage in paragraph 2. but then in paragraph 2 he states that Venus has a ""thick atmoshpere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets"" and ""clouds of highly corrosive sulfiric acid"" ""temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and "" atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"". The author gave all this evidence of the challenges we were facing to get to venus but he does not say why it is beneficial to us. he gives us more reasons to not want to go to venus.

in conclusion, this author does not support his claim of venus being worthy despite all the dangers and challenges it brings.

636950C6D238,"I will be making an essay how the author supports the idea that studying Venusis a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Well Venus is actually the second plant on the Earth. Venus have challenging place to examine more closely. I really don't thing that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite. What ever that means but the author has give us so many things about venus.

One reason that I have found in the passage is that Venus is more than three decades. Venus reputation as a challenging planet for humans could travel to the planet if Venus, but how will they come back home. Well I don't know how they will be going back home. Even more challenging are the clouds of hightly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere. Most importantly reseachers well I mean the author cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth. It can sometime be our nearest option for a planetary visit. How I said in the beginning people can go to Venus for a trip, but how are they coming back home.

The second reason that I have found in the passage is that NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. Its solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Its not easy conditions but survivable for humans. Venus have never had a ship landing in that planet. Venus from a ship orbiting or havering safely far above the planet can provice only limited insight on ground. Because most forms of light cannot penetrate to Venus. This is in the passage,some simplifiled elecronica made of silicon carbide have been tested ina chamber simiulating the chaos venus surface and have lasted fro three weeks in such conditions.

9C88FA75BF98,"Have you ever travled to another planet? If not here are some points and tips on ""The challenge of exploring Venus."" First the planet Venus is much earth-like. It can cover large lands with oceans. Venus can support various forms of life such as moutains,craters,valleys etc... Still to this day Venus still has earth like features.

Next, NASA has come up with some helpful things to help people traveling up to Venus. NASA's possible soultion for the condtions is to try and make it to where they can allow scientists to float above the surface. They say that the solar power would be plentiful and would not exceed earth levels. NASA is also doing stuff with the machines like innovations that allows people to know the knowledge of Venus.

Then, The sudies for Venus are pretty neat. The text states that,""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the cahos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Scientist also say that they think the modern computres are powerful and quick to use for studies like this. It can be resistant to the heat etc.

Finally, Despite the chanlleges and dangers they are all striving to meet the challenge. It has a lot of value to them. They want this research and all to go good because of the human curiosity. The travlers should not be limited by dangers and doubts on exploring venus. So, looking forward to exploring Venus?       ",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
B8A1DB607D3B,"Could Earth end up turning out like Venus? NASA has sent many spacecrafts to Venus trying to figure out what it is like under the atmosphere. Although it may seem like a waste of time to send stuff there, studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers because it can teach us more about our solar system, it can possibly be a replacement planet, and if we find out that it was like Earth we could try and fix Earth before it happens again.

Studying the planet Venus would help us better understand the rest of our solar system. The taxt says ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide blankets Venus (Paragraph 3)."" It also states ""and the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet (Paragraph 3)."" We haven't seen anything like this, which is why we need to study it.

Venus could possibly be a replacement planet for Earth. We just need to find out how we could make it a liveable planet incase the Earth just keeps getting worse and worse. It states ""Often referred to as Eath's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size (Paragraph 2)."" The text also states that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth (Paragraph 4)."" These mean that at one point we couldv'e lived on Venus since it was so much like Earth.

If we were to keep studying Venus and we find lots out about it then we could see if Earth would eventually turn out like that. As stated ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth (Paragraph 4)."" Another point is that ""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth...such as valleys, mountains, and craters (Paragraph 4)."" This says that Earth and Venus look a lot alike and they could be ""twin"" planets which also means that the Earth could end up one day being just like Venus.

We need to study more about Venus to help out ourselves and the Earth, so we don't end up like Venus. They either need to send ships to research Venus to help Earth or having to find another planet for our future generations to live on. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
EB3398FD0FF5,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author states that exploring Venus would be an immense challenge to overcome due to all of the extremely harsh conditions. Venus, also known as the ""Evening Star,"" is an extremely dangerous planet to explore. Even though scientists are aware of these difficult factors, people like the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" still think that being informed about this bright point of light is worth it.

According to astronomers, Venus may have at one point been the planet with the most Earth-like features. Venus is said to now have a ""surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" These characteristics are one of the reasons as to why the author states that Venus is a pursuit worth risking many things for. Another reason is because in paragraph 4, the author states ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit."" Although these are all fair reasons to want to visit Venus once again, astronomers have to keep in mind all of the negative characteristics that will set their exploration behind. All astronomers and explorers are well aware of all of the challenging conditions such as the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere and the atmospheric pressure being 90 times greater in Venus than the pressure in Earth. These are not the only challenging conditions; another dangerous feature is that temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit in Venus's surface.

Consequently, the author states in paragraph six that there are now many scienstist searching for technology that will be able to stand the harsh conditions in Venus: ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" In the previous paragraph, the author informs the readers about an idea that NASA has thought of. The plan for sending people to study Venus would not give the necessary information to be properly informed of this volatile planet. All of these obstacles are not enough to calm human's desire of knowledge about unearthly topics. In paragraph eight, the author says that all of the challenges are not enough to mellow down our curiosity enough to quit studying Venus.

In conclusion, the claim about Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents that the author of ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" states is well supported by facts and perfectly thought out ideas. Although Venus is an extremely dangerous planet packed with many reasons as to why exploration is currently held back, NASA is still looking for ways to be able to gain more valuable insight about the Evening Star. Just like the author said, learning and travelling should not be limited by doubts, and scientists will not let doubts and fears stop them. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent
B382F142AD2D,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" I disagree with the authors claim strongly. One of the reasons I diagree with this claim is because in the passage it says""Each previous mission was unamnned ,and for a good reason,since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. This tells me as a reader that why should we take such a big risk on losing so much money on a mission if we can barely survive on the surface for a few hours. Also the clouds on venus are made out of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. The surface tempature on venus averages 800 degrees Fahrenheit,and the atmospheric preasure on venus is 90 times greater then what humans experience on earth. This tells me as a reader that trying to explore venus would be a great challenge and would have a lot of consequences to it.

The idea of Nasa of having a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the roiling Venusian landscape is basically pointless. The humans that would live on these vehicles would have to live through harsh conditions but they can survive. Why would you put someones life in danger and have them suffer for a planet that we cannot live..Even if we did this mission we wouldnt be able to take photographs and videography since the atmosphere is so thick. In The passage also says""More importantly,researchers cannot take samples of rock,gas,or anything else from a distance"". This means that we wouldnt be able to take anything off the planet and all the mission would be good for is sightseeing.

In conclusion I disagree with the author and his claim saying that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents. The reason i say this is because exploring venus has to many risks and it could cost lives of humans. In my point of view humans are priceless and they should not risk their lives on a planet that is not habitable. Also even if the mission was sucessful we would not gather many samples on venus due to the fact that the atmosphere is so thick and the conditions on venus is unhabitable. I personally believe that maybe in the future we should have a mission to venus ,but right now knowing all the risks that exploring venus has, that we should work on the technology more and make sure that in the future exploring venus and learning more about it will be possible in the future.

The rare and extreame conditions found in Venus are no were near those of Earth; meaning it doesn't have the capasity to sustain human life. The article ""The Change of Exploring Venus"" indicated these dangers, and the lack of equipt technology with the ability to servive in Venus' atmospher. Many scientist find studing Venus worthy, despite the dangers. The author does a pore good supporing this idea, becasue the main focus of the article was the negative side of studying Venus.

One of the article main points was the difficulty of human acces to Venus. ""... no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" Demenstarating, the danger and almost none existing survival late of a human being. "" The condidtions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth..."" indicating the incopasity of human to rome Venus. These two quotes from the articel indicates the articles focus on the non survivable atmosper and conditions on Venus, this controdiction the idea of Venus being worth sudying.

The next point he articel cfocused on was the technology available and its capasity on Venus. ""For example, some simplified elecronics... have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Indicating, that techoology can not support Venus consitions for long, despite its advancemnts. ""Modern computers are enormously powerful, fexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" Therefore, this demonstrates how Venus atmospher and condition is dangeres even to our most modern technology. Refuring to the incapability to substain the copasity to keep humans alive for long after reaching Venus atmospher.

Finally, the article never indicated why the study of Venus was important. The first four paragraphes focus on the the conditionds of Venus and what would be found in it. These paragraphes give no indication of how Venus affect the Eather or those living in it. most of what remains of the article focuses on the posible advancemnets and ideas or techological difficulities. These things also have no impact on the importance of studing Venus, rather creat another reason not to. These detail, though their purpose is to inflorme and inspire a desire to study Venus only creates a sence of uneasines and un-worthiness.

The author states that ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This is one of his many reasons why we should explore Venus, because in the future it could possibly be our new home. The author also states that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various types of life."" This is yet another example the author presents to show why Venus is so worthwhile. So one of the main reasons the author believes Venus is a worthy cause despite its dangers, is because in the future it could possibly be our new home.

The author also states that

""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author means if we can get past the challenges of Venus it will allow us to face other challenges in the future. The author tells us that we should ""not be limited by dangers and doubts,"" and that we should explore into the ""very edges of imagination and innovation."" The author wants Venus to just be a stepping stone in our long journey of challenges. The author wants it to be something we overcome and get past so we can explore and learn new things.

Even with the many dangers the auhtor stated we can all see exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit. Dangers such as: 800 degree weather, the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than Earths, and the sulfuric acid clouds are some of the many challenges preventing us from exploring Venus close up. To overcome these the author hints at a need for stronger materials and a way to survive the temperatures and pressures in such an environment . But the author has hope that we will figure all of this out. The author even states that a material called silicon carbide has been tested in conditions such as Venus's and have shown to last up to three weeks. He also states that we are thinking of using old mechanical computers to send to Venus because they can be made more durable. So the authors hope for exploring Venus close up may be made into a reality.

So in conclusion the authors support of his belief that studying Venus is a worthy cause despite the dangers it presents are strong and have many benefits.

In paragraph 8 it states ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" That quote shows that he wants to study Venus even though there's danger, he thinks overcoming those challenges will better humanity. Still on paragraph 8 the text says ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This statement shows that no doubt or possible dangers should stop or limit us from exploring. This shows that he thinks we need those challenges to meet the limit of our imagination and innovation.

The author shows evidence that Venus holds some information of the history of our solar system and of itself. Like in paragraph 4 the text states "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth.""

NASA is working on a solution for humans to study Venus in a new way. As stated in the article ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rooling Venusian landscape.""(Paragraph 5). He's saying they are trying to create a vehicle that will let them study mars from above instead of landing on the planet. This supports his idea because this solution that they're creating is, ""survivable for humans"" (paragraph 5).

He describes many features, interesting feautres about Venus. In the article it states that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit,"" (paragraph 3). This a true fact that might spark the interests of humans to study Venus a bit more. Also he states that "" Venus may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" (paragraph 4). Who wouldn't want to study a planet that could've possibly had life exsistence since it was so Earth-like.

Studying Venus is a huge challenge. It has proved that in many ways but that's another reason why the author encourages us to study it. He feels as stated in the article, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" (paragraph 8). Meaning that we should not limit our studies because of danger. His opinion is that we should keep studying, ""to meet the vey edges of our imagination"", (paragraph 8). We shouldn't have to imagine things that we have opportunities to see it real life.
