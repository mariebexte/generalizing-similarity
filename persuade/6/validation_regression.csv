2A1267B9AD16,"Would you like to know more about Venus? In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author explains Venus very well. This article has a lot of great infomation.

In the article is said that it is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. If they was up in the air it would be cooler. ""At thirty plus miles about the surface, temeratures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth. This quote explains what people would do just to see the surface of Venus.

The article also talks about how venus could have been an earth like planet. If Venus was like an earth like planet it would be worth the dangers to go see the planet in person. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largley with oceanss and could have supported variousforms of life just like earth"". In this quote the author is explaining what Venus looked like a long time ago. This is another reason he state why going to venus would be worth the dangers.

It also state that it would be good for human curiosity. If we traveled to Venus we could really find out what it is made up of. ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has vale, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". In this quote the author explains some thing we would get out of traveling to Venus and that why it would be worth the dangers.

in this article the author explains a lot of good reasons on why we should visit Venus. Even though the dangers of it it would be worth the infomation. It would give Asronomers alot of good information about our sister planet that we may never know.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
0EEFA1AEA0FE,"Venus, the second planet from our sun, the ""Evening Star"" as some say is referred to as Earth's ""twin."" The atmosphere of this raging planet is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, the clouds are formed of highly corrosive sulfuric acid, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth. This planet named Venus is deemed inhospitable by the author of this passage, yet the author feels he/she should express and support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

The author supports the idea that Venus may have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Venus has a rocky surface of sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The author also includes the statement that long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been working on different types of equipment to be able to behold many different methods to send technology to Venus. The author states that this technology will allow humans to further understand Venus's complex array of difficulties presented by wanting to send exploration teams to the planet.

The author allows the reader to have a clear view into why it is valuable to be able to have the tools to explore Venus in the near future. He/she shows that human curiosity could lead us into situations where we need this certain technology to help us with different challenges presented in the future. Humans have a lot to learn not only about the problems we face when trying to meet exploration needs, but to gain the valuable insight the author states learning about Venus has. Striving to meet the challenges presented by Venus could lead humans into expanding their knowledge to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation the author feels so strongly that humans should aspire to reach.

3F94E51E4226,"The author claim is that NASA is working on a way to visit venus despite how dangerous it is. They are planning on how they are going to visit Venus wihtout being harmed. In the author claim the reason they thought of ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"" is to show that even though it could be dangerous to go to Venus but they imagination of Venus makes them want to visit it discover things. The author claim could also be that nothing is impossible because reguardless of how dangerous Venus is Nasa still wants to go and explore it.

In Paragraph 6 it describes how NASA is palnning on visiting Venus despite the dangers . In the text it says , However, perring at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions becausze most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere , rending stand forms of photography and videography ineffective. "" This shows that they are still planning to visit Venus despite its dangers .

The text also states how they are trying to visit Venus without being harmed . In paragraph 6 it says "" At thirty - plus miles about surface , a vehical hovering oevr Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. "" This shows how NASA is pannign the trip but without getting harmed.

"" My last author claim is that the author belives that nothing is impossible . Reguardless of how dangerous Venus is for the NASA people to visit they still want to make it possible to go. In paragraph 8 it says , ""

Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This shows how the author claim can be nothing is impossible .

In conclusion the author claim presents how the author is planning how to get to Venus , how to get to Venus without being harmed, and how nothing is impossible.

In my first claim in paragraph 6 Nasa is planning on how to get to Venus. In the text it says "" However, perring at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on the ground conditions becausze most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere , rending stand forms of photography and videography ineffective.

This shows how the author claim is proven that they are planning on how to get to Venus . My second author claim that NASA is finding a way they can get to Venus without being harmed is proved in parahraph 6. In the text it says , """" At thirty - plus miles about surface , a vehical hovering oevr Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. "" For my last author claim that NASA believes anything is possible is presented in paragraph 8. In the text it says , ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" For these reasons proves my author claims that no matter how dangerous Venus is the author belives it is still worthy to discover.   ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
9A3D0EC89E65,"Earth is the third planet in our solar system , and the big rock we humans inhabit in todays time. Living on Earth, conditions are pretty good with inhabitable surface temperature, low atmospheric pressure, and breathable air. Our space neighbors, however, aren't so lucky. The two closest planets to Earth are Mars and Venus. Venus, however, is the most closely related to Earth is density and size, and distance in some cases. The only problem is that Venus has a very harsh landscape, and humans even fitted with the most capable technology wouldn't last very long . So,why should we study Venus if its one of the most dangerous neighbors you could ever have? The author who wrote this article claims that Venus's surface can reach over 800 degrees fahrenheit , and have an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earths. The author emphazises, though, on the fact that Venus ""may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" The author then proceeds to elaborate on this, stating that Venus may have once covered with various lifeforms and may have been covered largely with oceans, and that studying Venus could solve some of the biggest planetary mysteries . Paragraph 4 states, ""Today, Venus still has some planetary features analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" The author then proceeds to state how The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been exploring some ideas to send humans to Venus for studies. Paragraph 5 states, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape... a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.""

In Paragraph 8, the author then concludes with stating that , ""meeting the challenge presented by Venus has value."" The one thing the author did not clearly address in the article is why studying Venus' landscape would be benificial , and worth risking lives. The author states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

7CA79A805C92,"Wow! Did you know that Venus have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system? It was the second planet from our sun. Venus is very similar to earth. it was often called earth's rwin. It was one of the brighest points of light in the night sky. Scienctist tried to study Venus but they could not because they don't have devices that can stay longer than a week on Venus. The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Next, Venus is very similar to Earth. The Venus was often called Earth's twin because if you look at the Venus the color was blue and they believed taht Venus was probably covered largely with oceans. Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size and the distance are closest too. Just like in earth the Venus has a surface of rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. It was our nearest option for a planetary visit. It was one of their challenge to get to Venus and study about it. ""The Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.

Second, photography and videography, and researches cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, Scienctist tried to study the Venus but they couldn't because they don't have any techonology that can be sent to Venus. Sometime they thought that sending people to Venus but since it was dangerous. They made electronics made of silicon carbide and they tested it. At first, it was work but it only last for onw week. Now, they are looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. This devices doesn't electronics it was faster, faster, and flexible. This deviced were used in the 1800s to 1940s during World War ll. Sometime, when it is very hot other mental things are meling but this devices can ne made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

Finally, the author suggests taht studing Venus is a wothry persuit despite the dangers it presents. I also think that it was worth to study even it is dangerous because this is so fanastining and very intersecting. Venus is very similar to earth and it will be very cool if we could learn about it. In the reading says"" Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" It means that there are many other things in other planet no matter how dangerous it is we should be seek to it. The author talk more about positive than negative about Venus. Even when the author is talking about bad things but they always end in nice way.

In conclution, Venus was very similar to Earth. Scienctist tried to study Venus for a long time but they could not sucesses because they are lack of devices and the author suggests that studying Venus is worth pursuit despite the dangers it presents. They have tried several time but they coud not sucesses. I hope that that they will be sucesses this time and if they are sucesses it will give us a lot of knowledege. We already been to Moon so I think they will find out how to get onto Venus. Even if they can not achieve in this generation. I think they will be achieve in the nect generation because technology kept improving each day.        ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
30E611671A72,"Have you ever wondered about space travel? Maybe even on planets that might be closer than it seems? What if it was one of them in The Milkyway Galaxy? You might be thinking about Mars but you may think too yourself ""We've already explored alot of Mars."" But what if I told you that Venus is the planet we are talking about visting? The author in the article, "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" agrees with exploring one of our planetary neighbors Venus. It's conciderd Earth's 'twin', We have tecnology that can help us explore the planet, and that studying Venuses atmosphere atmosphere can help us lern more abut our sister planet.

Venus is known for being one of Earth's ""twins"". Venus is known for it's density and size that is quite similar to Earth's. ""Astronomers are facinatedby Venus beacuse it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans and could have supported forms of life, just like Earth."" (Paragraph 4, Challenges of Exploring Venus). Astromomers are saying that venus is very similar to Earth, by its size and that in the past Venus might have had life forms on it and that might be a good reason why it would be a good reason to explore Venus.

Another reason why exploring Venus would be a good idea is that we have the proper tecnology to go and explore our sister planet. ""NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to go study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientist to float above the fray... blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the rolling Venusian landscape."" (Paragraph Five, The Challenge of Exploring Venus). With the tecnology to be able to fly over Venus and using a blimp to help humans fly over the harsh conditions of Venuses surface. So we have the right tecnology to fly over Venus and safely get humans from Earth to our sister planet Is another reason why we should start exploring Venus.

A final reason why we should explore Venus is that we know about Venuses weather and condisons are harsh and we know how to help explore the planet. "" a thick atmosphere of almost 97% carbon dioxide and clouds are highly containing sulfuric acid... Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like errupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting stricks to probes seeking land on it's surface."" ( Paragraph 3, The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Scinetist are discovering Venuses waether like conditions and the planet's conditions. With knowing these we can make tecmology that can help us explore the planet. And we can study these weather conditions and learn more about our sister planet.

So traveling to Venus is a good idea to travel to Venus even though the conditions on the planet are not so welcoming and the resaoning for traveling there is that, the planet is Earth's ""twin, we have the correct tecnology to travel there and we know a lot of the planet's atmosphere and how we can take that to help make human travel safe to get from Earth to venusand how we can help humans survive the conditions that come along with Venus. Traveling to venus would also futher our minds on how our neghboring planets are. Do you think that traveling to Venus would help humanity as a whole?     ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
2B46876E1BED,"Venus the ""Evening Star"" would be a worthy pursuit to study despite the many risks and challenges that come along. Venus has insights just waiting to be discovered, observed and samples to bring from the Earth. Exploring Venus does have it's challenges but should in fact limit us to explore the planet.

Humans exploring Venus should not be stopped by the challenges that our sister planet throws at us. The reason for this is because NASA is looking at how humans or Astronauts can stay on the planet without perishing to the harshest conditions Venus has. Instead, Nasa wants humans/astronauts to stay on the planet's atmosphere where it is the least hostile conditions the planet has to offer. In the article, paragraph 5 it states,""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jets airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."" Furthermore in the paragraph you would find that the atronauts will recieve Solar power. Another obstacle that was a problem in order how to get fuel.""Solar power would be plentiful..."" A solution like this helps the idea that exploring Venus to study will not stop human curiosity.

Another challenge that NASA has to find a solution for is what materals and technology to send to Venus for the astronauts to use. The temperature for the humans that will visit Venus will have to live in tempertures of 170 degrees Fahrenheit. This is a problem for common metals that are in mordern day technology. The atmosphere of the planet would melt the metals that there composed of. Instead, they working on how to change the materials of the tech they want ot be along side them to the planet of Venus. NASA has simplified electronics devices and gadgetsout of silicon carbide. This can be found in paragraph 7 and states, "" For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" Another solution that NASA has come up with was the idea of using old technology that has to be used mechanically. Such devices from the 1800's and used frequently in World War II. These are used by levers and gears that make calculations and do not require electronics at all. This information can also be found in paragraph 7. It states,"" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II. The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking ,but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" This is NASA's other soltuion to record the studies and findings found on Venus.

In conclusion, Venus has many obstacles and dangers. However, this shouldn't stop us to explore the face of the planet and disocver more what the planet lies beneath the dark envious clouds it has. Venus is worth studying and despite the dangers it presents, human curiosity will only allow us to futhermore find solutions to the planets obstacles they have waiting for us.

FC66DF75DFDE,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus

Imagine living on a dangerous but not so dangerous planet, would you risk your life on the sake of science? Venus could be a groundbreaking science exploration but is dangerous. The author makes claims suggesting Venus is dangerous but it is worth it. ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"". Which I agree with the author.

The author talks about how ""no spaceship has landed there in three decades"" but,""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". The fact that Venus could've had life could help us find out if other life forms live within us, that seems worthy enough. Although the temperatures do average over 800 degrees fahrenheit scientists can float above the fray. The temperature can get at 170 degrees which is survivable for us humans. ""Erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"". Weather conditions may be dangerous but humans will not land on its surface.

The ""atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than we face on our own planet"". Like I said they won't send their astronaunts onto the surface but they will be sent on the fray and will be more secure on the fray. ""Not one spacecraft last a few hours"". As the years go up our technology gets more sufficient and becomes safer, so scientists will be able to make a spacecraft that is able to land on Venus. ""The clouds have highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere"", astronaunts and scientists will stay on the fray.

I added seven different dangerous facts about venus and all of them were answered by scientists suggesting that Venus is safe for astronaunts to go. I stand with the author which is Venus is dangerous but it is a worthy pursuit. Letting astronaunts goto Venus would be groundbreaking and yes it is safe for astroanaunts to goto.

5E7CEEE574E4,"The challenge of exploring Venus showed a great amount of evidence to support both opinions, supportive of the idea or not. As we lnow venus is 170 degrees on the surface but ships can take it. Then theres the fact that no spacecrafts sent by humans has ever lasted more than a few hours on the surface of venus.

there is a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets on venus, and even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmospher.

Venus distance wise is a time consuming yet possible feet. Venus and mars are the closest neighboring plants to us and Venus more than mars shows there could have been life long ago on this planet. Venus consists of valleys, mountian ranges, craters , and many believe oceans once inhabited this planet. Talks of NASA doing a human ran investigation thirty miles aboves venus to do reaserch.

NASA belives that Venus has not easy condistions but survivable for humans. There has been talks of even sending people down there to do research in the future and that could go bad knowing the knowledge you have on this planet. the challenges would be very intimidating and unpredictable.

In the end these talks on further exploring Venus is very intresting and inthink is should be done at the right place and the right time.

EBE9A518B40A,"Interplanetary exploration is a modern day project that scientists are making quick progress on. Scientists are fed up with staying on Earth and the natural human instinct for craving new knowledge drives them to explore where no man has gone before. Scientists have tried numerous times to study Earth's sister planet, Venus, but have failed and coming back with no new knowledge about the planet. With recent ideas and new innovations, scientists have carefully and thoroughly thought about every possible danger and how to counteract it. This might cause the possibility of sending humans to Venus.

One of the main reasons we could explore Venus, is that it is refferred to as Earth's twin for many reasons. Venus is roughly the same size and density of Earth. With Venus's orbit in relation to Earth, Venus is often our closest planetary neighbor. Venus also boasts many similiarities that Earth has. Venus has numerous mountains, valleys, and craters, just like Earth. Also, Earth grew and supported many forms of life with the existence of water and oceans. Scientists have found evidence of water being found on Venus's surface which is a good sign. Both planets also contain clouds over their landscape. But Venus's clouds are much different to Earth's clouds, containing sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide, poisonous to humans.

This challenge has driven scientists for years to come up with new or use existing products to be able to study Venus. The atmosphere of Venus has proven to be very hazardous to metal, melting tin and other metals within hours. scientists have come up with a new metal called silicon carbide, which has pproven to last upo to three weeks in Venus's conditons. But this is not all scientists have come up with though, using mechanical computers, they are able to do many calculations that are very difficult for humans to do on their own. These computers were used in World War II using no electronics, but rather a series of gears and levers to do what they needed to do. This has proven that scientists are capable of overcoming even the most challenging of tasks. Using this new and old technology, they are trying to come up with machines or instruments to be able to study the ground from their new aircraft.

With the harsh conditions of Venus's ground and atmosphere, scientists are not able to get a machine to land on the surface of the planet without it breaking or melting, causing them to think of another approach to study Venus. With the idea of how jet passenger planes fly over storms to avoid danger, they took that concept to Venus and will try to create an aircraft that will hover or fly thirty miles above the surface to avoid the danger of Venus's clouds. Flying at an altitude of thirty miles will replicate many condtions found on earth, such as the sea level atmospheric pressure, Earth's radiations, and wind speeds. This will increase the safety of these missions by a substantial amount. These new concept will aid in the exploration of new planets.

Scientists are humans that have a natural crave for new knowledge. We have tried interplanetary exploration for numerous years, but with little ot no success. But with modern day technology and ideas of the past, we have come up with ways to overcome challenges often brought with space navigation. We have come up with silicon carbide, a material capable of overcoming the conditions brought Venus's atmosphere. Venus is Earth's twin, boasting many similiarities between the two. With science quickly progressing with no end in sight, we will inevitably go to another planet, whether nature tries to stop us or not.

We will improvise, adapt, and overcome many challenges brought with space navigation. ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
89E8673AC25E,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author explains that studying Venus is a worthy approach despite the dangers. The author impressively supports that the mission to Venus is worth it despite the dangers that might come with it. In the article he provides examples, uses a credible source, and also views the other side. By doing these things it made his point credible and also stronger to the reader.

In the article he provides the example of a floating car above venus to show that a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the conditions but it would provide little sight. He uses to example to illustrate what it would be like to avoid the conditionsby showing this is what the would have to do. He also provides examples to an alternative by saying that there could be electronics to avoid the risks. By providing both of these examples it gives the reader some relateable examples to get an insight into his point.

NASA is a world wide administration that has credibility over the course of its govern. By providing examples of what NASA is doing to show that it should be done, then if NASA is working on it then it makes his point credible. He quotes NASA'S approches on studying Venus so that it can avoid the risks to show that it is possible to explore Venus without the risks. A NASA solution would be that a person could float above the fray. They also have considered sending electronices so it is possible. He saying that it might be difficult but it is attainable. This supports the claim that he supports his claim impresively because he uses sources.

In most arguments the person views the other side so that they can provide an alternative to what they are saying. He uses cons such as no mission has had a man, 97% of carbon dioxide blankets Venus, the temperature is 90 times greater than Earth, and that it could crash a submarine. But then he says that Venus has benefits to that out way the dangers. The benfits include: it is the brightest point, it is close to Earth compared to other space travels, long ago it could support life, and it will expand the edges of imagination and innovation. He provides benefits to out weigh the cons of exploring Venus. He does a great job of explaining why exploring Venus has value and can provides insight to other counter arguments that might rise from others opionions. This is why he does an impressive job supporting his argument.

FF35257B6394,"The author did a great job supporting his/her previous statements. The author used many examples and real facts to back up the explanation of why we should keep studying and trying to get to Venus. Venus is a complicated planet, with many features that are not imaginable. Although we haven't made many big discoveries about Venus itself, we will still continue to learn, look at, and love everything about it.

The author stated that Venus is extremely dangerous do to the crazy temperatures, radioactivity, and absurdly high atmospheric pressures. ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus 3). This quote represents everything previously stated. It speaks of the high temperatures and the atmospheric pressure on Venus' surface and atmosphere. ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun""(The Challenge of Exploring Venus).

This quote shows another fact that'll help back up other statements. It talks about how Venus actually has the hottest surface in our solar system.

In concluson, Venus should continue to be studied and should be understood by everyone. After reading this passage, it's hard not to see the beauty of life.

I'm not just saying this because of my interest, but also because if it's so similar to Eath than let's study it more. They referr Venus as Earth's twin so let's see what makes it it's twin. The passage adds than the atmosphere is different in Venus and we would need to be preapred for that.

Going and exploring Venus is a risk but sometimes we just have to go in and take that risk. Life is all about taking risks and going for it. We never know what new studies we could find in Venus. Personally I would like to know how Venus has similar feature like Earth but has a totally different atmosphere. It also has earthquackes, volcanoes, and lighting strikes just liek Earth.

I like the idea NASA had that we should send humans to study Venus. For this to happen we would need to have them float above the surface. We wouldn't know if it's safe for them to land on Venus's surface jus yet. The conditions would be the extreme temperature and more. But these conditions are survivable for humans.

After reading this passage, we could go study Venus a bit more. They talked about the conditions it would have and, what would we need to do so it can happen.

Venus is alot like earth or it was a few years ago. Venus has water on it and if theres water there also could be life. Any spacecraft we have sent up to it hasnt last very long only a few hours so really dont know whats up there. NASA is creating insane technology.

First, venus is alot like how earth was at first alot of water and rocky but no trees or nature at the moment. We know for sure there is water and rocky mountains. It is also pretty hot there since its the secound planet from the sun. so life could be possible on that planet. Venus is also almost the same size as earth so they have alot of things in common.

Second, NASA has sent alot of spacecrafts up there to explore more and to find out more about the planet and to see if it is safe to land on the planet. All the spacecrafts only last for about a few hours and some dont even make it. Some just dont work after they land. That is why NASA has not landed up there yet. Its because they dont know all the dangers that could be up there. So for inorder for them to land up there they would need more information about the planet.

Third , NASA is making technology that is insane and could last in really bad conditions. They have made some of these drones with cameras just for venus. They have tested these drones in really bad condidtions just like venus. Those drones have lasted for full three weeks without any problems. So now they would probably send those to venus to explore the planet and see whats going up there. They would learn more about the planet before they land there themselfs.

Finally, venus is alot like earth because they have almost the same size and both have water and rocky mountains. NASA has sent alot of spacecraft to venus which isnt lasting more than a few hours. NASA is now making insane drones which would last about three weeks at Venus. So they would defintly find out if there is any danger up there.

It is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. There could have been life on Venus at one point. Venus has been difficult to study according to NASA. In the essay it is stated that ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system."" Due to this there is erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes.

Venus is Earth's sister-planet and scientists have speculated it to one have been the most "" Earth-like planet in our solar system.""

Venus has valleys, mountains and craters, the same as Earth does.

The atmosphere of Venus and the planet itself is difficult to examine. Venus' atmosphere is estimated to be coated with 97% of carbon dioxide. The clouds are made up of highly corrosive sulfuric acid. On the surface of Venus, its temperature could average over 800 degress farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is sometimes 90 times greater that what it is on Earth.

NASA has an idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's solution to the violent conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above it. A vehicle that is basically a blimp, hovering 30 miles or greater above Venus' landscape. NASA's idea for the ""blimp"" could possibly be a breakthrough because the ""blimp"" would be able to avoid the harsh conditions that is going on below. Although the vehicle would be above the surface, the temperature would still be 170 degrees farenheit.

The author supports the idea that pursuing Venus is worthy.

NASA's solutions to the violent conditions could help get different types of samples. Earths sister-planet could possibly be sustaining life. Despite its dangers it is important to study Venus. NASA exploring the planet from surface or above would still be a breakthrough.    ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
FB3850CF775C,"The author states that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The first reason that supports this idea is by stating that Venus has caught the attention of astronomers because it was once a planet like earth. Second, another reason that supports this idea is NASA wants to have a better insight of the ground conditions of Venus and studying them better. The third reason is NASA has been trying to invent a way for humans or technology to survivethe conditions in Venus and studying Venus more without risking anyones life.

The first reason that supports the idea that studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers it presents is the author states that Venus has caught the attention of many astronomers because long ago Venus was a planet like earh. Venus ""was covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"" stating that Venus was a planet that had lots of different forms of life and that astronomers are amazed and are wanting to discover more about Venus."" Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,"" this quote states that Venus is the planet that can be the nearest to us and that it would benefit NASA a lot because although this planet is pretty dangerous to be in it would help NASA learn and discover things about Venus and how to be there without risking their lifes.

The second reason that supports this idea is NASA wants to have a better insight on ground conditions and studying them better. "" More imporantly, reseachers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to undersatnd Venus..."" this quote states that NASA has realized that they can't get simples of any kind of living life in Venus that could help invent a way to be there without risking anyones life therefore they haven't invented the technology to do that but they are working on it althought they know there are risks. ""Many researchers are working on innovations that could allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"" the quote here states again that researchers are working on finding technolgy that will allow their machines to last longer in Venus so that they can see and study for themselves Venus but are they are also cautions that sending those machines could maybe not work.

The thrid reason that supports this idea is NASA is taking different approaches to studying and learning aboust Venus. "" Some simplifed electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested ina chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions,""

the quote here states that NASA is coming up with new inventions to study Venus without taking the risk of going actually there. Its also states that they had invented a kind of electronic that will last there up to three weeks in Venus. ""Another project is loking back to an old technology called mechanical computers,"" the quotes states that NASA is looking back to technology that was used during world war 2 could be useful for studying Venus.

In concludsion the author supports the idea that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers real well by giving examples. Even though there are many risks into going to Venus there is many reasons why to take those risks. Astronmers could study more about Venus and its similarites to earth. It would help NASA discover new forms of life. It would benefit NASA by studying more about the ground conditions in Venus. It would help NASA work on taking different approaches to studying Venus. Instead of just sending a person to Venus and risking their life NASA will have technology that will be able to resist the conditions of Venus and be better prepared.

""The Callenge of Exploring Venus"" gives plenty reasons that could result in safe ways to explore this planet resulting in a big enough reason to further reasearching the planet.

Venus is alike Earth in many ways. The author states that, ""...it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Venus had oceans, rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters. Researching this planet and getting information on this planet in very important because it will lead to many other things to explore in the future.

If scientists are going to get hands on studying, there has to be a safe way to conduct a trip to the planet. There are many ways that NASA could get humans there safely. The author says a possible soulution would be getting a float to hover over Venus to observe the atmosphere and get photgraphs and videos. Because the extreme conditions of high heat an pressure have to be counted in on this, the float would make the conditions survivable.

The author also adds that getting mechanical computers could also help in researching Venus. ""These decvices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II."" The device that the author is talking about could help because they are flexible to pressure, heat, and other forces that would be placed when on Venus.

The author adding evidence that shows there could be ways to get around the conditions means that there is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers the planet presents. In paragraph 8, the text says, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts bust should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.""

The author suggests that studying venus is a great chance to learn and find new things and supports alot of theses claims by giveing some great support on why its a good idea. The author starts by explaning that venus is referrd to as Earh's twin in maney cases cause its the closest planet to the Earth in terms of density and size. Venus also nickednamed the ""Evening Star"" is one of the planets closest to the Earth in distance as also Mars is in that distance aswell. All three planets are around and orbit the sun at different speeds says the author in paragraph 2.""Often referred to as Earth's twin Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closet in the distnace too"". ""Earth,Venus,Mars,our planetary negihbor,orbit the sun at different speeds"". The author starts giving his part on why we should study and travel venus by saying its the planet the may have once been the most Earth like planet in the solar system long ago and was probbley covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like how earth is today. Venus still has some known features that still resemble Earth today like the planet haveing a rocky sediment and includs things such as valleys,moutains,craters. Altho Venus does seem nice its very dangerous to travel there and is not safe for humans at the moment. Scientest have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on Venus but no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Venus also has a thick atomosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that sarounds Venus. The even more challeging thing is the clouds that are highly corrosive of sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere and the fact that the planets surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit makeing these far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth as said by the author in paragraph 3""a thick amtosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dixiode blankets Venus"".""Even more challeing are the clouds of highely corrosive sulfuric acid in venu,s atomsphere"". Traveling to venus seems too dangerous but the author gives some ideas on how we can possably make traveling to Venus safer. One of these ideas come from The National Aeronautics and Space Adinistration also known as (NASA).This idea is for sending humans to study Venus NASA,s soluiton to the harsh Venus conditions of its surface is to make a blimp like vehicle that would hover 30 or so miles above the planet. This would allow scientists to avoid the unfirendly ground conditions of Venus and with the only minor problem being the air would still be a little hot at 170 degrees Fahrenheit but the air pressure being close to Earth at sea level. This is one of the maney ideas on how to vist the planet Venus and its values says the author.""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value,not only because of the insigt to be gaind on the planet itself,but also beacause human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"".",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
617A0D8E9E9F,"There are many questions still to be answered about Venus. Was it really once a survivable atmosphere for life? Could there have been life on Venus at one point in time? Were there any plant or food sources?

Venus is Earth's twin planet due to it's similarity in size and density, making it probable that Venus was once very similar to our planet and living conditions. It shouldn't be a suprise it is desired to be explored and researched.

Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system, besides it not being closest to the sun, Venus's average temperature is an average of 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Which leaves Venus being an Astronomic mystery. Even the atmospheric pressure is 90x greater than anything on earth,including the bottom of our oceans.

NASA has yet to discover a productive way to visit the planet. One idea being to hover atleast 30 miles over the landscape of Venus. A con to that is NASA's technology can not handle samples of gas or rocks due to the atmospheric pressure.

NASA is still working on ideas, a plan and the right technology to take a look at Venus which in the end, will be a magnificent discovery.

Taking a closer look at Venus could likely lead us to discovering something great in astromonmy and could likely help us answer some of the biggest questions of our Solar System.

Besides the dangers and great challenges, a history changing discovery could be made and is worth the risks.   ",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
6DBF611124E6,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus, is a very detailed, reliable article. It seems as though the author thinks it would be a good idea to find a way to have an exploration take place on our neighboring planet, Venus. In the authors final paragraph they state that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" wich strongly indicates that the author thinks it would be good to invest in such an exploration. For the most part the author supports his idea well but there are some parts of this article that could possibly make some readers confused.

In most of the paragraphs of this exerpt the author is stating the danger that is involved in making an exploration to Venus. As much as the author states towards the beggining and end of the article how they beleive it would be a worthy pursuit, for most of the body paragraphs they dont seem too optimistic about the exploration. For example in paragraph 2 the author says that Venus is,""a challenging planet for humans to study "". Another example from paragraph 4,""The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive?"". These types of remarks seem slightly reoccuring in this exerpt. They also show that the author seems like they have alot of doubt in NASA's capability to continue with such a major journey.

The writer of this article was very knowledgable about the terms and conditions of mars,and what it would take to be able to do research on the planet itself. The majority of this exerpt consists of diffrences and similarities that venus and our home planet, Earth, have. For example in paragraph 2 the author exclaims that the two planets are referred to as ""twins"". An example of how they were contrasted, in paragraph 3,""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" As you can see, the detailed facts in this exerpt are clearly reliable.

As much as it may be controversial, because the author did show alot of negative effects to exploring Venus, they did bring up some reasons how it could be a good idea to make an exploration like this, considering how alot Venus and Earth are. For example in paragraph 4, the author states,""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.""""Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" These examples show that the author is guving strong reason why it would be possible to make a expidition to Venus.

The article, The Challenge of Exploring Venus, is very detailed, factual, and strong. Although it may not 100% express that the author is trying to say it would be a worthy pursuit to make an expedition to Venus, this article still would give people alot of information on Venus and reasons why we should or should not go there. This exerpt does express that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, for the most part. It may show more of the dangers and not as much why it would be worthy, but at some parts it does show that it would be a good idea.

Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because it may well once been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system. In paragraph 4 it says ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familar features such as valleys, mountains,and craters."" There is even a posibility that Venus was largely covered with oceans and could have supported various form of life just like Earth. Venus can be a possibility of Earth travels. The dangers of Venus is the 97% carbon dioxide on the planet. In paragraph 3 it says "" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" Venus atmosphere is more dangerous than ours, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience in our on planet. Can Venus be a planet we live on?

To get an understandment of Venus NASA need to get close and personal despite the risk.

There are some dangers and risk factors that come along in the travel.

The author does include a lot of risk factors but also a lot of benifits.

I'm suppose to evaluate and give my input of how well the author explained this topic.

The author comes out saying how Earth and Venus are so similar and shape and density and how close it is from us.

I like how the author included this so you have an idea of how far it is and that one day it could be accomplished.

The author talks about unmanned space crafts and how each time they went to venus they would only last a few hours.

I think he includes this because some readers get in image how dangerous of a travel it is.

The author goes into detail about the factors the contribute of how dangerous venus is.

The text says

''A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.'' and ''On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmosphric pressure is 90 times greater than ehat we experience on our own planet.''

The author goes into detail of why we need to explore such a dangerous place.

The text says ''Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.

Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life.''

I like how the author said how Earth was like Venus so people get an idea of how that they are similar in surface.

The author includes of how NASA is trying to get people to Venus.

The text says ''NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.''

I like how the author includes that a big company is trying to change the way of space travel.

The author wraps the text up by how the goal is not unrealistic and how people need to work hard to accomplish these goals.

The text says ''Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of insight to be ganied on the planet itself, but also becuase human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.''           ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

Living on the surface of Venus would be impossible but like the author states, living 30 miles abpve the surface might not be so bad. It would e the only option if we want to live on Venus but theres a pretty good chance it could work.

One thing the author does very well is that the author does a good job of supporting the the idea of studying Venus even though its a very dangerous planet. He stronlgy suggest to study Venus ans eventually get us to live there. Paragraph 4 says ""If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing further visits to its surface? Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This shows that even though Venus is very dangerous, scientists still love Venus and really want to learn more to eventually getting to live there above the clouds. And it proves that the author of the article was right about pushing to study Venus becasue thats exactly what the scientists think.

Another way the author does a good idea of supporting how Venus should be studied more is by explaining how NASA wants to send people to Venus to study it more and to continure to learn about Venus. Paragraph 5 says ""(NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus. NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape.......At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth zlevels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author proves how humans could stay on venus to learn more about it and study it way more. The author proves that living abouve the surface and clouds would be way easier for humans to do because the surface is too harsh.

In conclusion, the author did a very good job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

But what makes dangers of traveling there worth what could be found? Is this topic done justice from by the author?

What would make the danger of going to Venus worth it?

Information the trip to Venus could provide is very usesfull. As we know so far this is the most similar planet to Earth spite the extreme temperatures; this planet has a surface of rocky sediment and has similar features such as valleys, mountains and also craters. Some of the differences it has include, different atmosphere makeup. Also, unbareable pressure and much more.

Risks that comes with the trip includes extreme heat, dense atmosphere, very high atmospherical presure and much more dangers. To prevent this the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one idea that might work. Creating a blimp-like vehicle that is capable of hovering over 30 or so miles above the landscape, just like the aircrafts we have on Earth. As temperatures will still be some what of an issue, by their calculations, being about 30 miles away will reduce temperatures down to 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The distance will also reduce pressure down similar to Earth's sea level so it will not be crushed instantly. These conditions are not easy on us humans but, is still survivable.

Hovering over the landscape creates an issue to scientist. That being they can not recieve any actual samples from the ground to test. That meaning they need a way to do so without creating more risk. This is where systems that use mechanical parts instead relying electronics come into play. This is because with the 800 degree temperature the surface of Venus provides, even though electronis are fast, flexible and quick they are more delicate in general. This leaves them at a dissadvantage with the harsh climate. As mechanical part systems can be made to resist more pressure, heat and other forces.

Venus have many and multiple things that are similar to earth for instance venus have rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters. I think the author have a good reason to keep studying venus it is earth like with all the similar features besided from the high carbon dioxide and extreme storms and weather temperatures.

Humans have sent numerouse spacecraft to land on venus but none have survived for more than a few hours. Every since then not a single spacecraft have touched down on venus since more than three decades. Venus have a thick atmosphere of almost ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide. Venus temperatures is really extreme the temperature average eight hundred degrees on a regular. The pressure and atmosphere is ninety times greater then earth's atmosphere.

Venus has the hottest temperature of any planet in our solar system even though mercury is closest to the sun. This reason being is because of the weather conditions venus have erupting like valcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes that hits the surface. These conditions are far extreme then anything on earth. The conditions on venus could crush a submarine accustomed for diving to the deepest parts of our ocean. But still NASA is trying to figure out a way to send scientist to venus so they can study the palnet more.

Scientist say that venus could have been covered in with largely oceans and had life forms on its planet similar to earth. they say this because venus still have some features that are analogous to thoes on earth. They say that sometimes venus can be our nearest option for a planetary visit. Scientist is making a blimp like craft so that can float thirty miles above venus to study it better. Scientist wants to find out how much venus is like earth and trying to see if it csn somehow be habital in them extreme conditions.

The only problem with everything thats going is that being above and studing the planet give you limited insight on the ground to see whats going on. More importantly researchers cannot researchsample of rock, gas or anything else from that distance in the air. NASA is making electronic",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
B8757E80EB9D,"Venus can be a scary planet when it comes down to its features. The writer to this story certanly convinced me that we should not study Venus anymore. We have tried to land spacecraft on the planet before, but none have last no more than a few hours, so how are we supposed to study it when it just keeps destroying our spacecrafts. We haven't tried it again in a decade. The reason to this is that Temperatures vary around 800 degrees fahrenheit. Venus has a thick atmosphere of 97% carbon dioxide. If us humans even take a step on Venus we get crushed. Venus has a 90% atomic pressure, which is greater than what we have on Earth. It could even crush a submarine and those are supposed to outstand pressure from the ocean. Venus isn't a very pretty planet either, it has a familiar features as valleys,mountains, and craters. We could use spacecraft to hover over venus about 30 miles or so above it. Even if we did that we couldn't take sample rocks or gas. Are technology gets better throughout the years, so maybe one day well figure a way out to oustand that heat and pressure. Even if we do that though, what would be the sense if we cant even live on the planet. Half of the stuff we use today will never outstand the heat or pressure that Venus has. Including phones,cars,and houses. This shows you that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4

The author also claim that Venus is Earth's ""twin"" making it closest to visit.

The author claim that scientists are so fascinated by Venus becuase it was it well have been the most Earth-like plant in our system. The author says that long ago Venus could've been cover with oceans and might have even support various forms of life. The author suggest that there are familiar feature on Venus to Earth right now such as: rocky surface, valleys, mountains, and crator. However, the author also stated that Venus conditions are far more extreme than anything humans can encounter on Earth.

The author also claim that Venus would be a good place to vist because of how close Venus is to Earth. Venus is call Earth ""twin"" along with Mars because of how close they are to each other. The author claim that this would be a good option for a planetary visit, given the crucial consideratin of the long time frames of space travel. Even though the average temperatures is to extreme, NASA are working to a solutuion to study Venus by humans.

In conclusion, the author suggest to visit Venus because Venus could very well have been the most Earth-like planet and because of how close Venus is to Earth. The author is driven with curiosity to gain an insight on Venus. The author consider the possiblelity of visiting Venus both safe and productive. Visting beyond should not be limited by dangers and doughts.     ",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
DCE29551F875,"In the article,""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author suggests that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. In certain cases the author is right about his idea, but in other cases it might get to risky for humans. Venus is the closest planet to earth, but is serverly hot. ""While Venus is to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely"". The closer humans get to Venus, the less likely they are to survive. People may say it, ""is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot"", even with his being a true statement, Venus is still a very hot and dangerous planet to visit.

Some humans may disagree and agree with the authors idea, they may agree because Venus is a planet to explore not to just see photos. Humans say also disagree with the authors idea because it is dangerous and there has never benn a spaceship actually make it to Venus. ""Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"". If you think it about it though the authors idea is a well thought out idea. Even though there are factors that would lead to danger, bu they also lead to satifactory like, ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system"". Even though Venus is very hot, there are ways to keep human safe to at least get to slightly see it or expierence it without it getting too dangerous.

Other than it being hot on the planet Venus, there are very fasinating things on Venus. Forexample, ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" These are beautiful minerals to experience that you don't see on Earth. On the other hand, ""More importantly, reasearchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distnace."" Instead of listening to that, scientist are like the author they believe it is right to study Venus despite the risks, so scientist went to get up close and personal despite th risks to see the rocks and other things.

An exciting thing that NASA is working on is, working on other approaches to studying Venus. ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" They are also looking into old technology, machanical computers. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions. Just imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin. Don't let all that fool you though, because some systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant pressure, heat, and other forces.

With all of this information adn facts about how studying Venus is worthy pursuit sepite the dangers it presents, the author is stating a good idea. Reasons so that being is there are fasinating minerals, being able to expierence it just a little bit over Venus, and NASA's idea of going back to old technology to help study Venus a different way. ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Letting humans make the decision to go to Venus is their choice, but it may be worth the dangers to be able to expierence a new planet.   ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
F4A576AD01D8,"Despite how many set backs people have had with trying to land rovers and other machines on Venus, people are still trying to find a way to gain further knowledge about the planet. With the temperature being set at 800 degrees Fahrenheit, that could be enough alone for human do die. That would be like going into a fire. Even if they managed to build something to with stand higher heat, the atmosphere is made up of 97% carbon dioxide. The planet is practically burning causing carbon dioxide to blanket the whole planet. The atmosphere still stands at a 170 degree temperature. High enough temperature can metal some metals and most materials or burn them.

The author of this article is obviously drawn to exploring Venus to get a better understanding of it. In the last paragraph it is said that ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" The authoer is just saying that no matter how big the danger is, even if it is risky, we shouldn't be set back by it. Sometimes, somethings are better left unexplored because it could have risks that people don't even know of. If they are somehow able to make a machine that is able to withstand the harsh climate of Venus, they will want to send a person up there one day won't they? But I human most likely will never be able to withstand those conditions even if they were in a machine that protected them. Heat causes things to expand which can eventually expand the metal enough and expose that person to heat and carbon dioxide.

In conclusion, despite how many times people have tried to land rovers and machines on Venus, they will one day find a way to perfect those machines and may be able to send a person up there to gather further research on the planet.",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
AFD9DAA96F07,"In this article the author tells us about Venus. He tells us that it is called the ¨Evening Star¨, that it is known as Earths ¨twin¨, and then he explains the attempts made to study and learn more about the planet. He also explains how those attempts were unsucsessful and that the planet is dangerous. But, despite the dangers he has presented to us, he explains that it is worth the danger. I dont personaly believe he did the best job explaining why he believed so and he definitly did not convince me to think the same.

The author never truely explained his claim that he thought exploring Venus was worth the risks and complications. For most of the artical he rambles on telling us about and explaining what was already found out about the planet. He never gave reasoning for believing we sould follow threw with trying to learn more about the planet. He only breifly told us his claim in the last paragraph, paragraph 8. It reads, ¨Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.¨ He tells us that all we will get from risking our lifes is insite on a dangerous planet that we may not even have use for, and he states that we will be faced with more and or equally intimidating endeavors. It may just be my opinion but that does not seem like very convincing or valid reasons for putting lifes in danger.

I truely believe that the author of the artical, ¨The challenge of Exploring Venus¨ did not support his claim and what he believed very well let alone at all. All he gives us is two reasons that are not very valid and did not back them up or tell us why those reasons make a good point and sould make us think the same way. He did not tell us why we needed the information so badly that we should risk our lifes or even make the effort. I do not belive the author supported the idea or really stated his claim or what he belived. He needs more reasoning and explaining of what we would gain from this and how it would benifit us.

D8210CC30678,"In ""The challenge of Exploring Venus"", we are faced with another difficult task. We have had many hard task in our past space wise, from our first step on the moon, to the discovery of Pluto being a dwarf planet. Studying Venus closely is a worthy pursuit because, it's a challenge and who doesn't like a challenge, it would be a exploration many people from generations old and new would like rake on themselves, and possibly we could find a way to live on a planet other than Earth.

Exploring Venus is going to be extremely challenging. For example, the passage says ""Venus has the hottest surfqace temperature of any planet in our solar system."" This place is going to to be extremely hard to get close to because of the heat. We can't even take pictures because ""most forms of light cannot penetrate the atmosphere."" Our most high-tech cameras can't even get a decent picture of the surface of Venus.

Many people from the new and old generation are obbssed with space and everything to do with it. Our workers at NASA have created electronics that have been designed to last on Venus and they have survived weels in the harsh terrain. NASA is constantly discovering something new about space. They are even using designs from the past like our ""mechnical computers."" They are using the design of mechanical computers because the are very durabole under harsh conditions, which is what we're gonna need in order to explore Venus.

The planet Venus is very much like Earth. There are so many energy resources there. ""Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."" That is great because if we lived on Venus we wouldn't have to worry about pollutting the planets as quickly as we have done on Earth. Also, we would be able to spread the electricity widely throughout the palnet.

In conclusion, exploring Venus would be a worthy pursuit for many reasons. We are going to get there one day with the way our space administrations are working. There is so much we don't know about the planets in our solar system, even our own planet. We should take the opportunity to explore whatever we can as soon as we can.

BA908A399CEB,"Exploring Venus clearly has it's challenges. The exploration of an unknown area always has benefits with the information that can be uncovered, but it is almost never easy. Planets in general all hold many barriers for studying done by scientists and researchers. The author of this article suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by proving that Venus may have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, and that Venus is the nearest option for a planetary visit. The author also claims that The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a solution to make visiting Venus safer.

First of all, the author says that Venus may have once been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. In the text, it says, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" Venus is or once was clearly somewhat similar to Earth, and that will help scientists to be able to find out information about our own planet along with another planet that may seem the most reasonable to study. In the text, it also says,""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probabnly covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" All of these characteristics of Venus make the planet more interesting and reasonable for studying. Considering the fact that the planet is very similar to Earth, the planet may also give us insight of our own planet, with the similarities that can and have already been drawn.

Secondly, Venus is the nearest option for a planetary visit. In the text, it says, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."" This clearly proves that studying Venus is worth the pursuit because it is not going to take as long as other planets will to get to. Traveling in space, as the author said, can take a very long time, and that makes Venus a lot more accessible than most other planets. Studying Venus cuts down a major barrier that scientists and astronomers would have to work around for many other planets, and that is time.

Lastly, NASA has a solution to make studying Venus safe. In the text, it says, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray...At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" NASA's solution solves many problems with studying Venus. The many factors like air pressure, heat, and radiation are lowered to survivable numbers for humans. Without this solution from NASA, the conditions of Venus are not survivable for a time period long enough to actually gain any information about the planet. In the text, it also explains that scientists and researchers would need to get up closer in order to actually gain insight about the planet. Although this is true, NASA is working on other solutions like simplified electronics made of silicon carbide that can last for up to three weeks in the conditions of Venus. All of these solutions can help to make studying Venus less risky and dangerous, and therefore worth the risk.

In conclusion, studying Venus provides a true challenge to scientists, researchers, and more. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" provides evidence to researchers and scientists that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus is or was very similar to Earth. The author also says that Venus is accessible because of it's distance from Earth and the time it would take to reach it. The author also provides NASA's solutions to the dangers of studying Venus.

I have a couple of reasons why it is worthy pursuit and a few reasons why it isn't a worth pursuit, but I will stick to the reaons why it is a worthy pursuit. There are many reasons and challenges of leaving our own planet to go visit and explore another planet, but with the right midset and will power anything is possible.

A couple of reasons why it would be a worthy pursuit to go to Venus is because it could show us what Earth will look like if we keep abusing our planet. The reason I say this is because in paragraph 3 it states that the atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide. This really popped out to me because people on Earth are saying global warming and the main reason of that is carbon dioxide from cars. Another reason this would be a worthy pursuit is that scientist can study the planet with their own eyes. The reason that would bepossible is that because NASA had an idea that we have a blimp like object be about 30 miles or so above the ground and scientist would be able to study what a planet like our own cold end up like.

In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author claims that even thoug it may be dangerous to do, visiting venus is a worthy persuit. The reasons that the author states in the article are: Astronomers are fascinated by the planet, human curiosity, and because NASA is already planning it.

The first reason why the author said that the mission to Venus should be looked at is because astronomers are fascinated by Venus. They are fascinated because they believe that Venus is the closes thing to Earth, not only by distance but also because they are very similar. In paragraph 4 it is stated that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"". So they want to discover and see if Venus still has the Earth like qualities to it.

Furthermore, the other reason the author gave as to why scientists are so interested in persuing the visiting to Venus is because humans are ery curious and because they think that the curiosity will lead to many things. On paragraph 8, the author explains that ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally untimidating endeavors"" meaning that might as well trying it since we are going to try far worse stuff in the future.

Lastly, NASA already is planning to send people to research Venus, of course, they are taking many precautions and they are simulating the things that astronauts might face when they get there or near there. ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow to float abov the fray"" as stated on paragraph 5, it would still be hot but they would be able to handle it.

Dispite those facts scientists are still fascinated by the planet do to it's increadible similarity to Earth, but the conditions have prevented scientists from investigating throughly. With all spacecraft sent to Venus being destroyed it is a suprise that we are still trying to study this planet, and the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" gives very little insight into why scientists are still attempting to study the planet.

To start off Venus is our sister planet with very similar density and size to Earth with similar features with mountains, valleys, and other rocky structures. The author states that many scientists think that Venus could have supported life long ago and may have been covered in ocean and if this is true we may get much insight as to why Venus would change to become an exteremly inhospitable planet. Though the author gives us very little as to what we will be able to do with this information or what other information we may get. The author also mentions space travel but states only that, ""Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit, a crusial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" 4). Other than that small mention the author does not go into depth on this idea.

Though the thought of being able to explore and study one of the closes planets to us is great the author of ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" does not do to good of a job of informing us as to why we would attempt to weather such harsh conditions. With the temperature going over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the pressure that could liquify metal its hard to reason why we should attempt to send probes to Venus let alone travaling there personaly and the author does not do a very good job covincing us that this is a good idea.

The author claims that the planet Venus would be a worthy goal to pursue, despite the dangerous conditions and harmful atmosphere that the planet posseses. The author provides information on possible ways that we could overcome the challenge of landing on the planet Venus, but no clear reason as to why we should pursue this goal besides his own rationalization of a reason provided at the end of the article. Not only is the evidence that the author provides theoretical in the efficiency of the tools stated on another planet, but the purpose of the tools in collecting samples and taking photos is not descibed or elaborated on. Despite the risks, the author has no clear reason for the benefit of landing on Venus, and the tools that the author proposes do not support the idea that it would be possible to land on Venus and actively collect samples or take pictures.

The author claims that the value of returning to Venus ""seems indisputible"" in paragraph 4, but the only reason for this claim is his analogy that Venus is similar in structure to Earth. In paragraph 5, the author states that a possible way to approach the planet seems possible, because NASA had an idea to create ""a blimp-like vehicle to hover over Venus."" The author in paragraph 6 states that the blimp would only allow us to recieve ""limited insight"" on the planet, and we would not be able to take samples or take pictures due to the dense atmosphere. The author does not provide any possible way to collect samples and overcome this issue, besides stating how ""many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This statment provides no actual evidence as to any progress researchers have made, or if anything useful will come from the knowledge of the surafce Venus.

In paragraph 7, the author mentions a technology made of ""silicon carbide"" that has been tested by NASA, and survived a simulation of the conditions of Venus for three weeks. The author does not elaborate on the uses for these strong electronics, and leaves the reader guessing at the purpose of this technology. The author also mentions the use of mechanical computers used in the 1940s during World War II. The author speaks of how these computers make calculations by using gears and levers, but does not elaborate on anything else besides their increased resistance to ""pressure, heat, and other forces."" Once again the author provides no clear reason to the purpose behind the inventions, besides the possible survival of the technology on Venus.

Finally, the author presents his own opinion in paragraph 8. The author states, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planent itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Paragraph 8, as the author has wrote, is entirely opinionated and dangerously optimistic. His reasoning behind the value of ""meeting the challenge of Venus"" is the equivalent to practice for humanity, because ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally indimidating endeavors."" The authors opinion of the research on Venus, as shown by this statment, seems to be entirely based on the idea that we should practice for future endeavors despite the dangers which is not only naiive, but dangerous.

To summarize all of this information, the author shows no clear reason as to why we should risk the resources and manpower to attempt an expedition on Venus. The author provides no purpose for the tools stated besides their increased survivability rate, and the author's opinion is forced onto the reader by stating in paragraph 8 that we should ignore the dangers and doubts of exploration to meet the limits of innovation.

It most likely was once, the most Earth-like planet, ""probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life..."" (Paragraph 4)

Dedicated to the study of Venus, the author claims how not even the dangers will get in his way. They will just simply work their way around them. What makes the study of venus so important is the large possiblity that it used to be just like how Earth is now. If that's true, first off, the only way to be able to know that for certain is to study it. Secondly, we need to know the dangers of what our world could become. In paragraph 8 of ""The Challenge of Explorating Venus"", The author says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

Left without the knowledge of what Venus is like. Left to wonder. No one would ever get anywhere if they just gave up when things got hard, and that's what The author is trying to prove.

When a spaceship when to Venus it couldn't survived the landing for more than a few hours because unlike Venus's surface is hottest in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun.

A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.

Venus's clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in it atmosphere.

Venus may be dangerous but sometime it can be our nearest option for a planetary visit. Long ago, Venus was like our planet Earth because back then it has trees and same atmosphere as Earth. But now Venus is dry up and only a dry vellays where water used to flow a montains left.                ",1,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.0
84A0BBD13652,"In the passage, the author believes that studying Venus is a good idea even though it has many dangers. The author gives many different reasons as to why they think that Venus is a worthy exploration. I do not think that the author supports their idea very well in the passage. The author did a poor job of supporting the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it carries.

I believe that the author does not support their opinion well in the passage. This is because they heavily focus on the negatives of exploring Venus, rather than the positives. For example, in paragraph 2, the author says, ""Each previous mission was unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" Because the author included this, it automatically leaves the reader with a negative connotation towards the exploration of Venus. The author then continues to show more negatives of the exploration of Venus in the third paragraph. The author states, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" Once again, this makes the reader think negatively about Venus. Since the author included this in the passage, it gives the reader another reason to think poorly of studying Venus.

Another thing that the author did poorly was not including any counterarguments to the cons of exploring Venus. It seems that the author does not care about the negatives of Venus' exploration and completely ignores them. They should of included counterarguments against the cons that thy stated. If they did this, it would further prove their opinion. Instead, they just give ideas of how an expedition to Venus would occur. The author then makes it worse. In paragraph six, the author goes on to give more negatives of the process of Venus' exploration. They say, ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere."" This claim adds more negative to the passage. The author poorly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit.

The author does not support their opinion that studying Venus is a good idea even though it has many difficulties. The author displays too many cons of studying Venus instead of the pros. The passage leaves the reader with a negative opinion, rather than a positive one. The author poorly executes their goal of persuading the audience that it is a good idea to explore and study Venus.    ",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8

CF3EA3041657,"The Author supposrts the idea of Venus being worthy of exploring dispite the challanges by stating in Paragraph 8 ""Striving to meet the challanges presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likey lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"". This leads me to belive that if us as humans dont proceed to learn more about this planet we are not going to gain any knowladge and we will never know about the new dicovories we could have made. The Author also continues on about how Venus was belived to be filled with oceans and supported various forms of life and is reffered to as the Earths ""twin"". So this leads me to think that there is more out there than dangerous carbon dioxide blankets, clouds of corrosive acid and above boiling point tempatures. There possibley couldve been life.

This makes me agree with the Author's statemet even dispite the dangers Venus has. With it being so close to Earth and once possibly having living life forms on it. It makes me belive that we should be leanring more about it and building machines to study the materials of this planet. Us Humans make discoveries everyday and we build extrordinary things that you would only see in movies. I definitly think that one day we could build a machine to substand the harsh tempatures and dangerous chemicals Venus has. WIth listening to the Author points i belive that this could open new doors for us and maybe even one day visit the planet. In Paragraph 6 the author states that "" Many reaserchers are working on innovations that woud allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaninfuly to our knowladge of Venus""

This shows me that NASA and other astrologers have already began to try making machines to one day travel to Venus.

Soon one day we will have discoverd the planet of Venus and have learned many new things. This could possibly lead to new discoveries about tecnology and maybe even one day about human life. But we have to use our natural human instict of wanting to know more to find these amazing things.

2D19BA5A2CCB,"In this writing prompt I will be supporting the authors argument. The author belives that Venus should be explored and belives exploring Venus would bring plentiful information that could help the world learn more about other plantes and ours. But for this to be an arguemnt there must be a danger or bad factor, the bad harmful factor is the dangers on Venus. Venus has many dangers that has harmed unmanned spacecrafts. More dangers will be explained further in the prompt.

Venus is often called Earths twin, Venus is the planet that is most related to earth in terms of density and size. But Venus has many more dangers than Earth. Venus has an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide wich means humans will not be able to breath the air. Venus's surface is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than earths pressure. Because of the extremely high amount of pressure that would crush a submarine and melt any metal humans would nto be caple of landing on the surface of Venus without being crushed. And not only does Venus have very high tempertures, pressure and a deadly atmosphere, it also has erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes.

So why would we want to explore Venus if it is so inhospitable? Venus may have once had been like earth, with oceans and lifeforms. Venus does have a rocky surface with valleys, moutains and craters. Venus could be the human races next planet to inhabit if an incident would occur to Earth. Venus is the planet that is most like earth with its terrain and possible past life and water. Although Venus has its deadly dangers to humans, scientists are creating ways for humans to explore Venus and learn about this twin planet.

"" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus,5)

that statement from the excerpt states that scientists have come up with their theorys to explore Venus. They have an idea to send Humans above Venus's atmosphere to explore Venus so they do not melt by the extremely high tempertures or get crushed by the high pressure. With these ideas humans could explore Venus without being harmed and could gather needed information about the twin planet. Scientists are also working on other approaches to studying Venus with possible electronic devices that could last possibly up to three weeks on Venus's surface. With more time scientists could create more ideas and plans to explore Venus's surface.

In this prompt I have explained the twin planet, Venus, and the dangers it holds. The author of the excerpt, "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. I have also explained the dangers Venus posses such as the high tempertures and the extremely high pressure. Scientists are creating more and more theorys of ways to explore

Venus everyday. Therefore in the future I do belive we will explore Venus and that exploring Venus would be very plentiful to the humans race.                  ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

In my opinion, I think that the author didn't do a very good job on explaining the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because the author didn't give much evidence that it is about the pursuit being worthy. In the article the author explains a lot about the challenges of exploring Venus like the extremely hot temperatures and the ""thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide,"" but doesn't explain very much about it being a worthy pursuit. The most that is talked about it being a worthy pursuit is getting insight on the planet like getting samples of the sediment on the surface of Venus and possibly getting the history of the Earth-like planet that is in our solar system.

02B4650A5B6D,"Venus, the Earth's twin or so we thought. With and atmosphere of ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide and average surface tempurture over eight hundred degrees. What dangers do we face trying to study Venus? Or why would we not try to find another place to substain human life?

Why is the author even suggest studying Venus?

Why does the author even support studying Venus? Venus's main atmosphere my be over eight hundred degrees Fahrenheit but just above the cloud such as Earth there is a much calmer atmosphere. Thirty-plus miles above the surface, tempertures drop to around 170 degree ,but the air pressure returns to about the air pressure around sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful and radiaton wouldn't exceed Earth level. Not easy conditions to live in but survivable for humans.

Finding another place to substain human life is a nessisary thing because of the growing population on Earth ,and the ever present threat of gobal warming. Earth is not gonna be here forever and we need a place to live if all goes South. What would be the best place to substain life, well that has not been decided yet but what better way to start than learning about Earth's twin.

The author says "" If our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientist even dicussing further vists to its surface? Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Even with past failures of trying to land on Venus the author supports the idea of exploring it. This is becasue of the thought that Earth will be like Venus in it life time.

3B39F96552F6,"The author of this story does not support his claim that Venus is worth exploring in a good way.

By using a problem- solution method he clearly and completely decribes an issues with exploring and studying

Venus then expalins a possible solution for said issues. But the author does not actually support his idea describing how the knowledge of Venus would be worth the risk.

In "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author gives good substantial reasons to support studying Venus by presenting a risk then simply giving an innovation that would atleast reduce the risk. As shown in the text the author states an issue such as "" ...the planet's surface temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.""

The author continues going on by saying the conditions are far more extreme than anything humans would encounter and how conditions are extremely inhospitable. So he clearly states one problem with studying Venus and all the risks that come along with that problem but then he explains an innovation to reduce the risks. After describing all the risks and dangers in the paragraphs before hand the author then says "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would all scientists to float above the fray."" Then he goes into descriptive detail about how this innovation would work. The author continues using the problem-solution through several of his paragraphs to answer many questions one could have about studying Venus.

Throughout the story he continously talk about innovation and imagination and how with these things we could find a safer way to study Venus but he never actually says how the information will be beneficial or used. In most of the praagraphs the author states the extremely harsh and uninhabitable conditions of Venus. Then he explains how to get around those dangers but does not explain what we gain from knowing and learning about these exact conditions.

If we study Venus we can learn more about the planet, such as, if it was once an earth like planet . It could also help us even save the Earth in the long run. My final reason why we should explore Venus is because it can lead us in exploring other planets.

First of all exploring Venus has a tough task, but we can learn a lot about the planet if we do explore it. We could even find out if it was once an earth like planet. We could discover new oils or new rocks. If we do discover new oil we could even put a mining system on Venus and have more oils. Exploring Venus can even help us find new minerals as well. We could discover many new things if we explore Venus ,dispite it having challenges.

Second of all Venus could have been an earth like planet."" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system"" If this was true we could make more and more explorations and maybe even find out why it heated up so much and if we find everything out it could help us maybe even save earth one day when the sun expands more. It can help us save our planet .

Third of all If we decide to explore Venus we would have to improvise all of our machinery to sustain that heat on Venus. The heat on Venus averages to 800 degrees fahrenheit and also the atmospheric perssure is 90 times greater than what we expierence here on our own planet. We would have to make our machines and robots heat resistant. These innovations could even help us explore other planets. It would make the innovations easier if we want to explore colder planets in the future. This can spark an exploration of many other plantes. It could even help us reach other galexies and explore there. Exploring Venus can help us invent and Innovate many of our technology and it can end up helping us explore the whole solar system.

Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for hunams to study, despite its proximity to us."" This quote helps prove that landing on Venus has been a big challenge, but scientist are willing to overcome these challenges despite the dangers. The authour also states in paragraph six that "" Scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges. Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". This statement also helps prove the point that exploring Venus more is worth taking the risk because researchers are working on innovations to help the trips be more efficent. Which helps the author support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.

The author also uses old projects to help support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The author claims in paragraph seven ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. The devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II. The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions."" This passage suggest that by the use of mechanical parts can be made more resistant or could be adjusted to pressure, heat, and other things. By tweaking this the author suggest that studying Venus is worthy pursit.

In the article the author uses the dangers and old projects to prove that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit. Also by studying Veuns there could be alot more things discoverd by that panet. Yes, it consits of many dangers but their are mutiple things that have been learned from the past experiences that could possibly help us aviod that in the future.

C8CAD42290DE,"Venus is dangerous to human just like many other planets. This author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers that it presents. Should this author really study planet Venus?

Some people look at Venus as Earth's ""twin"", because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and size, and sometimes closer in distance as well. Since Venus is so close to the Earth they have sent multiple spacecrafts tp the planet but no spacecraft survived for more than a few hours. A spaceship has not touched Venus in over three decades. A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide covers Venus, that is even more dnagerous for humans to survive on. On Venus surfce it is over 800 degrees fahrenheit, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what ours is on planet Earth.

Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because a long time ago the planet could have once been just like planet Earth, today Venus still has some features but not many. In this article NASA has discovered a compelling idea for sending humans to Venys to study the planet. To study Venus the scientists would have to float above the fray, which is 30 or so miles above planet Venus. At 30 miles or so above the surface the temperature is still 170 degrees fahrenheit. Scientoss can not take very graphic pictures, get samples of rock, or gas from a distance, therefore the scientists have to get close and personal no metter the risks of he planet. NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus.

42BDA16EAE34,"Studying Venus is a very worthy pusuit. To study Venus we could learn so much more information than we already have. Venus is said to be the closets realtion to Earth but we cant prove that unless we go explore it.

In the Article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author describes Venus as a very dangerous place full of many challenges that could extreamly hurt anyone trying to explore it. Venus has challenges like air pressure, heat, earthquakes, lighting strikes to probes, volcanos, storms, radiation, and highly corrosive sulfuric acid clouds. The heat on the surface of the planet is said to be close to 800° Fahrenheit and the pressure is 90 times greater than it is on Earth. Because of these factors it is almost immposible to be explored by any human.

Venus should still be explored because there are so many things we need to find out about it. The planet Venus ""might have at one point been the most earth like planet in our solar system""(paragraph 4). This is something that would be extreamly important to find out since is could have recources like water and minerals living on the surface. It is also not for sure but ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth""(paragragh 4). This is something that could help scientist to determine if or what life forms could have one survived there. This could also help scientists figure out how other planets eco-systems work and thrive.

Although that would be great to find out, the dangers are so high on the planet that it would be almost impossible to figure out. However, some solutions are there. one solution would be to ""allow scientists to float above the fray""(paragraph 5). This means scientist and explorers would float about the clouds and the surface of Venus and examine it from the top. Doing this would keep everything away from the person and make their travels safer. At that level ""the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth""(paragraph 5). The dangers from the air would be significantly less than that at surface level. This is a very plausable solution that would help us explore and keep science safe.

Venus is a planet that needs to be explored despite the dangers. It would be very profound to science and would help us understand how it use to be in the past, as well as how it has changed over hears. It would be a risky mission but thanks to science and engineering there are always possible solutions to keep everyone semi safe and explore all that we can.   ",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6

They're going to try sending more spacecrafts because ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limitdating endeavors""

When they called Venus ""Evening Star"" beacause during the evening you could see Venus so clear. The reason why you could seen Venus not just because how bright Venus was but also because Venus is closer to us then you think. BUt the point of the nickname is because Venus is a misleading panet in our solar system.

We say that Earth and Venus are twins because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size. People might think that when we say twins they might think that everything is the say on Venus but nobody know how Venus looks like because everytime we send the spacecraft in only last for a few hours.

Same with Mars. These two planets Mars and Venus are close to earth. But all three of them orbit the sun in different speeds. The digfferent in the speeds are meant sometimes that we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus. Not a single spaceship has touched on Venus in more than three decades.

While also Venus is a challenging study for humans. Even more challenging for us is that the clouds of highly corrosive sulferic acid in the Venus's atmosphere.

672C05F8CC1B,""" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is a list of facts, reasons, and statements about Venus. The author believes that exploring Venus would be a good idea. He talks about how "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"". That would be the closest thing to Earth in our solar sytem that we may be able to explore.

Now the challenges of exploring Venus are that there is a constant temperature of around 800 degrees Fahrenheit always on the surface of the planet. There are clouds covering Venus that have high amount of sulfuric acid in them, the planets surface is covered in 97 percent carbon dioxide. If we want to explore this planet we're going to need to find materials that can withstand those horrible conditions. The last recorded spacecraft on Venus only lasted 3 hours. Despite the dangers that come with all of this planet, if we could find a way to explore this planet safely and get gas and rock samples that could tell us a lot about this planets past and if it was similiar to Earth. The technology that we need to explore this planet with we are still yet to find a perfect solution to, we are chipping away at it slowly and finding new ideas that could get us there eventually. This new material that is made out of silicon carbide has been tested in the chamber and has lasted three weeks in conditions like Venus's, That is just getting one step closer to something that could last a long time on the surface of that planet. The harsh temperatures and gases are something that a human can survive through but we need our technology to get through it too. We've used electronic computers in space travel since they would have been able to be used in spacecrafts. The idea is to use a older device that runs off of gears and bearings that can with stand the elements because electronic computers are so delicate they wouldn't last very long in those enviroments. If we are able to find materials that can last long enough to try and get samples that would be our best bet, our first idea is to stay at around 30 miles above the surface of the planet. Temperatures would still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit but we have materials that can withstand those temps. Since the surface of Venus is so cloudy our photograpy methods won't work to really see the surface of that planet. We need to find all the materials and new technology before trying to do something that we havent been able to do successfully yet.

I think that looking at everything we want to accomplish with Venus as a many many steps so we can accomplish it succesfully and be prepared for anything that were to come at us in a mission. I do believe that with the right amount of thought, time, innovation, and energy put into this that it could be something that would be accomplishable. Having the technology to be able to land on Venus and take gas, rock, and sediment samples we can learn a lot about the planets past and maybe find something new.

Throughout this passage, the author gave some details then countered his own details. I don't believe exploring venus is worth it from the acid rain to the dangerous surface levels. So i will be stating his details and then the counter claims he gave aswell.

The author started off explaining facts about venus in paragraph three stating how thick the atomsphere was, The temperature on the surafce, What type of ships can handle the trip, And the distance from the sun. He stated that the atmosphere is thick and 97 percent is carbon dioxide blankets. The text also stated that that the planets surface is about an average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater. He also stated that the Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments such as erupting volcanoes, powerful earth quakes, and lighting strikes to probes seeking land on its surface.

The author also had gave an really good idea for sending humans to study Venus. The main issue with the trip is the surface temperature, So they counter that problem by staying above the surface. They want ot an vehicle float 30 miles above the landscape but another issue is that they would have limited sight. In the text they stated that rendering standerd forms of photo and videography would be ineffective, not to mention but they also won't be able to get any samples of rocks, gas, or anything else.

In the text, It stated NASA is still working on an idea for exploring venus with simplifed electronics made of silicon carbide. The electronics lasted three weeks in an simluation of what Venus's surface would be like. It was stated that another project is looking back at old technolgy that was used back in the 1940s ww2.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth which is why it is referred to as the Earths ''twin''. Most people study geography which is all around the world such as Earth.

The temperature is also an effect on how dangerous it is .

Even though mercury is closer to the sun venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet . This can result in erupting volcanoes and powerful earthquakes .Others on the other hand are fascinated by Venus because it has been the most Earth - like planet in our solar system . Earth is covered of different bodies of water and that could support different forms of life. Venus a very long time ago ,was also covered in large oceans which help others to adapt to .

But technolocial advancements are encouraging the further study of Venus and speeding up the process.

By teaching us that Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"" and that it is relatively the closest planet to ours in the solar system, the author sees that ""Stiving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because of human curiosity...Our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8).

6024CD8AC300,"Venus, the second plant in our solar syetem, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" is one one of the brightest lights in the night sky. Venus is also often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" since Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Since its distances is close to Earth, scientists have wanted to study and examine this planet up close, but this would prove to be dificult. Each mission to Venus was unmanned, and for good reasons, since many spacecrafts dont even survive the landing for more than a few hours. This explanins why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. In the following paragraphs I will desribe the dangers that are on Venus, why scientists want to study the planet, and what are some new approches to studing Venus.

Their are a lot of reasons why humans can't travel or study Venus. One of the reasons why we cant study Venus is that the atmosphere is completely comprised of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, which is toxic to humans. The second reason, are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. Another reason is that on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more exstreme for any human to handle; the environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of Earth's oceans and Venus's environment would liquefy many different types of metals. Beyound high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present more additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface.

For all the dangers towards humans, why do scientists discuss further plans for visits to Venus's surface? Many astronomers and scientists are fasinated by Venus because it might have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Many people say that long ago, Venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported different forms of life. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planets surface is similar to Earth, it has a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Overall Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit.

Since Venus is impossible to study at this time, NASA is working on different approaches to studying Venus. For example, simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface, and the result is that the electronics lasted for three weeks in such conditions. Another project is loocking back to an old technology called mechanical computers.

01D9F8A6B312,"There are many ways to explore Venus with the challenges on the way and some of those ways are how Venus is covered with atleast a 97% carbon dioxide, and then finally how Venus is sometimes refered to as earths twin.

The author states in the story called "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" that there is ways on being able to explore and learn more about Venus. Venus has a lot of carbon dioxide on it that its as thick as a blanket. In paragrapgh 3 it states that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. In this quote "" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" This quote means that Venus has a lot of information to offer the people if they want to learn more about Venus and how thick the atmosphere is also how the atmosphere of Venus has sulfuric acid.

In the story it states that Venus is refered to as one of Earths twin since its close to the planet earth. Venus being called Earths twin is a way of saying how Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. This quote, "" Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds."" This quote means that the reason why Venus is refered to as Earths twin is because it has a lot of things in common with other planets like Mars, and Earth itself that are also refered to as Earths twin most of the time.

There are many ways to explore Venus with the challenges on the way and some of those ways are how Venus is covered with atleast a 97% carbon dioxide, and then finally how Venus is sometimes refered to as earths twin. So that is what evaluates how well the author supports the idea that stuying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Also so people can learn about the planet Venus more but to also be able to explore the planet aswell after they have learned about it so they can try to stay out of danger while being up there on Venus.         ",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
00F22B7F3998,"The authors support of the idea of going to Venus is not very well known, we can only infer whether they are for it or against it because they never fully specify. The author give some pros and cons to the exploration of the planet but does not pick one side more than the other. I believe that they author is against the idea of Venus exploration.

The authors pros and cons list combat eash other because, the author gives a pro on the exploration of Venus but instantly combats it with another con to weigh it out. One example of this is in paragraph 5 when the author states that the conditions of floating above planet Venus would be difficult but survivable for humans. However, right after making that statement, the authors first sentence in paragraph 6, combats the idea that it is survivable for humans because the article states, ""However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and vidoeography ineffective."" From that statement we can infer that the author doesn't really see the exploration of humans going being very useful but, we can only infer because the author never specifies, for or against.

Another way we can infer that the author is against it, is by looking at paragraph 3 when the author is talking truthfully about the planet. The author explains that planet Venus has a thick atmorsphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide and that the planet's surface temperature averages out at over, 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The way that the author describes Venus, is not in a way of much liking or making it sound like a good planet to send our people to. The author explains how dangerous Venus is by listing the weather barreries like ""...erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes and frequent lightening strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."", all in paragraph 3. By listing how dangerous the weather is, listing how hot and unlivable it is, and by saying that the lightening frequently strikes the probes trying to get into the planets atmosphere to land, we can only infer that the author doesn't really think that the dangers of humans being out into this kind of situation, is worth it.

Additionally, one last way we can infer that the author doesn't favor the idea of Venus exploration is that when in paragraph 2, the author states, ""Each previous mission is unmanned, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" That statment really pushes the idea that the author defiently doesn't not favor the idea of the exploration using man and spacecraft. But once again, we can only infer because the author never gave a clear personal opinion.

In conculsion, I believe that the author does not favor the exploration and does not think that the study of Venus is a worthy pursuit depsite the dangers it provides. The pros and cons weigh each other out, the planet is too dangerous with the heat, the weather, and the obsticles on the surface. The overall thought of the author shows no favor towards the exploration of Venus. ",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
48D41DB0EFB6,"A thick Atmosphere containing 97% carbon dioxide, Venus is a dangerous planet. It's extremely high pressures and dangerouly scorching surface, it is beyond comparison to Earth's environment. Although its proximity to us is closer than that of mars, its reputation precedes it as a challenging planet. Despite the dangers, Venus is a worthy pursuit because it was once an Earth-like planet in our solar system.

To start off with, it's geographic features are similar to that of Earth. In the article, on paragraph 4, it says, "" Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various life forms."" On paragraph 4, further down, it says, "" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and inlcudes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."" Based on these two evidence, Venus's features; which once included rocks and oceans, can be found on Earth.

Next, the technologies provided by Sophisticated Organizations and companies can help through the exploration process. On parargraph 5, it says, "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions...would allow scientists to float above the fray."" As we move further down the paragraph, it says,"" Solar power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."" From these two evidence, NASA's solution can be benefical because the explorers wouldn't be exposed to the surface; they can avoid the unfriendly conditions, and they can gain acess to the solar power needed to power the machine, it's a win-win.

Then finally, the studying process. On paragraph 7, it says, ""

Some simplied electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber stimulating the chaos of Venu's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditons."" From the same paragraph, it says, "" Systems that use mechanical parts can be more resistent to the pressure, heat, an other forces."" From the simplied electronics to the mechanical parts; which both have been proven useful in the conditions of venus, can be used to collect data. the mechanical parts won't melt and 3 weeks for resisting the conditions is extremely useful, these are the solutions that can be used o study Venus.

To end this essay, Venus is worthy due to the similarities it posesses. From all those planets, it was Venus's proximity and it's features that are analogous to that of Earth. Scientists can learn what happened to Venus through the technologies given. These technological solutions provides safe ways to travel and to collect data from Venus. Despite the dangers, it is the only planet that was Earth-like, it's time frame for space travel is much less than that of Mars. This is an opportunity of the time, and the author is trying to inform us that we should take the opportunity and explore. We have the technology, we know that venus is close to us, and the fact that it was once a twin of Earth, that's fascinatiing. Aren't you curious to find out what happened to Venus?",4,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.6
E8C1C58F8A0A,"In the introduction, the author is describing Venus and explaining how ""The Evening Star."" Is the nickname, but beyond that- paragraph 1 and 2 wasn't explaining why you should pursuit it.

However one statement that does in paragraph 2 is ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."" Meaning it's not that far away to reach.

Yet one paragraph that is arguing with wanting to go to Venus is ""Each previous mission was unamed, and for good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.""

However one statement from paragraph 4 that shows that they wanna go to Venus is ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" This paragraph also claims that Venus was most likely covered with oceans and still supported different forms of life.

In paragraph 5 though, one of the statement claims ""not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" Stating that Venus's climate and other factors made being there a pain, but again, it's for sure possible.

In paragraph 5 as well it says ""(NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.""

Going a little further, paragraph 6 just explains that to understand more about Venus, that they would have to get much closer, and also describes how scientists are working on innovations that would make the tech and gear that is necessary better and able to last longer.

They are doing so because they can't understand as much when they have no evidence

Paragraph 7 has no claims on how you should go to Venus whatsoever, but instead it is talking about older tech used in the 1800s.

However in Conclusion, in paragraph 8 they stated ""Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" Another line that they used is ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubt."" Saying that no matter how many risks just so happen to be in Venus, perhaps if we were able to get there worry free, we'd come back with things we didn't know from before.

A97501292742,"Venus is a planet in our solar system and is one of the closest to Earth. The harsh conditions on Venus's surface make it dificult to explore though. But scientist are eager to do this because Venus might have had life a while back. It might have had oceans too to support life.

Venus's conditions are so harsh that no space craft sent to the planet survived the landing for a few hours Venus has a thick atmosphere that is almost 97% carbon dioxide and is one of the hottest planets in our solar system. Its average temperature is about 800 degrees Fahrenheit. That's not all though, Venus also has acid rain and errupting volcanoes. It is truely a harsh planet.

However, NASA had an idea for sending humans to study Venus. This may sound like a crazy idea, but NASA will make sure the conditions will be safe enouph for humans be safe and study Venus. They could make a a blimp-like vehicle hovering about 30 miles above the surface of Venus. At that height, the temperature would be about 170 degrees Fahrenheit and the air pressure would be simular to sea level on Earth. These conditions are a little rough, but survivable for humans.

There could be many new discoveries found on venus. It may be a hard task, but maybe one day, we could find a new discovery that could change the world. Who knows what we will discover on our next mission to Venus.      ",2,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.2
F8259E04E6A4,"""Challenge in Life and its Risks""

Humans have always been interested on exploring planets, countries depending on where you are going, islands, no matter the dangers or risks that can be present there. Then people talk and write about their experiences and what they discovered in there. Exploring Venus can be dangerous, interesting, and scary but excited at the same time.

In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author says that it presents dangers study Venus, but is also a worthy pursuit. Venus and Mars are one of the closet planets to Earth. ""Earth, Venus, and Mars, our planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds."". The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we had experience in our planet. ""Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun"".""Beyond high pressure and heat , Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface"" But for some people it is still interesting to know more about Venus.

Astronomers are fascinated about Venus, for what is there and what was there long ago. """"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"". Venus, long ago could be covered largely with oceans and had supported forms of life. "" The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, montains, and craters"". So, that can be scary but still for some people is excited to know a a different planet.

People already went to the Moon, Venus sometimes is te=he nearest option for a planetary visit despite Mars. Venus once was probabably covered by oceans and could have supported various forms of life. ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth"". In Venus the tempetures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth: such an envirionment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"". But anyways NASA is working and having ideas for sending humans to study Venus."" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers"".

It is good that people propuse themselves challenge, and not be afraid of wanting to know more about the world and people should not be limited by its dangers and risks, or the thinking that you cannot do it.

25D0D32B0AFC,"Venus is a interesting but amazing planet. It has a nickname of the ""Evening Star"". It is the planet that is the closest related to earth, which makes sense for it also being referred to as Earth's ""twin."" It being so closely related to our home planet has caught the eye of some. It is a planet no one can get close to however some think it is worth some risks to discover what lies there. You may be thinking what risks are there? Well there are quite a few. The author does a great job explaining what the risks are and how harsh Venus can be. However I do not believe they explained enough of the benefits that support why we should explore it despite the risk factor involved.

For Venus being Earth's ""twin"" it's very different from earth. The author included the facts of the atmosphere of Venus is made up of almost ninty-seven percent of carbon dioxide and it's clouds have highly corrosive sulferic acid in them. Earth does not have either of those and humans breathe oxygen and in return produces carbon dioxide. Humans really couldn't benefit from the lack of oxygen compared to the almost ninty-seven percent carbon dioxide. The almost other three percent may not even be oxygen but the author doesn't include that detail. Earth doesn't have an average of over 800 degress on its surface unlike Venus. The author then included that the pressure is 90 times greater on Venus then it is on Earth, that pressure can crush a submarine.

There is even more that prevent us from discovering more on Venus. The weather there can and will include erupting valcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning storms. Which is really not ideal at all for trying to explore.

NASA is working on ways to get up close with Venus. According to the passage they have been testing different electronics made of silicon carbide in chambers simulating the conditions on Venus. They discovered it could last up to three wees. Their other idea was to have scientists float above the fray. But they couldn't take rocks samples or anything by doing so. It would be a good way, but they really couldn't get the research they wanted. As well as the fact it wouldn't be easy conditions because of the radiation.

According to the author, Astromers are very interested in Venus because at one point they believe it was ""the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" They believe it was covered with oceans and even sustained life just like Earth does now. In current day they know that it still does have similarities to Earth like valleys, mountains, and craters. But is that really all worth it?

The author then says the value of returning there is indisputable. The author really included a lot more risks than benefits of returning there. The support they gave wasn't that supportive. Then would say something beneficial for example, they could actually observe from the fray but they only have limited sight of the planet. It really just adds to the negative part of the exploration. The article seemed to have more negativity than positivity. The risks drowned out the support which in turn made the author's point not as strong.             ",5,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.8
907135C0570D,"Venus may be a worthy pursuit of study even with the dangers that come with this challenge due to the information that the author provided within this article. The planet Venus may be useful in some way even though it is extremely dangerous and nonhabitable. The atmosphere on Venus is really thick to where it is close to impossible to see anything without being on the planet. Venus is the closest planet to Earth in size, density and in distance as well. Venus can be seen pretty easily from Earth however only through and observatory or telescope. Venus could either be a good idea or a bad idea due to it's positives and negatives but we also don't know too much about Venus.

Some of the difficulties of trying to study Venus are really deadly in many ways. The atmosphere of Venus is 97 percent carbon dioxide which is extremely deadly and makes it really difficult to see Venus while off planet. The clouds of Venus are made of highly corrosive sulfuric acid which is obviously a problem toward the study. The planet's surface temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The atmospheric pressure is at least 90 times greater than the pressure on Earth. These are some of the most hostile and extreme conditions of just about any other planet within the solar system.

Venus is also a necessary item of study due to the possibilities that could be created by studying the planet. Venus could have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system but it was a long time ago. It has been said that Venus was probably covered with oceans and bodies of water and other resources that could have supported multiple forms of life. The planet has many formations that are similar to Earth such as mountains, valleys and craters. Venus is our nearest option for a planetary expedition. The value of studying Venus is unchangable and can be unlimited depending on what could be found on Venus.

NASA has some ideas on how to get humans to Venus such as a blimp-like vehicle which can hover about 30 or so miles above the landscape.

Solar power would be plentiful, Radiation wouldn't be too high, and temperatures would be survivable. This vehicle would create survivable conditions for humans to complete their study and learn way more about Venus. NASA has tested using earlier technology made of silicon carbide which would survive in Venus conditions for about three weeks. The mechanical computer could be used for Venus because it is not electronical but it instead has mechanical parts which could be changed to have resistance to heat, pressure and other damaging forces.

There are many factors that can cause the Venus study and exploration to happen or to be dismissed. There are things that could be developed which can possibly make a way to study Venus without having too many problems. Also, there are many obstacles which are in the way of the study such as the planet conditions or the technology which would be required to develop the items needed for the study. There are many positives and negatives to this study but neither is greater than the other because there are ideas in the making about how to survive on Venus however there are many things which can get in the way of the development of the technologies. This study will probably take much time before it can actually be initiated because it will take time to gather everything that is needed and it will take some time to actually arrive at Venus and produce some results.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
D7A4DB22C8EB,"The author of The Challenge of Exploring Venus suggested to study venus is a worthy pursuit despite it condtions and or dangerous risks. I think the author thinks studying Venus is worthy based of the author saying in Paragragh five althought it is 170° F(Fahrenheit) it may be difficultt condtions, but it still survivable for humans.

More evidence of it being worthy of studying is in Paragragh seven saying NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus. From one of there examples, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venuss surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions, meaning it is possible to find research. Research is our only way of getting data proven in Paragragh six stating ""researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks"".

And my final piece of evidance stating it is worthy of studying Venus is in Paragragh's six and eight ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective. Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.

C7142A26576B,"A mission of going to Venus is impossible for us, well atleast right now. In the future there is probably going to be a very high chance to visit the Earth like planet but right now, I don't see the possibilty of that happening. I think our focus should be exploring Mars, I think it's a more realistic mission. The author does have some good evidence to back up on why there's a possibility to explore Venus.

The author said that Venus is Earth's ""twin"" and that is true! Venus is the, ""closest planet to Eartth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."". Venus probably had what Earth has right now which are oceans. Even now, Venus is similar to Earth in terms of surface. The planet has a rocky surface and sediment and also similar valleys, mountains, etc but it's not all good stuff about Venus, the planet also has enviroments that are not suitable for human life and I don't think it will anytime soon in my life time. The author does talk about it and gives facts on why it's hard to explore Venus. It has ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide"". The clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid, the surface of Venus is a flaming 800+ degrees Fahrenheit. That's hot! The pressure alone is 90 times greater than Earth. A submarine accustomed to dive into our deep ocean would be crushed on the Venus surface. We won't be able to see through the thick clouds even if we hovered the planet. Therefore, it would be nearly impossible to et samples of anything!

After all, I think NASA and other private rocket organizations should just focus on going to Mars which like Venus, it's going to be hard. They should see it as a challenge which im sure they do but Mars should be our focus. The author gave good reasons on why we should and shouldn't explore Venus. Which ever planet gets explored first really won't matter. It's history being made for humans and that's what matters in my opinion.",3,Exploring Venus,Text dependent,0.4
65F5C8D8AAEC,"Venus and Earth are both very similar is the same way but also very different, in there own ways they are unique but venus is the real mystery. Venus's temperature is about 800 degrees and the distance from the sun in much closer than Earth but its also the only planet that scientist think that could substain life. So we are going to talk about what Venus is like and how Venus compres to Earth and what we have and will try an do to study and explore Venus.

So Earth and Venus are called the ""twin planets"" but there not that similar because one can substain life and one cant for right now. Venus is rotating around the sun alot faster then Earth and so that is why a year on Venus would be short compared to one on Earth. We have sent many spacecraft/spaceships to venus and successfully made it but its been more than 30 years since that has happen. So the reason for that is Venus has a 97% carbon dioxide ""blanket"" thats covering the atmosphere and thats why its so much hotter then Earth and is unfit for a human. Specially because of all the nature causes this heat brings like volcanoes and powerful earthquakes along with alot of lightning strikes that go all the way to the surface on venus.

The plan that NASA came up with is that, since we cant land on Venus because of the heat and pressure we would try and hover over the blanket of heat which would still be pretty hot. But only 170 degrees compared to 800 on the surface which we would have to be about 30 or more miles above the surface for humans to be able to live. But whats the point to risks lives if all you do is take pictures 30 miles above the surface, you can do that with a robot and not have to risk lives but humans want the challenge. But NASA isnt giving up they are trying to create different idea like making ""eletronics made of silicon carbide""(paragraph 7)

and those have been tested in a simulation chamber and has but tested and proven to work. Which supposed what I claim adn want NASA to send a team or a test dummy to see if it will resist the temperatures of Venus.

All in all I feel that the author does support the idea of studying venus and hthat it is worthy of the danger that it might present. And also I do as well think it is worth the trip even with the dangers. But everything I believe should be tested in the chamber as least twice before they go on the actual mission.

In the article it explains how Venus has metals and rocks, having different metals and different rocks can help out with things we might need. Having new types of metals could help us make stronger things like, weapons, cars, airplanes and towers. Venus also is a planet that is closer to the sun then we are so we might find something that could help us in the long run. We could maybe find new life and study it for future things. But there is a problem with studing venus....ITS TOO HOT, Venus is close to the sun making it hot like hotter then earth on its hottest day. But NASA came up with a idea. In the article it says that ""Imagine a blimp like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape"" that would help alot becuase then we wouldnt have to send a human t get the information that we need to pull from Venus.
