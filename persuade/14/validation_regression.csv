I think that all students should to community service , because it'll help us be more responsible , caring , and it'll make the place we help a better place to be . Some people may think it takes out to much time but really it doesn't , the community service can be during school hours , or on your weekend while doing the things you normally do , lets say your going out with your friends to the park , you can clean up some litter on the floor , maybe help the kids around you , take pictures for proof and that's all that needs to be done . Its not something hard to do and in the end it benefits you and the area around you , so technically its a win , win situation . Maybe to get more kids to do it is by for all the community service they do it will give them extra credit in some of there classes and maybe a little prize for them in the end of the year , now i bet all the kids will be willing to do community service . If some of the kids are still a little more stubborn they can still do community service but just not so much time , just a couple hours , hey it better then nothing right ?

Anyways community service can be a fun experience think about it helping out at your old elementry school visiting your old teachers , remebering when you were there just younger , seeing old pictures of you there , making new friends even if they may be younger . I think that it would be a great experience for all the students , so that is my opinion , good luck deciding !",3,Community service,Independent,0.4

I don't think that students should be required to take community service because it would just take time out of their school work.

Also Students might have to do things when they get home like babysit their sister or brother but if students are required to do community service then their parents might be late to work. Another example is that students might fail a test/quiz because they don't have enough time to study do to the community service.

Therefore it would the service would make the kids more tired and would not pay attention to what the teacher is explaining.

Also students have sports after school and if they are late then the coach might not play them in games and or events.

Another example is that students might only see their parents a half an hour before they go to work but with the community service the students would not see their parents at all.

Those are some reasons that the students at SCHOOL_NAME should not have to do community service.

But in some cases it would be a good thing because it would keep our planet cleaner and there wouldn't be as much pollution then there is now.

Also it would help if we clean up the earth because the rate a global warming would be decreasing.",2,Community service,Independent,0.2

Kids should be required to perform community service because there are trash bags, litter and many harmful things in life which people just think they useless and pointless but can kill people easily . By doing community service we will have a safe city and a green environment. Picking up trash is helpful just not for us but the sea animals because all that trash and garbage you throw away goes to the ocean and kills many animals. Many people take things for grantee but others care and will not stop until what they want is done.

By doing community service you can do good deeds and maybe even get rewarded. There are many people in life that perform bad deeds and get busted for them. There are fines on signs that say things like littering=$1000 fine. People disobey other people by saying so and so threw trash on the ground. If something falls out your pocket then it is your responsibility to pick that trash up. some people say why do we have to pick up trash if its not going anywhere but trash travels like when a fuzz ball goes from one place to another.

When kids take opportunity to take time off a Saturday morning they are helping the environment. When people stay home playing video games or hatching t. v eating chips those chips bags blow out of a garbage truck and kill many sea animals. A seagull can see a trash bag that looks like fish and take it up and die by swallowing the trash bag. A sea turtles favorite food is jelly fish but can easily mistaken it for a garbage or plastic bag. There are many harmful and dangerous things in life that can kill people and animals if you aren't care full where you put your trash so community service is a really good idea.

I understand that you want us to do community service, but some people just don't have time to do things like that. Like, say that you say we have to do it on a Saturday at 9:00am to 12:00pm not everybody can make that time. Also not everybody want to do it. I think that you should do it at a different school because you are trying to force us to do community service and we don't want to do it. Why don't you get out of that desk and you do it too.

Sorry, not to be mean, but I really want to do it, but I don't have time for it. I'm in the 8th grade and i get a lot of homework to do. And I have to keep up with my grades. And I have to focus on the CMT test that is coming up. I think that it should be optional weather we do community service.

I, along with most of my fellow students are against requiring us to do community service long or short. Many people already have a completely busy day and can barely finish what they're doing now in a 24 hour period. Community service is meant to be volunteer work if you have free time to help the community out. Not to be thrown on the Children in school.

Not only is the idea completely ridiculous, but we go to school for educational needs, not to clean up the town. There are kids that are failing classes in school because they don't have the time to study, or do homework, or just are flat out lazy. If some kids don't have the time to study or do homework where would they fit in the time for community service. Also, the lazy kids don't even want to be in school half the time so they most likely just wouldn't do the community service anyway.

We don't mind lending a helping hand when we can but for it to be forced upon us it'd be a nuisance. I know that even things I enjoy doing when I can, if people force me to do them i don't enjoy it as much if at all anymore. The students will volunteer when they can, and it should stay that way

We're hoping you see where many students and myself stand on this idea. It should NOT happen. We'll help as much as possible when we can but requiring us to help is not something any of us support. We do thank you for the concern on the town we live in but, this just should not be mandatory. We rest our case.

Dear principal,

I think we the students need to help the community. I think it is right to help people in need. My father, my sister, and I help two homeless people. We get food, cloths, and give them tents that they can sleep in. I know this is right because my uncle that's an Indian taught me to help people in need. I tilted my head when he said that. He said "" You do not remember when a pack of dogs attacked you?"" I said"" no i do not remember."" He told me what happened. He said "" we got out of the car and started to go inside the house. You heard a noise and looked around to see where the noise came from. I turned around and saw you laying on the ground with a pack of dogs ripping your cloths and biting you every where they could got. I ran out towards you. The pack of dogs ran away and I picked you up. You had your eyes closed and were barely breathing. My wife called for a doctor and the doctor came. He fixed you up and said"" that was a good thing that I came running to your need for help and that you need to be watched until you wake up."" I stayed right by you and my wife got mad when I did not move from your side. She would come in to see how you were and saw me crying and praying that you would live."" The week from the attacked happened, You started to come around. I ran to you. The doctor came to check on you and he said"" she will start to act different so do not worry."" I sat in a chair, holding your hand. Your eyes started to open. I yelled "" hey come here everyone."" They came and gathered around me. Your eyes were opening slowly then they opened fully. We smiled. You got up and tried to walk but fall. I said to you "" stay in bed and rest."" you did what i told you to do. I give you breakfast in bed. You started to act like a wolf so the doctor came and saw how you were acting and how hard my wife tried to stop you. He said"" Its useless."" My wife said "" why is it useless?"" the doctor said"" the bites she got have made her think that she is a wolf and she will be like this for life but she will act like the way she is acting right now under a full moon maybe when under a full moon she will act a lot like a wolf and dogs will come running to her then she will run with the dogs that came to her.""

Community service is a great way to help today's communities, and also a way to meet new people. However, not all people would want to do this. I personally think that community service is a volunteer job and that people of the community should do it at their own free will. Depending on what type of services the students would provide would vary the response in enthusiasm. My opinion to community service would be that every one needs to do their share in helping.

Most students are very compatible and can be convinced to do something that might not sound fun or appealing at all; but when it comes to adults putting in their share, they normally don't have the time to do so when they have work. I think its up to the youth of today to keep our communities in good shape. Maybe after school programs where students and friends could get together and have fun either cleaning up or help younger children or elders. Snacks and trips could be given and make community service less than a job and more of a hobby.

Requiring students to do community service would get things done faster and more efficiently rather than asking them to do it on their own time. For example, if you ask a random student, ""Would you like to help me pick up trash?"" they are most likely to say they have something better to do. If they were told they have to, it would get done and if you added something that is entertaining to that person they are more likely to come back and help again.

Community service can be done by any age group. Taking a group of 7-8 year olds to a park to pick up trash would be one of the simple was to teach the younger age group that their a part of this community. Later they can go play on that playground and enjoy themselves. 10-15 year olds could help teach the younger group or head out with their friends and help out at the schools, any age higher could do the same.

There are many ways to help, and many people to do the job enforcing students to do that job would be an complete positive to our community. I think when i get a chance i will do community service within my neighborhood and with my friends. The smallest of jobs can make a big impact.

I do not approve of you requiring students to perform community service. Community service was something designed to punish people who do mischief. Requiring students to perform community service may make some students feel liken trouble makers. The school should not take away time that students could use to study, do homework, or exercise.

If you do require students to do community service then some students may do more mischief because they will be doing community service anyway. If these students do more mischief that will be more work for the other students to do. If community service is required the law department will have no way of punishing students for what they have done.

If you require students to take part in community service then some parents may be offended that their child is required to do something that was originally a punishment. While doing community service students may meet kids who got it as a punishment and befriend them while that student is from the ""bad group"". Since community service takes up a large amount of time students grades may start to slip because they have less time to study and do homework.

My reasons for this decision are students grades will plumate, students may start hanging out with the wrong group, and the law department will have almost no way of punishing students for mischief.            ",3,Community service,Independent,0.4

Community service is a very important thing to do. It is the act in which you are giving back to the community which houses you and your family. After all, if no one does community service, the whole town would be a mess. So students should be required to complete a set amount of community service based on their capacity to be able to help.

Many students who go to the elementary probably lives quite close to it. The majority most likely grew up in the same place that they live now. This would mean that they would have benefited off of the people in the past keeping the place clean. It only makes sense for a receiver of free services to return the favour in one way or another.

When required to do community service, students can help pick up garbage or plant flowers to make the overall cleanliness of the community better. Students can also volunteer to help out with the school itself in thanks for the education received from going there for free. Students will be able to show gratitude and improve the community through community service.

Although most students may live close to the school some may live farther away and even out of the community itself. These students may not want to help out as they do not owe the community much but still attend the school. They shouldn't have to help out the community because they aren't a part of it. In addition some students may just not be able to comply from a physical injury or a disability that impedes them from helping out. They should be accounted for and excused from doing so.

In most cases however, students should be able to do something even if it is small. Possibly helping an elderly person across a street or picking dropped things up for people. Community service should be a requirement to always help out whenever available to do so or when the student knows that they are capable of doing a larger task. In conclusion students should always be aware that they must help out the community but unless they are capable, in which they will be required to help, not have to do any difficult tasks and only small ones.",4,Community service,Independent,0.6

Community service is great for the community. All students should have a required amount of community service hours. They should have required community service because, it sets a good example for the future, it is better than doing nothing, and it is better to give then receive.

Community service should be required in schools because i sets a good example for the future. Did you know that it is a proven fact that if you do community service once 74% of people will do it again. Also if younger kids see the older kids participating in community service then the younger kids are more likely to want to participate themselves. I can connect to this because i participate at my church teaching kids about God and other stuff about the church while having fun at the same time. Kids from my class have came and talked to me. It turns out that they would like to participate like me. Community service will only help the kids of tomorrow. Community service should be required at schools because it sets a good example for the future.

I feel community service at schools should be required at schools because it is better than doing nothing. Kids average 1-2 hours of free time. you can do a lot with 2 hours. Making service mandatory will fill that hole and help the community at the same time. One day i was texting my friend and he had nothing to do. I was working down at the shelter so I talked to my boss and she hired him. We had an awesome time. This really helped my friend. Community service should be mandatory because it better then doing nothing.

Finally, community service should be required in school because need to learn it is better to give than receive. For example, giving to someone else is better than receiving anything. One year for Christmas when I was young all I did was keep asking for gifts. Then my mom told me a story. She once helped her friend pick up litter around the school. The principal saw their work. He spread the word that these two girls were helping the community and willing to do anything to help. Eventually they got good paying jobs. They gave a little of their time to school and they got something back. Community service should be required because it is better to give then receive.      ",4,Community service,Independent,0.6

I think that helping the community is a good thing to do for the school. Cleaning up or picking up the trash from side walks, the grass, from rivers or lakes or anything like that. We could learn lots of things like math like picking up one plus two more makes three. We could do science by saying their are so many germs and different kind of germs and what could they be.

It is important to pick up litter so that the earth wont get polluted. If we don't pick up the litter its going to effect the earth. We could also take half that wants to pick up litter and let them pick it up for maybe a hour or two.

Then we can get the other half that didn't, let them do work until the other half came. When they did the half that didn't want to pick up litter, they could have their work finished and let them pick up litter for an hour or two. But if that wouldn't work we could start a club or a meeting after school for the students that wanted to pick up litter come and join the club.

If it helps the earth from pollution or anything bad happening to the earth i think we should help the community. I think we should do it so it wouldn't make our school look bad in any way. so people wont think that we don't care about our school. so i think helping the community is a good idea.

I think students should only be required to perform community service if they would like, or have time to. Not all people like to help the community and it would be hard for them to participate in something they don't want to do. For other students who love to help out the community in which they live, they should do community service.

For example some people may have a busy family schedule after school hours or on the weekends. It may be a complication if they had to fit other activities in their daily schedule. It would be only fair to understand family schedules.

Another example is that many other students have school activities after school that they are already dedicated to. Community service could interfere with allowing people to do more of what they want with their lives.

Lastly, some students who live in the community may like where they are but don't think they could be of any help. No one should have to do community service they don't want to.

Good Afternoon, I hope all is well. I am writing to you regarding my opinion on weather you should require all students to perform community service. Well, I personally think all students should be required to perform community service, because it can really help the less fortunate and homeless. And with our community working together to help one another we can rapidly make the world a better place.

There are many ways students can help their community. For example they can cook food and send it to a local soup kitchen, donate food or clothing to the poor, or even form a resistance group to help stop world hunger! I think its possible for students my age to change the world to make it a better place. Which by that we would also be following the ways of Jesus. There are many commercials on television that persuade children my age and younger to help make the community a better place and I for one am fully in favor of it. I think its great that there is other people in the world like us that want to help the community and the less fortunate.

It would really make a huge difference if you required all students to perform at least 15 hours of community service to help others.

I believe that all of the students of our school should be required to perform community service. Some of my friends clean up litter and tutor elementary school children. Some of my friends don't think it is a good idea to do this because they are too busy doing other things that take up their valuable time. If you make community service mandatory, then my friends will have something good to do in their free time and in turn help the community our school is in.

My peers think community service is a boring chore to do. It does not have to be a chore. There are plenty of different things that they can do. They can perform music for the seniors at a senior center. The seniors would like that. They can do a park clean up for our parks which people just throw their garbage in. They can also help with renovating some of these buildings that need help. They can also get service hours by helping out at our school or different schools by doing various jobs around the building like helping out another teacher. If they want, they can visit a preschool and read to the children there as well as helping out the teachers there too.

By doing this, the students of our school could do something productive with their free time instead of playing video games or watching television. They can get a group of their friends together to do the community service with them. Then, they could hang out and work at the same time. If you make this required, then the community can be more beautiful than what it already is. Thank you.

From criminals to even students that behave badly and do not focus on their studies. Community service can make students into a better, friendlier, and well behaved.

The next topic on my agenda of community service is that the students form more discipline. Did you know that only 5% of students do community service hours? That means that basically the entire school is a ruckus! And do you know why? It is because their parents never taught them how to be friendly or how to have manners. If their own parents couldn't teach them then who will? If you allow mandatory community service in our school, I believe that you will be making the right decision.

I think students are require to take community service because it helps them get organized. It also helps out the community to be more cleaner. For example doing community service helps kids stay out of trouble such as gangs, violence, and drugs. Also it helps kids to be more disciplined, more respectful, more caring for our planet, more careful, more safe, and more mature. One Example is that kids who do community service are more organize. Community service is helpful to kids that get bored at home.

Sometimes people think that doing community service is just a waste of time because they don't want to do it or they think that it is just boring. But community service can show you new things. Such as taking care for the elderly, taking care of the planet, respecting others, and helping others.

For example, many students have after school activities such sports, tutoring, and homer work club. On top pf all that, there's home work and chores for students to do.

I would like to inform you about the works and outcomes of community service.

Many kids in schools across the country perform a task to help others out. I believe that this is the right and just thing to do. Everyone is a part of a community and they should do their part to help in any way possible.

There is a familiar saying, ""Charity begins at home."" Yes, this is true, but you can take that charity to other places in your environment. Community can make a person, but people also make a community. Human beings shape the way of life for all people and creatures. People need to help out in order to keep a society friendly, civil, and fair.

Everyone needs a base to start off from. Many start from home, but others don't.

This is why school is a place to begin. Besides getting an education and being social, a school is an example of a hard working atmosphere. Kids help teachers, teachers help kids, parents help the school, and so on. This builds a person's character. TEACHER_NAME, you are the head of SCHOOL_NAME, and you have the job of making this school a great place. I think that the kids of SCHOOL_NAME should help you and your ways by taking part in community service. You have the power to enforce a rule that states every child must help in community service at least weekly. I already tutor and babysit some students of SCHOOL_NAME, and I help clean up my neighborhood. If I can do that, think of how many people could! Then we would have a healthier and cleaner community.

People look up to you. Please help others take part in community service. It will be for the better. SCHOOL_NAME is a caring school that would make its community shine. Let's start helping out! Getting involved is the first step to building a safer and stronger community.

Community Service!

I would like for you to take into consideration of making all of the Students in seventh and eight grade to do at least 20 hours of community service to be able to graduate. The reason I am bringing up this topic to you is because it shows the community that the students of SCHOOL_NAME

are helping to keep our community clean and to help other people understand that everybody does something for the planet. I see so many people litter in and outside of school and I don't think they realize how important it is to keep our planet clean. So we don't have pollution and other problems.

I think that we should start to recycle and by doing all of this more people might come to our school to enroll there children. The publicity could be good for our school and then later on for the students. The children can be learning good life lessons and it can help them to keep up the good work all the way threw there lives. It creates a good building block for the students and it will help our school and planet be clean. The more people seeing us clean up our parks and schools, libraries and neighborhoods the more people will also help to keep our planet clean.

I picked twenty hours because It is not to much time, but yet students still have a chance of doing what they want on the weekends. We have homework and school five days a week and homework that takes two hours and over and doing to much community service will give the students no life for fun. If I had picked 45 hours the students would have to fun and that's what childhoods all about. So twenty hours is not too much time and you can still have most of your weekends free but you are also helping to keep your community clean and to show that you are a good student at SCHOOL_NAME and that you care about your planet.

I hope you consider my argument. It shows what good students we are and how much we care but yet it helps us build up our lives and still lets us live the life we want.

Our school is a very complex school, with different varieties of personalities. Some people may find it relaxing to help others while some may not have the time to do so. Community service such as picking up litter on a busy high way or walking dogs for people who don't have the ability to do so would, in my opinion, builds character. Community service will help many others while making the students stop and realize that when you help people they may be helped in return. I think it would be a good idea to offer community service but I do not think it should be mandatory. Helping others is very important and will not only help the person the services are being provided for but also the helper. All and all school is a place for education some may debate , but along with education you need responsibility which some students lack. Maybe offer certain community services as extra credit. hold a meeting 1 day a week during study hall/ advisory, or after school for dedicated students to brainstorm various ways to help the community. As the principle and the final say in all school aspects I think it would be very rewarding to every one if we started community service as a school. It would also give the school a better name and more and more people would want to volunteer and help the school out. We could hold monthly annual field trips to various highways or if that may cause unnecessary commotion even a retiring home and visit with the elders. Any little thing could help. All students should want to help others but the reality is not all care as much as others. I think its important to instill the proper traits in school but its not just up to us. I propose that twice a week we go from class room and recycle old and unused paper. As for mandatory community services I don't think it should be, but I do think it would be very appreciated to many to offer community services to the population. Parents might even want to get involved and before you know it others will want to start. If you start with something minor and work your way up others will want to participation when they thinks its easy. My proposal to you is that we offer many different variates along with different time fames to offer our time and support of those who are willing and ready to perform acts of pure good deeds to further better our community. I also think that in America it only takes one person to make a change and with this i say it will catch on and America will be a better place to live, love, and work in peace.",3,Community service,Independent,0.4
715ECA916439,"Dear Principal,

I believe that community service should be purely voluntary. People may be too busy to take part in service, so it may be excusable. Though to get more volunteers, there may be an incentive formed to help them think of performing acts for the community. It may be more productive requiring the service, but what of those that still disagree with doing it? If it were required we would have much more punishment than what is necessary. That being said our society is growing less responsible, so those that take community responsibility on their own may only need to feel the pride of helping others. In my honest opinion it seems to me that if everyone were doing service, there may not be anything available for everyone to do. Organizing the services may also be too much of a hassle than it is worth, and above that how would we know if the people are really doing their duties? It seems to be psychological if the person would do service or not, and I think that it should be their decision to make things fair. It doesn't seem right morally to force people into service, even for their community.

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I have recently heard that your are deciding weather or not to make all students perform community service. I feel that if some student don't want to help their community why force them to.

If there are students that want to help make their community better you should let them keep doing what makes them happy and or proud. Look at it this way if you force someone to do something they wouldn't have a positive attitude about the whole process. I think since some students give back to help their community then you and or the school should give back to them. If others see that doing something positive like cleaning up litter or even tutor elementary school kids or even staying to help a teacher with some work they may need help with, then some students might get the feeling that they really want to help. I am not saying that everyone will react in the same way but I think it would be a more calmer approach, rather than trying to force a school of kids that may not want to spend extra time of their day doing more work. It will not be easy but as a teen I would say that positive feed back can really change the way people look at things. If you put yourself in a teenager's shoes you would see that some students after school really just want a break and take a load off for a couple of minutes instead of continuing working. I think to fix this problem we need one or even to positive students took set an example for our school to encourage the others to give back to the people that live around us and help us everyday in our lives by going to what every job they may have and doing what they have to do to make our lives easier and better.

I have an idea concerning community service.

You probably are considering to make everyone to do community service and I'm on the same track.

In my sight community service is essential.

Others may not have the time to do something they need done and we can help.

It is also much wiser to help someone in need rather than students at home playing video games or watching television.

Service helps you feel good inside and have better self esteem and may also help you physically.

There are many people around us that don't have the time to get things done that are very important.

Some single parents don't have time to work, do household jobs, and take care of their kids everyday.

We may not be able to help with their work but we certainly are able to help them with household things.

They would appreciate it and it will help them to feel more relaxed.

Instead of a mesmerized feeling that you get watching television or playing video games, you will have a happy and peaceful feeling inside.

That is much more rewarding.

Community service may also help you physically.

Hard work of cleaning or moving things is a way to be active.

The constant effort that you don't realize may be helping your strength and cardio.

Since we have an overweight problem in America it would actually help if we did more service.

Many people now days don't have very high self esteem.

When you do service for someone else they will probably thank you over and over and say how wonderful you are.

It might actually make you think twice about yourself and try harder because you know someone cares.

I think community service is very important for students to do because it helps other people, it helps you to become physically active, and it may raise your self esteem.

Even though people grumble about doing service it is really important that they do it.

In the end they will be glad they had the chance to do service for some other than themselves.      ",3,Community service,Independent,0.4
03004B5AD2CC,"I think making the students do community service is a great idea! Kids/teenagers need to learn responsibility and kindness while growing up by doing things for other people. I think it will make the kids a lot less selfish and want to help others when they get older and become young adults. Community service is great for teens of any age to learn how to care for someone else.

Good things that teens can do to help the community would be stuff like going outside and walking along the streets in their town and picking up litter. They could even go to the nursing home in their community or around their community and help the workers and the residents with anything they can. Students could even stay after school on certain days and help the janitor with anything he/she needs cleaned, or work in the concession stand during school sporting events. Maybe even the science teachers would like to help the students with starting a garden in a spot outside, we have plenty of room! The garden would supply food which could be given to homeless shelters or food pantry's.

I know that some of the students here already do community service for fun or even for projects for school, but I really think it would be a great idea for the school to meet up with some people that do community service and offer to have people to come and help them with it. They could possibly come weekly or even monthly and take a group of students out and do whatever they need them to help with. Community service is a good way for kids to learn to work with people and help their community. We should definitely do more of it around here! It would set good examples for other schools and maybe even help the environment!",4,Community service,Independent,0.6

Everyone is talking about you in school now.

They all think that you're going to force us all to do community service.

Personally, I think that it's a terrible idea.

Here's why...

Isn't community service supposed to be based on volunteer work?

It completely and utterly destroys the purpose of community service if you make the entire school do it.

Like other kids I know, we do not support all of the ideas of our community.

So why should be help?

Why should I want you help someone who is going to deny my gay and lesbian friends the right to marry?

Why?

Would you help a mass murderer throw away evidence just because he's your neighbor?

Also, what if someone gets hurt?

How is that going to look?

Here's an example of how someone could get hurt.

Let's say OTHER_NAME works at a homeless shelter.

And he wants some help to run it.

He calls you, and gets your approval to bring twenty-five into the shelter to work for one hour each.

I think that this is a terrible idea.

One, you're bringing little kids into a dirty and gross building that its more than likely filled to the brim with diseases.

And let's say that little OTHER_NAME gets attacked while he's there.

What do you think this would mean for the school?

News headline

: YOUNG BOY AT LOCAL SCHOOL ATTACKED ON COMMIUNITY SERVICE PROJECT.

What good would come out of this?

I think that if you want people to do community service, you should let them win prizes ever time they do community service.

Now some would say that it would be volunteering.

But when you think about it, how else are you going to get kids to work for their community?

I can assure you that this is the way to get children to work for their community.

To sum this all up, I think you should not make all of the children at this school work, and you should encourage them to work my offering prizes.

Teens today don't care about it because they want to do something fun like go watch a movie with friends or just hang out. Community and service can be fun as well. Teens should gather their friends to do community service. The bigger the group the more fun it will be. Weather it be raking leafs, planting trees or cleaning up a park everyone can hang out and can go home feeling good about it. Community service doesn't have to take up a lot of time maybe one day of the week you can set aside to doing something to help out the community.

It can also change the world if you help some one. Its also not a waist of time for them because your doing something important for someone ells. Also something you might want to do might not be that important. You might just be doing nothing instead you could help some one out or keep the world green and stop pollution. They can also raise money for children in need. for example if they need shoes so they will not be walking bear footed, also they can donate cloth they don't need anymore or want to the children who do really need them. They can also use the money they get to pay for children's doctor bills they could be saving some ones live. Over all i think it is a great thing to do for your self and for some one ells. Its also does not have to be something as big as that it can be something small and it will change the live or lives of some one ells.

the community service will keep kids busy because they need to be doing something constructive in their spare time instead of partying, watching television and playing violent video games.

also the community service will teach them the benefits of hard work because it will show them and help them get a perspective on by doing the smallest things what you can get accomplished.

and last but not least it will get them off the streets and have them doing something positive because if kids are at home and doing nothing they are likely to experiment with bad behavior. this can lead to them rebelling over there parents and sometimes getting thrown in jail.

I believe that every student should have to perform some type of community service because we should all give back to the community in one way or another or another, even if its just helping someone in their yard or going to a nursing home and sitting with the elderly just for them to have company.

We should perform community service so we can be prepared and ready for the world of work.

It would also be a good experience for us to help out in the community just to see what is going on in and around the community.

Community service would be a great idea because we could learn a lot about the people in our community and get to know them in a friendly and personal way.

It may take up lot of our spare time but I believe that it is worth it.

Community service is a great service to have on any applications for college and even when we are searching for a job after college.

Most businesses now hire workers that have experience and who have done community service. Also, we would become well respected and trusted if we have helped out and donated our time to help out around and in the community.

Helping out in the community would be a great thing for students who want to go to college and who want to achieve a decent , nice paying job in the future.

I want your students to do community service, like picking up litter or help someone to do community service.

They could help the planet if they do community service some examples are, picking up litter, recycling, reusing, donating, and reducing some of their stuff from home or from someone's house.

Recycling- you can recycle stuff like any kind of plastic bottles, paper, and glass so that your students will learn community service easier.

Reusing- you can reuse all of storage bowls and dishes that you barely use you and your students can go to like a lake and pick up litter, then they can start reusing some of it.

Donating- the stuff that your students have in their house, that they don't use anymore they can donate it to a really good charity for the poor or for the homeless, or if they have any little brothers or sisters they could get some of their old toys or something that they don't use anymore they could donate it like to a daycare or homeless children.

Reducing- you and your students can reduce about anything that you have in your household.

Littering- your students should not ever litter, because it would give the community some hard work and it would take up most of their social time with their families, so make sure that none of your students never litter any where.

I also think doing community service is a good idea because if people wants to exercise then they can get out and pick up some trash or help the environment by help cleaning peoples yard.

Some people cant get out and help because there not in shape or they might not have the strength to get out and help.

As you may know, there is a conflict involving whether students in our school should do community service or not. After taking my time, thinking about this conflict, I had come up with a solution. In my opinion, children of my age should be doing community service regularly because they can help the community, they spend more time outside rather than inside and it builds their character.

In modern days, the environment is very unclean. There is trash all over the place and there are people in the world who just do not appreciate the environment. People are littering and there is a big mess just about everywhere an average person walks. If we use their time to clean up these areas, the community would be much cleaner.

Some students are the indolent kinds and they do not do anything but lay down on their couch and play video games or watch television. But if these students do community service then they are more active whether its helping a teacher or cleaning a school yard.

When somebody does something to help someone, the will most likely will feel proud of themselves. That is when they build a better character. They build a larger self-confidence, self-esteem, and a better person within themselves.

When i walk outside, by myself, I always ask myself, what is a good way to make the world a better place, then i thought about community service, a light bulb struck my head.

I believe that you should have the students perform community service. I think that community service is very important but some of the other students think it is a complete waste of time. So I would like to add a ""trash clean-up"" project for the students who do nothing, or want to help out the school during recess time. It will be on or around campus during the lunch period for fifteen minutes a day. Then the next few days after the school is cleaned up, we should have ""reading buddies"" for students in preschool and kindergarten. it will give younger students a larger vocabulary, and give the older students higher social skills. I clean up the playground during recess, read to students, and I bake cookies for the elderly people at the local retirement home.

Helping in community service is way to encourage students to help out a lot more and keep students out of trouble. Doing community service shows that kids actually do care about their town and the environment they live in. For example if you live by a beach, and there is a lot of garbage, and no one helps pick it up, it can kill the poor harmless animals that might think its food. But if you have all the students help by doing community service it will all get cleaned and we can make sure there are no pieces left behind.

If you have all the kids help, maybe we can have an ice-cream day to repay us for all the hard work, so that everyone gets something good out of volunteering to community service. I myself do not like to clean anything, but i think community service would be a really good thing for some kids. And it's not only cleaning trash off the ground but also helping at the elderly home or tutoring kids at an elementary school, like reading books, or help planting trees around their school grounds. There is a wide variety of things to do.

If you don't want to make all the kids in the school do community service, then i think you should put up a sign up sheet for students who want to so they can sign up, and have a day or two every week were they leave school for a couple hours to go do some community service with some teachers that volunteers also.

Also, i think kids that get into fights or start trouble with teachers or their peers, should have to go without a doubt so they can learn a few things about being a bully.

Volunteering in community service is a great way to keep students out of trouble. If they have already been in trouble, then it well help them learn their lessons. Volunteering in community service looks really good on a record, and usually when you apply for a job there is a section that ask for volunteer work, so it could also help some kids get better jobs.

I was thinking that community service is very important to our society. Since we are in a Catholic school I think it would be a good idea to give back to our society. I am someone that enjoys volunteering because it leaves me with an accomplishment and just a good feeling for helping others.

People that volunteer get a couple good things out of it. First of all you get to help others and it might just be the smallest thing that you do to help people. One easy thing that would be very helpful is to help out a younger grade teachers for about a hour and just help the students read or write or anything that the teacher would need help with. It doesn't have to be hard labor just something to give back to the community.

Another way to help the community is to just pick up trash that isn't yours. I know that for some people it might be totally disgusting to pick up a piece of paper found on the floor but you don't want the whole world to be filled with trash. So I think just simple things could make the world a better place.

With wanting to make the world a better place I think that community service should be required for school. I also think it would look good on our permanent record for collage and high school.

I don't want to make it back breaking labor but, maybe just something to make a difference in my life and others. I know it might sound crazy because i am just in 8th grade but even the smallest person can make a difference in life even if its just picking up a piece of paper.

So if the principal wants to make everybody do it then why doesn't he do it. So the people that want to do it go ahead and help the your community. But the people that don't want should not be forced to do it.

Community service is optional for those that want to and don't want to.

I want to make a garden so I can pick out the vegetables and serve it in the soup kitchen for those who are in need.

So i could start out with one vegetable, and make it a garden. I would pick my fellow classmates to help me out in my garden, or my neighbors. I would plant vegetables or fruits like carrots, and cabbages, and strawberries, oranges, kiwis, and potatoes. Then pick them out and clean them and serve it in the soup kitchen.

I would really like to help out in the soup kitchen, and feed the others in need.

It would really great to help out. Here we are eating anything ,and they are starving for food that they cannot get.

So I suggest we help them out with good, healthy, food.

I think that this would really help out, and make it even useful to others. Providing food for those who are in need.

F8ABA40201AB,"Dear TEACHER_NAME, all students should be required to perform community service. This is a great idea because this way students can earn credit points for college, they help their society, and they give good examples to others while socializing more. With community service requirements, it s a win-win situation.

If all students had to participate in community service, they can earn credit points when they go to, or if they are in college, these types of things demonstrate to colleges that their alumni are actually interested in what happens in their surrounding environments, community service in most colleges is thought of as an extracurricular activity. Many universities would appreciate to have a student that does extracurricular activities, especially if those services are ones that help their surroundings.

Secondly, these requirements involve students helping their commonwealth to become a better place. By removing litter from the streets, they help the earth, by reading to young children, the help the people, by volunteering with animals they help nature as well as many other different activities that can be done to help the general public and the world as a whole. Students and families can benefit from such generous actions performed by others.

Finally, mandatory community is a good thing because students can give other people good examples as to what should be done. With students helping out this much, other people can see their effort, and they might also pitch in and help too. Another good thing is that while performing their activities, students can become more social with one another, and they might learn things about their other colleagues that they never knew.

Community service should be a mandatory thing for everyone, not just students but its best to take things slowly. Everyone can benefit from these acts for example, they help students build up a good reputation for college, they contribute to society and the world, and lastly, they present good actions to other people while helping kids with their socializing. Having students perform community services is an amazing idea and it brings great opportunities for the present and the future.",4,Community service,Independent,0.6
C1528CD20761,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Community service is definitely a very important thing all over the United States. We must keep our environment clean, healthy, and looking nice for whoever's eyes it draws. Not only that, but helping out young children at elementary schools, gardening over the city, and more help really makes a person feel good and accomplished. Although community service should be mandatory to some people, I believe it should be an option. No one should be forced to clean the city, but if they wanted to, they absolutely could.

To begin, a principal shouldn't make all students provide community service, it should be out of wanting to. For that reason, I think the students that help around the city, schools, etc. should be somehow rewarded. Not everybody wants to take time out of their day to help the environment, and I don't think it would be right if they were forced to either. I'm not saying nobody should help out, I'm just that we should do it out of our own will. It takes personal time away from being with our friends and family while we're not at school, and doing other activities with the ones we love. That is time that shouldn't be taken away from what a principal just decides to do. Like I mentioned, students should be rewarded for their actions of community service because if nobody else is doing it, at least they are. That shows care and responsibility for where they live and who sees it.

To conclude, it surely would make the world a beautiful place if principals required community service to all students. It just wouldn't make all the students and parents happy for reasons such as personal time being taken away, and more. It would be pointless then. Otherwise it is great, it just should not be a required thing.

First I think that SCHOOL_NAME should be a loud to pickup trash from the community. Other childern want to do something fun like plying games ,talking with they friends and other thangs they like to do. community service need to be only for voliters or craminals

I also think that the craminals will have something to do. even they will be picking up garbith they will be happy to be out of jeil. TO volatier they have to wear old cloths. they have a seartan time for them to be done. if they are bord at home they can ask the people to do more work with the community service. the people will tell them what ever they want. then the volienters will go home or stay there ware they are at.

E940448E4323,"Well i think students should do community service because it will keep their mind active. Also they will be focus on there work in school and in the service. If a student does not do community service they will not focus on there work and they will be playing all the time. For example if a student does community service they will be focusing on the work and not play, they will also concentrate on homework. When a student does not do community service they will not focus on there work that they will have to do. The students that don't do community service will almost be playing outside with their friends and not the work they are suppose to do. If a student does not want to do community service then maybe they have an after school program that helps them.

When you do community service you don't have to do it all day some of the community services have a time to see how long you can stay. Also you can decide whether to help on weekdays or weekends so that you have time for school work. If you do help your community with like picking up litter, helping kids, or others then your community will look like a nice place for everyone.

When you don't help your community like help cleaning trash then your community will look like a dirty place to live in.

If you don't want to do community service then its up to you if you want do it. If you decide not do it then maybe you have an after school program that helps you with things you need done in school.",2,Community service,Independent,0.2

I believe that requiring us to have community service is a good idea. One of my reasons for thinking this is a good idea is because its teaching us kids how not just help people in our friends group or at home but reaching out to our community. If kids didn't want to do community service or in better words not help people then we could show them that its not only helping other individuals but its helping ourselves I remember when my brother was in high school and he had to have a certain amount of community service hours one thing he did was help at the salvation army and i remember him coming home and telling my mom and dad thank you for all the things they do for him and buy him and let him do things. At first I didn't really understand what was going on but now that I it changed him, it opened his eyes to a new era i guess you could say it showed him that he doesn't always need to think of himself but he needs to think of other people as well.

Another reason I think community service should be required is because it shows people that younger students care. Whenever I go and stay the night at my Grandmas i always help her clean and do the laundry etc... but what I'm saying is that she likes that i will help her when she needs it, and I have a good attitude about it. I make this statement because what if one of the jobs we do is helping people and we go to an assisted living home we help people there and it shows them that we care for them and that we haven't forgot them.

My last reason is that its getting us ready for the real world. When we grow up we will have to help people in every day situation whether its at our jobs or even at a store we always are helping people and doing things for people if you require us to have community service I believe that it would let people see in a new perspective, so my position on this statement is to require the performance of community service.",3,Community service,Independent,0.4

I think all students should be required to take community service. Taking part in doing community service would be helpful to our environment and other people. Some students should help by teaching little children helpful things. They can teach them how to read and write. This would help them by improving their levels in learning. Students should also do community service to help clean our community. A lot of people throw garbage everywhere not caring. Students can help by cleaning it up. This can help our community be clean and less polluted.

Helping old people would also be helpful. They can help take care of them in some ways and help by keeping their room clean for them. Old people, might like this because they get to see new people and enjoy being with a new person and not get bored all day. Another thing that they can help at is being helpful to kids that have a disability. They can play with them, teach them new things and help them in what they need. Doing this would really be helpful to those kids. Making the students in taking part in community service should be a great idea. Students helping out benefits many people, which is a good thing. This can make us experience new things. Most students stay home and do nothing, but they can really be helpful taking part in community service.

AF6254DD5494,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As you may know, many elementary schools have begun to include student community service in their required curricular.

In my opinion, our school should have community service available, but not a requirement.

There are many pros and cons of this idea, but I sincerely believe this is something you should think about.

Nowadays, schools have a very wide variety of different extra curricular activities available for students to part take in.

Students have become very occupied and busy because of them, but they are excellent in enriching students' minds academically and physically.

I believe that our school should add to our wonderful list of extra curricular activities, and have community service as an option for students.

Having community service would not only help others, but the students would have a chance to see how helping others and the community can be satisfactory and fun.

Instead of just being taught about going out in the world and making a difference, we can actually live out what we are taught.

Physically performing what we have learned is taking school to the next level.

Students would be obtaining knowledge on discovering ways in which performing a task meant to assist others can be enjoyable.

Some students or faculty will indefinitely be opposed to this suggestion.

They may feel that adding community service to our curricular would be taking away from other clubs and/or teams the school has been supporting for years.

What they do not understand, is that nothing would be taken away.

Community service is something that everyone should be taking part in, not just when our parents force us to or taking a once-a-year field trip to the park to pick up litter.

It should be part of our lives in general.

Like I said before, this would, in no way, shape, or form be forced upon the students to do.

It is merely an excellent chance to provide students with an experience that could possibly change their lives for the good.

My opinion on community service may not and will not agree with everyone.

Not every idea does.

In fact, most of them do not.

The majority of Americans did not support Martin Luther King's beliefs on race equality, but look where America is now.

Obviously, community service for an elementary school cannot compete with Dr. King's campaign, but they are alike.

Community service has the potential to change our school.

Please consider this suggestion and thank you so much for your time!

I think that community service would be a good idea. It would help people out that are less fortunate then us. It would help elderly people or people that can't do much. It would also maybe help us learn about how lucky we actually are to have a house, and clothes, and food to eat everyday.

It would be a good idea but a lot of people wouldn't wanna do it. So if you made it small things or things that didn't take a lot of time to do then it would probably work. And maybe like each month if you got a certain amount of hours or did a certain amount of things then you could get a prize. I think more people would do that if they knew they could get a prize.

Plus you shouldn't tell the kids when they have to do it, you should let them pick because a lot of kids have sports like me. And when i get out of practice I'm tired so I would not wanna have to do community service. And a lot of kids are busy so letting them decide when to do it would be a good idea. And that would encourage more people to do it.

We could do such things as rake leaves, shovel snow, help out elderly people with needs, or even pick up trash on the road. We could even do things here in our school like help stack books in the library, help pick up trash in the hall ways, or even help clean up the lunch room on Fridays like some people do.

In conclusion I think it would be a good idea and many people would benefit from this. I think that it would also change our lives as well as many people that we would be helping. We would also be making our community a better place to live in and many people would be thankful for our help.",3,Community service,Independent,0.4
4819AB11D62A,"Well, I think that students should have community service because it will help people and make them feel happy. If you go to the nursing home and help the old people, they will feel very good. If you pick up trash from the side of the road, then people in the community will think that you did a good job. Then the community will be pretty.

Everything you do for the people at the nursing home feel good when you do something for them. Their children might not come and visit them and help them. So they want to be really happy if their about to die or their really sick. You will also feel good after you do something good for them.

The community should look very nice because what if someone famous comes to the community. What will they think? They'll probably think that the students or adults don't do anything for the community. So not just juveniles should pick up the trash for the community. High school students and adults should just volunteer to pick up trash on the side of the road. instead of getting paid for it.

Volunteer work is about helping people and helping the community. It's not about helping people or the community and getting paid for it. Some famous people do volunteer work.

94AB35E81587,"Dear Principal,

I think that community service is a great thing. Some people love to do it and others, not so much. Depending on what your job is; it can be complex or easy. People have different opinions on this, but I think that there should be a certain amount of time needed each day for community service. Doing a community service job each day means commitment, time management, and focus. Doing these jobs builds character, adds to your job application, and helps with your social/emotional and physical feelings.

Like I said, not everybody likes community service. But doing it can help make you a better person. Doing a job for your community will help make it a better place and a happier place. For example, if your community has a lot of trash, and you pick it up, it now looks nicer and more well kept. This can give you a good feeling and a good relationship to you and your neighbors. If people did things like this every day, this world could completely change for the better.

I said that community service can help your job application. The cool thing is it can! Having jobs, even community service, can look great on a resume. It can lead to opening doors for other, better jobs. For example, if you wanted to join a job and it was between you and another guy, but you had community service for a previous work place/job, and he had nothing, who do you think would get the job? You! Even a small thing like community service can lead to great things in life.

Doing community service can help build character. But on top of that, it helps build emotional and physical strength. Doing community service helps with emotional strength, because you can meet new people as friends, and you can talk to people about things you like to do. Did you know, that emotional strength helps keep you at your highest for physical strength? So just being happier with new friends could make you feel a bit better physically!

So, overall, I'm saying one thing. YES! There should be a required amount of time for community service in our schools. Please take this into consideration, because I'm challenging you (Mr./Mrs. Principal) to have us students make this earth we live on a better place. Community service, is just one way we can help.",4,Community service,Independent,0.6

First i want you to know that is a good thing that you thing of that but if students don't want to help and you sent them do something i think they are going to make it worst. EX: you sent them to go pick up trash and they go and they are just playing around they are going to be fighting with the trash throwing it where it was clean then later when they finish playing they are going to see a mess that they are going to get lazy and just walk away and go to another place where its cleaner and if they are trouble makers they are going to do that over and over again.

Think about it if you let students that really want to help out and they do the same thing (throw the trash to each other) and if they really want to help out they are going to clean for them selves. and they are going to be helping because they want to ,not because you forced them to do community service.

Dear Mr. Principal,

Community service to me is something that everyone should be a part of. It's good to help people who need help or deserve help. Community service is good because you get an opportunity to help others in need. Some people just need someone to talk to, or they need a friend. You only get a couple of opportunities to actually do something for the community. When you get to do something for the community you can also have a chance to show God's love to a person who could use a little bit of God's love. Some people just don't know where to get God's love, but you can help them get a little taste of love when you do something nice for the community.

I definitely don't think that community service is a waste of time. Community service is something that you can do for the Lord. Community service can usually only take a couple of hours from your day. Community service can also change some ones life. It's nice to do something for the community. Community service is not just a waste of time it is a way to show people that you care about them, and love them. It's also okay if it takes just a few hours away from your day, it's important to show people God's love for them.

Serving the community is something that everyone should be a part of. Everyone should have a chance at some points in their life to show community service to people. If no one shows community service, then how will we show God's love to others? God put us on this earth to tell people about Him. Our job isn't just to sit around a t home and watch television. We're actually supposed to get of the couch, and go get God's word out to people who need it. Some people will never get a chance to experience God. We might just be about the only people ever to tell them about God. We can even get a chance to witness to them, and lead them to the Lord.

Yes, Mr. Principal, I do think that everyone should be a part of Community Service, because it is a chance to actually change the community. We can change some ones life by just doing a small act of service. You definitely should make everyone do community service. We need to get God out into our communities. Everyone needs to be able to get a chance to go to heaven. We need to get out there, and help people!",4,Community service,Independent,0.6

Community service is both a punishment and a voluntary action. Some convicts must go through it because of a crime they commit, and some do it to help the community. In my opinion, I think we should allow those people to do the service. Time is important to a teen; especially on school days. We should not be required to do community service, for we have very little time as it is now.

Middle school ends at 4:15, which is later than high school and elementary school. Although it may seem like a long time to rest, it isn't enough for many students. Many students have sports that use up that time. Others may have music lessons or extracurricular school activities. Adding community service to our schedules will take up much of the time we use to relax after a long day at school.

Friends are a big part of a students life.

Although texting and calling is becoming much more popular, lots of people still want to see their friends face to face. Friends can help you if you're sad, they support you, and they keep you entertained. If community service is required, many won't get to see or talk to their friends as often as they'd like to.

As you can see, community service could have an impact on students. It could make the community better, but at the same time it will make students miserable. Time is limited in a middle school student's life. Depriving them of that takes away many advantages of being young. I do not think that community service should be required in middle school.

Dear TEACHER_NAME;

Many students argue that community service is nothing that requires them, but many adults and some students feel it is an important part of our world, and it's an activity that everyone can participate in. Everyone needs to help change the world, and I agree that community service is a big deed that students should be taking a part of, but a lot of students claim they don't have enough time. Doing little things like walking your neighbors dog, or help babysit your cousins is enough for students who have extracurricular activities, and boat loads of homework. Many students do participate in community service, and many also do extracurricular activities.

The main reason students say that they cannot participate in community services is because they play sports, or are on the dance team, or in English festival. They participate in something extracurricular, therefore they don't have the time between games and practices to balance out there schedule and their grades.

The students grades are another important reason to either decide if or if you cannot participate in community services, let alone extracurricular activities. I think if there is a student or students who do not participate in any extra activities, and keep there grades up, I think they can be a part of community services, as well as other students who participate in the activities, outside of school hours. I think the school should have a sign up sheet which requires every student to sign up for a community service. Now, not all community services are giving away food to the homeless, it's a simple thing such as tutoring a younger student, or cleaning up the lunchroom so all the volunteers who prepared the lunch don't have another burden on their shoulders.

I think all students should do something for the community not just at home, but maybe the school can volunteer and help with the community service. Every student should do at least 2 community services. Maybe one at home and one at school. Just because some kids are complaining that they have to much homework or to many practices doesn't mean that they can't throw in a little extra time for the community. Go to study hall or try to get some of your work done in school, instead of talking. If you are struggling with school work, then try to focus on that and then go towards the community services once your ready and caught up with school work.

Now my opinion is that all students should participate in some sort of community services and still be able to balance out there grades and conflicting schedules. Everyone needs to be flexible, and try to help out the community for a change. It should be required, and every student should be able to handle a little community services.

I firmly believe that all students should be required to perform community service. The act of serving others helps individuals learn how to be compassionate, caring, and better citizens. Many students already, have contributed to the community by tutoring elementary students and participating in local trash clean-ups. However, some students believe that community service is a waste of time. So, I am going to inform you that it is not.

Tutoring younger students is an example of community service that helps people, other than ourselves. It helps younger students with their homework or questions, and it provides a role model in their life. If a younger student was taught by a person they looked up to then, when that child grew up, they could do the same. They would tutor younger kids just like their role model. This is a positive act, because, their would me more educated kids in our community.

Another community service is trash clean-ups. They may not sound like fun, but they help keep the community clean and beautiful. If more kids in our school picked up a piece of trash in our school or the whole community, the world would be a little cleaner. Cleaning is not that hard either, but kids have to be motivated and with the requirement of community service, they would be.

This whole letter is to try to convince you to try to make that requirement of community service, but it wouldn't be fair if i only showed you one side of the story. A lot of kids would rather be playing video games or watching t. v. in their spare time, but community service does not take a lot of time. Picking up trash in the halls in between classes , or answering a question is considered community service. It only takes a minute! If you make community service a requirement then, we would see more good deeds every day. The community would be a better place and we students, will become better everyday citizens.",5,Community service,Independent,0.8

I believe that all students should be required to perform community service. Being active participants of community service will help students stay or become well rounded. Community service could better the way our towns and cities look. It would also give student an idea of what they would be required to do in high school and college.

I believe community service is a positive influence on all students. Just because it would take up some of students time doesn't mean it will take up all of their time.

Many students are lazy and complain they have nothing to do, if those same students could put there time and effort towards community service their perspectives would be changed.

You should not require SCHOOL_NAME students to perform community service because that does not have anything to do with school or education. Also we have other things we could be doing in our spare time that are more useful and a better use of our time. The only reason That I think would be a good reason to require us to do community service is if we had bad behavior or bad grades. What you could do is have voluntary groups and activities that involve doing community work. That would be a good idea because some students who would like to do community work could sign up and do it. Other than that I do not see a very good reason to require us to do community work.

Well I noticed that you have been deciding whether to make students do community service or just to keep it as an option. In my opinion, it think you should make it mandatory for students to do community service. I know that some kids have other after school activities, and others don't. So I think the ones who just go home after school and just do homework should do community service. All they're going to do at home is sit down and watch television, play video games, or go on the computer.

All the students that don't play after school sports or any other activities should do at least five hours of community service in a school week. This will help the kids be more active and want to play sports. The kids probably wouldn't want to do community service will maybe start playing sports.

I realize that you have been wondering if you should require all students to perform community service. In this letter i am going to give my opinion on what i think. In my opinion, i think you should make all students perform some type of community service. I think this is a good idea so that students will be more involved in their community and so that our community will become a better one.

First, i think this is a good idea because students will be more involved in their community. For example, if students all come together to work they will become more aware of their own homes. Students may even meet new people and get to know more people who live in the area.

Second, this is also a good idea because our community will improve. With more people volunteering and helping our community will improve. One thing that could happen is our area will become cleaner. Because of this, there could be more people walking or more business.

Lastly, i would like to explain that i also think that not every student should participate in certain community service. I think this because sometimes not all students may have time to help with bigger service. Some students may not even want to help. I think that we should only let people that are willing to help perform community service help with bigger projects. I hope that this letter means something and it is taken under consideration.

I think that we should have a sign up sheet for the people that want to do the community service. For example maybe some of my friends don't want to and some of them do? Then the ones that want to can and the ones that don't then they don't have to. So that's why i think we should have a sign up sheet.

Another one could be have a vote to see how much people want to do community service. And those people can do community service and the ones that don't want to do community service don't have to. And everyone is happy for what they don't have to do community service or wants to do community service. And the people who do wants to do community service just have to tell them the information like what to do where to meet at and what time to what time. And that's why i think we should have a vote in every class.

I feel that to be successful in life you have to help other people. Community service is a great way to get kids involved in other things rather than sitting at home and playing video games, or watching T.V. being active in your community is also something that would look great on a college application. It's kind of a win-win scenario. Think about it, what if you were stuck at home and had nothing to do? Most kids would say well I can go to the movies and see the same movie that I've seen a million times to squash my boredom. but i would say that you should go help pick up some trash at the park or, Help your next door neighbor with their homework. That would be the right thing to do.

Community service is also a good way to build character. It helps you to feel like you are worth something. If you help clean up a dirty lake and find out that you saved 100's of fish and wildlife, it is going to boost your confidence. Kids at school would rather just be in a clique or hang out with ""the cool kids"" to help themselves feel good, but hopefully they will learn that helping someone feels ten times better than making other kids feel bad. Sometimes, kids take advantage of people and make them do things that they don't want to do to make themselves feel good. That is not something that anyone wants to feel. I think that getting kids involved their community would be a good way to help them with school, home life, your confidence level, and even your attitude. But, most importantly it will help other people around your community.

I have told you my opinion and that is all that I can do because now it is your turn to decide what should be done. Should we leave kids to play video games all day, or should we get them active and help boost their confidence level. I hope you will do the right thing and choose the second one but if not, I know that i can't do anything about it. By requiring community service you will be helping these children greatly. It would provide A healthy and bright future for them to grow on.

Supporting our community is very important, but it also takes time away from what the person wants to do. The main reason there isn't much volunteering is that many people are to lazy or selfish to do the work needed. So if we have volunteers come out there probably wouldn't be enough people to get any work done. This is the reason I would make them volunteer.

The first reason they should help is that its good for them to do a little work every now and then. For example, if you go out a pick up trash you will probably get a lot of sun to your skin which gives you vitamin D. This could also help kids understand how good it makes you feel to work on something to make it better.

The next reason is that it would help the community by making it better for the people including the workers. For example, if a traveler comes through your town and sees that its clean, they will probably stop and think ""wow how nice this place is"", making our town look good. It would make the place look a lot cleaner and more respectable. Also it would make the town notice how much good you have done and might help out the next time.

The final reason is that it would get you a good name to your friends and the people all around your town. They could also see you doing good and understand you can be trusted with work. This might help out when they need to trust you with a job.

So all of the reasons spoke about can help you with your decision. But, I would definitely go with the option on making them do some work then see how many wants to help again. This is all, thank you for you time and consideration.

1F5A8C38324F,"I think that helping the community is important but I believe that it might interfere with other things that you need to do, like having a part-time job or schoolwork. So I think that performing community work could get in the way of other things that you need or want to do.

Performing community work is great and all, but what if some students have things to do or want to do but they cant because they have to help with community services? What if they have a part-time job that they must attend to or babysit their little siblings or even the neighbors kids? What if someone has to do a school project that could take hours to do and its due the next day? What im getting at is that people have things that they must do in life, and might not always be able to help with the community work. Helping out is great and all but people have lives outside of school and might not always be there to help with the community work.

So where I stand is that im against students doing community work, for they might have some things that might have to attend to first. Its not always easy to commit to something that you might not be able to follow through with, so this why I am against it.      ",2,Community service,Independent,0.2

I think that not everyone should have to do community service. I think that because if people would rather do other personal things that they would like to do on their time i do not think that it is fair to make them do community service when they do not want to. Also I do not think that kids should be required to do community service because many children have very busy schedules with school sports and many other extra activities in and out of school. So i don't think that it is fair to make children do community service when there schedule is to full to do it. Another reason why I don't think that community service should be mandatory is because some kids already helped out by doing some things in school so I think that it should be their choice whether they would like to participate in community service or not.

But with all of that being said I think that those children who do participate in community service and helping our environment. For example at SCHOOL_NAME, if someone helps out with community service they should receive a pride coupon for helping and giving back to our environment. So I think that if the children are generous enough to take some of their time out of their day to help the environment they should be awarded with something special in all schools across the United States.

I think that helping out our community is a great thing but I do not think that we should have to force kids to help the environment if they are not doing it for all of the right reasons and just doing it so that they could go home and play their video game but like I said before I think that all of the children who do help out with giving back to our environment should be thanked for what they have done for our country.

I hope that I have made a point and thank you for giving me this opportunity to right to you and express my feelings about community service and we should deal with it.

Community service is a very good plan , community services need more reliable citizens to depend on . Community service doesn't actually have to be just cleaning up litter , community service can be helped in many ways , Such as Cleaning up Beaches , streets/parks , or helping at an after school program . Community service is a very good idea .

Some Beaches are usually filled with Dirty Garbage that people leave behind when there on their vacations . At beaches you see bear bottles , can's of soda's , plates , and even wrappers that can affect our environment and animals . Streets are full with things that people throw out of their cars even if its against the law . Littering our streets can be a big conflict to our drivers , anything can happen to the wheels while there driving . Parks can be a fun place for kids to spend their time but also there dirty with candy wrappers , ice cream wrappers all these sort of things should be improved to help in our community .

Middle School teenagers are more active , and have more time then these adults . Most teenagers do not work , these teenagers have time to spend on helping our community . Some of my friends think that Community service is a waste of time , that they have better things to do then just pick up garbage , i used to think that i picked up enough garbage at home . But when i realized and asked about community service , my room is nothing compared to the garbage out there in just one street block . It's their decision to perform community service if they want to or not .

Helping in an after school program can be very fun for teenagers . They can get to show kids and give them a heads up on what high school is like . teenagers can volunteer to help students after school on their homework , problems and for the best part they can also at the same time get their High-school hours . Kids will have fun play and learn things everyday from these Community programs .

These are some of hundreds of ways that teenagers can be part of Community services , they can ask questions or find put more by searching what community service is like .It can make a Big change in their lives .

I understand that you are trying to make our community better with community service ,but forcing students to do this I believe is not right. Some students wish to do community service but do not have the time to do so.

They might have a job after school, or have to take care of younger siblings. Also after school is a time when children like to hang out with there friends and family. Children also take time after school to do homework and relax after a hard day at school. Children who are a little slower might ask teachers for help after school as well and if they where forced to do community service there grades might suffer. My friends and I hang out after school and help each other with our homework ,if we had to do community service we would be able to help each other with our homework and would never get to hang out. For those people who have to watch younger siblings after school the might get in trouble with parents and there younger siblings would have to stay home alone. Students who are slower wouldn't be able to stay after school and there grades would suffer because the don't get the help they need.

Some students love doing community service when they have the time but some children never have time to do community service. This is why i think forcing children to do community service is a bad idea you never know what will happen to one student there grades could fall, they might loose friends, the could get nerves, and some would never have time to hang out with family's.

Have you ever had to clean up other peoples trash off the side of the street, clean up dog poop from someone else's lawn, or had to walk across the beach and pick up cans, paper, bottles, and any other garbage that has been left at the beach. If you have good for you but not all people need or want to help the community. I think that we should leave community service up to the volunteers and people who got sent to community service by law. Instead of having everybody do it at the school. You could have everybody that gets in trouble do it as a punishment. Why would you have everybody do it when you could have people that want to do it do it so there is no complaining. I think that if there is complaining there will be fighting and that will just cause trouble. Not everyone wants to do community service so only have the people that want to do it help the community or else everyone else is going to complain and not follow the rules so there would be more people getting in trouble. When more people get in trouble the schools rating will go down and less people will go to that school so do you really want that? I'm guessing not especially if your the principal. So only have the people that want to do it do it so there are less fights and the school rating doesn't go down.

I think it is a great idea for our students to perform community service. We always talk about why the trees aren't growing, why our grass is dying as well, and why the population isn't doing so well! There is your answer, its because we let things just sit around on the ground and it effects our environment. Whether students have better things to do they should, want to help out with our community.

It would be good for us to do research on. To see how coke cans, snack bags after snack, seeing people throwing things outside the window as they ride by. Did you know that a paper bag can effect the environment? Would you want to walk around and see trash everywhere? You see people out on the side of the roads picking things up, I think we should get out there and do the same. Some of our students, well most, don't realize that its bad for us to inhale the bad aroma. Nobody's environment is perfect, but we all know that there is always room for improvement. Our teachers, could make up a project and let us tell the class what we learned from community service?

I also think it would be great because we can set good examples for other people and show other people that you can miss out on your weekend plan every once a while and put our community first for a change. On television, we see people gathering around and planting flowers, and recycling. That is another great way to help, is to recycle. My little cousin watches ""Disney Channel"" and there are always shows that come on when people are picking up trash from hurricanes and things that are being polluted. There are many ways to help around, doing the simplest things, its just the thought that counts. Sometimes my little cousin and I go walking around and just to help people we pick up things, anything that we see, that is polluting the area.

I think this is a great thing to do. We can learn so many things. We always talk about how we can't wait for summer and spring to come, so we can go outside. Well while we are outside we can help and just pick up things. Maybe field trips could occur while doing this. Then, people who are really involved then maybe we can have a club. I think, honestly, this is a great thing to do. I am here to help 100%. I hope we end up doing it.",4,Community service,Independent,0.6

I think it is a good idea for the student's to be in community service. It will help the environment so the earth can be healthy. I knew a friend that was in community service in 2009 he now lives in Rosemont, Illinois he picked up trash all over were he lives. But some of the students don't want to do something like this to prevent gases of pollution on earth.

I have been trying to make people under stand what it mean's to help. They don't want to help because they just want to litter throw can's not recycle or any thing to help. What I need are some people that care to do some of the community service. Take Disney's friend for change they are helping kid's unpollute there town's or cities.

What we really need are some special people to help for this community service one's that care for there planet. these crises on our planet need to stop all what they have done. i have received a letter from my friend that moved to Illinois has cleaned up the whole city with some help in just 1 month. If you know any one who can help with this call.

This is my idea what we should do to help our community. I now like to other people to see what life really mean's to us. We need miracles in Fayette county to help. I believe that we can do it. Just one more thing will you take a stand.

I think students should take a part of community service hours because every one should help in everything in our town. So i will take the position of people having to do community service hours. students should because the have to help the world be a better place. Others made mistakes and now should help clean up if they did litter. Some people like to help other kids in homework or learn other things like have difficult times so I say we should. Some of my friends think that this takes to much of our time but it is fun when you see what you did and people with happy faces it makes me feel happy inside.

So would you just let people do community service hours and let them understand what it means to help out the world.

As a student of this school, I believe it is very necessary to require community service at our school, although many students will not appreciate this, in the long run they will learn to appreciate what they are given and begin to act less selfish and more selfless. Community service will also give them a sense of accomplishment and more responsibility, this will indeed create a busy lifestyle therefore not giving time to do unnecessary or harmful things to themselves of the student body. This act of community service will allow all students to learn and experience new things and better themselves for their future.

I also believe the school administration should create a presentation showing students that this can be indeed a very fun task! For example, if a students enjoys pets' he/she can volunteer at their local pet adoption area. Maybe their is a student who would love to become involved with children or seniors, they may sign-up to help out at a local church, daycare center, pre-k, or nursing home. There are even ways for kids who would like to be a part of the entertaining world to get involved!

Students can get involved in their community in countless ways weather its piking up trash or reading books to a small child, there are only 3 steps to community service... 1)Find out what you would like to do 2) Sign-up for it and 3) Do it and have a blast!

Our community probably doesn't look as mush as perfect as you see it. There's a lot of people out there that throw trash around or don't cut the grass from abandoned buildings. I've been thinking that is maybe the time to step it up and get all the students to at least to an hour of community service.

You should probably require students to do community service. I mean, it's for the community to look better. I did that in sixth grade and I can do it my last year here too. It's not a really fun experience but I'm going to do it for other people to be thankful of me too.

We should probably start by a Saturday instead of being at home bored not getting you anywhere. Starting by groups seems like a good start I would enjoy that.

Another excellent time would be in the summer. It's practically when more people go out and go by our community. It will look really nice if we would do a little clean up to it. Please, get us students to that job. It doesn't take time away from me, I could see my friends another time.

I have been informed that you like the idea of community service.

I also think it is a good deed and does help our city in may ways.

I have in the past performed community service and i did enjoy it. it has been brought to my attention that you would like all student to be required to perform community service.

I believe this is a very good idea and that this can help kids have more pride of their community.

Some of my fellow classmates do not think community service would be good.

They believe this would take away some of their time to do things they want to do.

This may be true, but a little time for community service wouldn't hurt anyone.

Also, community service can vary in different ways.

Some forms can be tutoring or teaching, and other can be cleaning or picking up litter and even volunteering.

I do believe community service would be a good requirement for students. It could them out of trouble and could even help the people in our city.

I do believe however there should also be a small reward for their deeds. This could make kids want to help out more if they know there is a reward for their hard work.

Another benefit of community service is that it can help you in the future.

Volunteering can help you get into a better college or help you when applying for scholarships.

In conclusion, my opinion would be to require some form of community service, there are many rewards that come out of helping another person or your own city.

I find this would be a very rewarding idea, and volunteering could also help someone in there future. This idea is very good one and should be made a requirement for the years to come.

Here is what I think about having every student participate in community service. I think you should not have everyone participate in community service because of several reasons. First, some students have to babysit siblings or neighbors, community service will not allow them to do this, and some parents will be angry at that. Another reason is sports, many students participate in sports after school and cant skip games or practice, because the coach and parents will be mad. The last and most important reason is homework, this will not only angry the parents but the teachers as well. Students wont be able to complete all their homework assignments if they have to participate in community service. a solution to this is to have a certain selection of students that have bad grades and let them do community service as a form of extra credit, how can a student or parent e angry at that, you are bringing their grade up. another possible solution is to have a survey of kids who do nothing after school, and make them do community service. kids that don't do anything will most likely be happy if they have to do community service, 1 they're helping the community, and 2 they're being productive. That is what I think about all the students doing community service, and please take some thought on your decision. Think about the students and their parents when you make your decision.

I think we should all do community service because it helps kids stay out of trouble. It also allows us to meet new people and make new friends. Some kids think community service is boring or tiring but it can be fun and if they see the fun in it they would look forward to coming to school every day. Every day when some kids get out of school they end up doing things they shouldn't and get in trouble for it too.

When kids do community service and they like it they continue to do it even knowing that they don't have to. Community service changes a lot of kids and they would then stop doing what's wrong and do what's right. Like for example this one kid who would never help people had to do community service.

We have students here at SCHOOL_NAME, who need, and I'm sure would like, some tutoring. We have plenty of well educated students here, that I'm sure would have no problem with helping the ones who need it.

Volunteering looks great on a college application too! I don't think some students realize that colleges look for this kind of stuff. Maybe some fliers about that, might do some good to.

Picking up garbage is a great way to volunteer, and to support our Eco

I honestly think that the idea of having All students perform community service may be a good idea, but it can also not be a bad idea. There are some students who think the same and want to do the same as others, but there are other students who don't express themselves in that kind of way. Students should have a right in deciding what they want to do.

One reason that this is a good idea is because, if we all work together at this just as a school our world would be a better place just with the help that the kids are supporting our country. It is also a good idea because this can be an opportunity to show kids that there is something we can do to make a change, and we can all be apart of it and still make a big difference. Another reason this is a good idea because it can show kids that instead of being on the computer, or watching t. v , or even sleeping at home we can make a big change, and some students don't realize that.

But, one reason this is a bad idea is because students like to express themselves in anyways possible, maybe they don't like to tutor elementary school students, or clean up liter that is not there's. Like me for example I have so many ways of expressing my self. For example I love writing i can write all day, i also like being on the web and home and texting. But by this stuff that i am doing i can also make a change without doing community service. For example because i like writing so much i can write a letter to a animal shelter and help them out. Or who knows, maybe i can even write one to the president of the United States and tell him that we need help down here.

My point here is any student can express themselves and help others in many ways not just community service. All kids have hobbies even if they might not know it yet, kids may like to draw, write, play sports, collect money, or even just liking to help others. Just with those things anyone can make a difference. So i honestly think you shouldn't make all of the students do community service. An idea that you can do is take a vote on how many kids would like to do community service and let them do it. But you should also take a vote on how many kids want to help even by going online and looking at all the horrible stuff that we've been through or stuff we will go through in the future and i grantee you that more kids would want to help in any way possible

I think all students should be required to take community service. Reason being , I think students should have some type of experience in helping our community out. Not only the community but to help the planet out as well. It would help most students who are teens. Because it will most likely keep them out of trouble during there time helping out. It can help them stay on track in school, keep up their grades. And have extra credit. Also help keep them from being at the wrong place at the wrong time. I also think it will be a nice experience for those who want to help out. It could also be a fun learning program by having the students learn about their environment and their surroundings. Having students do community service will be a great way of helping save some animal. Animals? You may think. Well yeah animals too. In their own special way. It would help keep all kinds of animals from putting things in their mouths, and help them by decreasing the death rate and health problems that are in the air. I strongly suggest this program. It would also be a nice was of making our school look nice. Not just from the outside but from the inside as well. There for I think you should have all students do some kind of community service to help out.

And it can help put more knowledge. Students doing community service might also have an impact on the younger kids by wanting to help keep the environment clean and safe for all people. I strongly recommend this program. I hope this may help change your mind. Thanks for your time and support in having to read my letter.

This would keep us from playing the we want to play sports that I want to do like football , baseball and other sports that keep us healthy and self motivated. For us to not be able to do what we want outside of school would be insane .

Dear. Principal,

I think that we should not have any community service because like it takes up like way to much time. Like kids have a lot of homework these days and you want us to do our homework right? And also a lot of us kids have sports that we are in and we don't want to miss a game because we have to do community service like no. Also, kids want to hangout with their friends too because we love our friends. Doing community service takes up way too much of our time and we have better things to do in our lives. Other adults can do community service its not that hard so i don't see why us kids and teenagers have to the community service it should be the adults since they think they know everything. If you want us to start doing community service it is just going to take up our time so its not fair because we have lives too and we need to get our school work done and like study for tests. If you make us to community service i know that a lot of kids wont do it anyways so you cant have it your way sorry but you cant so either way your not going to get your way.",2,Community service,Independent,0.2

I think that community service is an important job and should be taken seriously, but others may not. I think you should make community service optional for many reasons, one being the fact that some people may not like it and just bring negativity to the whole process. I think community service should be a good thing and no one would want a negative person there, bringing everyone down with them. Also the people volunteering wouldn't want a negative, unwilling person brought there by obligation instead of pure will helping out if they really wont help anyone. Another reason I think that community service should be optional is, that the people being forced to do it may just skip out and leave. This would bring false hope to the people or causes being helped and that would be rude. To prevent this I say we should make community service optional, to save others feelings and to prevent negativity.",3,Community service,Independent,0.4

I think students should be required to perform community service because it will help our community grow and prosper . We may not know it, but when we do thing's that harm our environment, it harms people and animals physically and emotionally, and we need those thing's to survive.

For example, we get things from our environments such as animals to eat, water to drink, air from plants to breath, and wood to build things. So if the people who work in the factories cant breath, how are they going to package the meat, vegetables, fruit, and grains that we need to survive? If the animals cant drink water due to it being polluted, how are we going to get those animals to eat?

What about education? Humans aren't born with the ability to talk, write, or read. We need to learn these things step by step. Education is one of the things that u will need especially to live out in the free world when you become an adult. People nowadays want all of these fancy new cars, and the big house, and the cute girl. Well question is how are you going to get the cute girl, or the big fancy house, and the nice cars without any education? Girls don't want a person who isn't smart. Big houses and fancy cars cost money. Without education who's going to hire you? McDonald's? That's where you are going to end up if your education isn't right. Without community service the economy's going to go downhill for the worse.

It would be best to require students to perform community service. They shouldn't think community service is just a waste of time because its not. There is litter everywhere in this town and we need people to pick the litter up.

For example, litter can become a health problem or can affect the environment. if there is too much litter it could be disaster. the environment can be affected the most from litter it can kill plants which mean no oxygen and can kill animals which means no food. people health can also be in jeopardy. if there is too much litter the air can become polluted and people would become ill.

Another example is, nobody would want to live in a polluted place with litter everywhere.

its disgusting and dirty. people can die from litter and there health can be destroyed. Community service is not a waste of time because your helping the environment and hundreds of people life.

My conclusion is, community service is not a waste of time. Your helping the environment and people's health. Help pick up litter and stop littering before it to late.",3,Community service,Independent,0.4

Did you know that 50% of community service around the world actually benefits the environment. That means cleaner learning environments, we would be helping out the community, and most importantly a better education. I know that if we got everyone in the school to help around with community service we would not only have great learning environments but be great academically.

I always here the principal saying, "" Excuse me can you pick that up!"" I know it gets really tiring and you waste a lot of energy. However if you get community service the environments will be squeaky clean, and you'll save a lot of energy. i also know how the country is in a recession now and we need money for school so with community service we'll saving lots of money.

Education, the one thing that America is really lacking today. Sadly to say from my opinion our education system is meant for the kids to fail. (Lucky for the teachers TEACHER_NAME. ) half the teachers aren't even qualified to teach. To greaten kids opportunity to moving on to the next grade community service will help. Test scores, grades, and their opportunity of being successful would rise through the ruff.

I think students should be required to perform community service because it does them good. Also if they don't want to do community service you will have a little talk with them. Also it is nice to do community service for your town or community. Also even though I have done community service in my town I would really like to show the students what helping the community is like. If they don't like doing community service they don't have to do ever again. Unless they get in trouble. Then they would have to do community service. For example for community service is cleaning up the streets when they have garbage on them. Also put pretty flowers in your village park. Also you can clean some buildings and also paint them whatever color you want. Also the students should pick up litter if they find it anywhere. Also doing community service would go on your college application.

I believe it is helpful for students to perform community service because it helps other students feel good about themselves knowing that they helped other people. When students feel good then it makes the school they go to look good. If they don't feel good about themselves they might dress poorly and make the school look bad. If the students look good the school gets a better reputation and can get more students. The more students, the more a family wants to move into the community. Here are some reasons why I think students should be made to perform community service. It makes them feel better about them selves, it makes the school look better, and it makes other families want to be apart of the community.

One, it makes students feel better about themselves knowing they helped an object or person. If they help someone it makes both people feel better about themselves, if they helped an animal they feel happy knowing they did something for it. It's about how good the students feel in order for them to not be involved with gangs, drugs and violence. If they are involved with those things then it will help them see what they need to fix and maybe get them on the right path.

Two, It makes the school look better. Plus if the students are happy it gives the school a lighter atmosphere. When students and facility are happy, it makes the school that much of a happier place. When they are mad, it makes the school look like it's not doing its job. And that would scare potential students away. If the students are sad then it makes the school look like something happed that wasn't supposed to.

Three, more families in the community is more students for you and for your school. It can help spread the word because they will tell their friends about how great of a school this is. And when they tell their friends, their friends would probably want to come and bring their children. It is also expanding the community and letting us build more houses and, possibly, bringing a playground for the younger kids. Which would also lead back to community service, because if the older kids are babysitting then they won't get into as much trouble and they'll realize the value of a dollar.

In conclusion, I believe we should have students do community service because if they do than they will feel better about themselves, make the school look better, and it will make more people want to come into the community. Sir, with all the reasonings I have given you is all the reasons I believe we should make students do community service. It will help with the school and bring in more students. Why else wouldn't we want to do community service? Because some people don't want to get up? Because some people are lazy? It will help with lowering gang war fare, drug dealings in schools and with the younger population. So as you sit there, mulling over weather or not we should have community service, look back at the Pros and Cons of having community service, I hope I was able to help you with your decision.

A concerned student.",5,Community service,Independent,0.8

I believe that students should not be required to perform community service. I feel that each student and their families have the right to not perform community service. But I do feel that one who performs community service should get some sort of reward. Maybe extra credit points or a party would be sufficient.

I think that students should have a choice of whether or not to perform community service, because I have experience with community service, and I find it rather boring and tiring. If they decide not to do it, they might not be well thought of, and that is their own problem. Another reason for why I think that the students and their families should have a choice on performing community service is because they might not be able to. Maybe a student's family does not own a car, and the work site is too far away to walk in a reasonable time. Or, someone in the family has died, and one parent has to work seventy-five hours a week, for a relatively low pay check. They also might be constantly busy, and just do not have the time for it.

I would probably be more inclined in performing community service with incentives. This would probably give the students more motivation, thus, more community work would get completed. If they offered extra credit, a party, or maybe a homework pass, more students would work for their community. In the long term, they might get used to it, and feel that life is missing something, and would perform community service more often.

The community service that the students perform, would also help students to grow closer to each other, and become mentally and sometimes physically stronger. It would also help the community. The students would be much more inclined to do it if some of the work that would need to be done directly benefited them, like a new park or skate park. This would not only help the community, but it would help the students too, whether the liked it or not, or even realized it, or not. The community would definitely realize it, and would feel much better about passing the world down to the next generation.

I think Community Service is very important in the world today. Community service is a way to help out the community in any way it needs, Some communities like mine for example are really bad. It has trash everywhere and abandon houses on every corner. I try to help my community in the best way i can by not littering an cleaning up the messes that's there.

Community service is also a good way to get into college. College is a very important thing to accomplish in life. College determines the life you would set for yourself in the future. To get into college you have to perform many hours of Community Service. This helps show that you are a good person in the world and want to make the world a better place.

If students in our school perform Community Service i' m sure that they will see what change they have made in our society. If students perform service to others outside of school they might be willing to help others inside school. Students can perform services like visiting and helping elders at a nursing home, planting community gardens in their neighborhood, or even helping out a shelters or hospitals. They would see the change they made an know they became a better person.

Our school could even hold a fundraiser or event to see which top three (3) students can perform the most community service hours in a certain amount of time and they could even win a prize. Lots of kids would participate an our school would have made or community a better place.

I think that making someone choose to do community service is the right thing to do. To make people do community service is unfair to the people who have after-school activities, tutoring, and other things they have committed to.

Community service should be something that somebody wants to do, not something that they have to do. Some people don't have time to do community service and some people have obligated their time to other things such as piano, dance, football, basketball, and etc. It would be nice for people to give back ,but people can do it on their own time, not on a schedule.

If you did make people do community service, kids will not have extra time to do homework or study. You might see some of the smarter kids grades drop and that means that if you had kids that aren't already doing well in school would be worse in school than usual. I also think that it would put more work on the faculty. Which also means that you would have to start paying more to the teachers and less on what really matters to help educate the kids at this school. You have to pay money towards books, utensils for teaching, and other things needed to get the kids educated.

If my reasons did not convince you then, I think you must have a good reason why you want to do all the community service. I have had many good reasons why you should not make everyone do community service like, money, after school activities and other reasons i hope I have changed your mind. I look forward to what you will choose I think that community service should be something that people want to do and not what you are making them do. This might make people think that community service is a punishment and it isn't, so I feel like they might think that this is a bad thing to do and never want to do it again. I hope that you have taking this letter seriously and have listed your options. Always give things second thoughts because one thing you might think is a good idea, but then later find out that it isn't.

I think every student should be prerequisite to do at least two hours of community services. Community services is a commendable thing to do because we all are helping out the community by helping little kids such as tutoring or cleaning up your neighborhood for a cleaner earth.

Some people might just think community service takes too much time away from what they have to do and is a waste of time. But by doing community services each of us is doing something subsidiary. I think if we all do this we can make our community a better place to live in and i assure your that after doing so many good and helpful things toward others, in the end you will feel and be a better person.

Community services is also good because it is sometimes prerequisite for some high schools and colleges, which will make you look like a better person, being part of the community. Community Services isn't all that bad because at the end of the day, you just got to think back and realize how much you did and how that will make a difference to someone you helped or change something you did.

Some types of community services; is volunteering at the hospital helping clean up litter by the road sides or side walk. Even helping out at your church or just going to the nursing home to help. All this and much more will help you serve in the community and be a better person.

I think if it is imperative for all students to perform community services, that it'll make the school look like a better place and so will the students. This is a way of good form and will be various different type of community services for every different student to choose from every student should at least pick two different types of services to do.",3,Community service,Independent,0.4
