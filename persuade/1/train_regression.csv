In the text it states that

At least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions. The software is the latest innovation from prof. THOMAS HUANG, of the beckman institute for advanced science at the university of Illinois, working in collaboration with prof. NICU SEBE of the university of amsterdam. Dr. HUANG and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The MONA LISA demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it showa just how much this computer can do. Imagne a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.     ",1,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.0
13135DA2A1AD,"Facial Action Coding System is a system in a computer that takes human faces and tells the emotions of that person, made from Professor Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all forty four major muscels in the nodel must move like human muscels. They tested this system on the Mona Lisa painting who was created by artist Leonardo da Vinci. The system shows that the Mona Lisa is eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and two percent angry. However, they are trying to use this technology to read students' emotional expressions, which I am strongly against for the fowling reasons.

Students should have the right to tell rather how they feel or not. As a student in high school, facial expressions are key to what kids are thinking. If students do not want to say what that student feels they should be able to keep it to themselves. All students should have the right to defend themselves with their thoughts. The movement towards that technology to get students emotional expressions will start making a fight between students.

To add to, this system is a very expensive system where schools do not have the money for. Schools need to focus more on getting more help for their students, not finding out their emotional expressions. However, having this system can help students who are in need of guidance, but the students would rather talk to a counslor than a computer. Schools should put more of that money into new books or new activites for the students so the students can say well educated and socially active.

To sum it up, the Facial Action Coding Sytem is a system in which a computer reads a humans face. They should not use this on studenets for privacy of the student, and financial issues. This is a brlliant idea towards pictures of people as in the Mona Lisa, not in students. Students have the right to go to a guidance counsler for issues if they have any, but a student should not get he or she face read unless of student conncent.

And how they used it to find out how the Mona Lisa was feling when she was painted i think that is truly amazing. i think that we should use this technology at school to read the students emotions.

I think its a great idea to use for school, so teachers can tell how the student is feeling and can find a way to help them. In paragraph 6 the author uses the exmple of how we could use this new technology during school for example he wrote, ""If you smile when a web ad appears on you screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, th next ad might be different."" And instead of ads they could be explanations on how to do a problem. I think that that would inprove the students learning.

In conclusion i think that we should use this new techonoly to our aventage and use it in the classrooms so we can tell which students need help and which one doesn't. That way we can help them. They might even learn even more. ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
59F068C71B96,"Facial Action Coding System or also known as FACS is a new and revolutionary technology that can recognice emotions. This new technology was invented by Dr. Huang. Dr. Huang created this amazing tehnology so people would know how others are feeling so they can get help. He even goes and says that it could be use in cumpter classes. So would it be a good idea?

The answers is yes. Now the reasons i think its a good idea its because it can help the student to actually enjoy what they are learning . So the reason that i can help the student is because if they feel bored in classroom the computer would notice and it would take action, for instance it could change the lesson. And that is what Dr. huang predicts as in the paragragh he says ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor "". So that is why i beileve it would be a great idea for those computer classes.

In conclusion Facs is a great technology that should be use to help others and to know how they are feeling. Because as we just saw this is something that is usefull and that it could help. Human communication is nonverbal and that includes emotional communication that's why this piece of technolgy could be and will be usefull.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2

Are construction a computer with a 3-D computer model of the face; it uses all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles, this is called an ""action unit"".

I support this idea and here is why I do. This will show very high improvement in class rooms, as this it will show how a kid can learn, if they are happy about this subject and if they are highly entertained, or this could go another way of teaching say we didn't have this type technolgy. A math teacher gives there students a test, the average over all is a 72%, that is not good, a teacher will have to go over the subject again majority due to failing of the subject. Was it the teacher, or was it the students, who will ever know, but if they had the technogly in the room to read their facial expressions, for that the teacher may have post poned the test due to the results of the facial expressions coming back, which could have showed alot of confusion over the section. That could have saved alot of time and get better grades, as they could of not gone back over the section. This would show a lot of improvement in testing scores over all, as teacher would not mine going back over a answer if a student or students or confused what is going.

There are 6 different basic emotions in the system, happiness, suprise,anger,digust,fear and sadness. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

In fact, we humans preform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. We can tell when a friend is happy, or upset, due to how much we around them. Its that this 3-D facial computer system can even tell more when you can't.

If we had this in a class room , this would help so much, schools could see higher test scores and better improvements. I think it would even better if they took this to even more places. Such as Jails, Conceling areas, Thearpists, as it could show in their true emotions, this could be a lie dector, shows the emotions. Say they can't get anything from someone in a jail, they use that, they could see a fear emotion, or a blank emotion, or sad emotion. I just say this could change the future of alot things in every day life. This could also mean that, school corportaions might recieve rewards for really high scores in testing, which could really help out and some schools, for instance my school, we have don't have some of the newest technolgy as some other schools due, and why because i go to a small school, so we don't recieve high standards as other schools around us do. So that is why i agree we should have this newest technolgy and alot of the schools, to suceed in life and to help kids get better.            ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

Reason for the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) read the emotional expressions of a student can benefit by how the teacher can teach beacuse if a student make different emotions like confuse,bored or overwelm while a teacher teach can show that what the teacher is doing is not working.

Whe a sutend show a confuse emotion is showing that the work the teacher has given is to hard to comprehend. Showing to the tacher that she has giving to much of a hard work for a student to understand it. Giving that situation the teacher can make a plan to low donw to a level of the student grade she is teaching.

A bored student is not much good to have in a class because whe a student is bored it intent to start distrubtin a class or come to fall a sleep in class. Thas showing to the teacher that the way is teaching is has become to un-interesting,that should let the teacher know that her has has to come more interesting and\or active so students can show more curiosity to class and get inspired to learn the class.

When a student comes overwelm it coem a stress and start to panic for all the work the teaches have givin. Showing the student being overwelm shows teacher that it have giving to many work or the class have become to hard to comprihend. Tha so ones the teacher knows that student s have starting to become overwelm because of her class she has to star changin her plan of teaching so tudent can learn better and a eassy way.

In conclution the class room computer could reconice when the student is becoming confused or bore and /or overwelm. That could modify the lesson so it can be an efective to the human instructor. So they are able t o plan a better way to teach students a easy and better way so student can comprehended better",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

It is important to show love to others when they are feeling so type of way other then happy. It would help teachers understand why a student is acting the way he/she is.

It could be helpful to know how your student is feeling. A computer that knows when your happy or sad would be helpful to teachers. Having A classroom computer that could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored would help teachers know if her students are struggling with what is being taught or if they need help with anything. It would save a teachers time asking students if they are in need of help because sometimes a student might be shy to raise there hand or embarassed that he is not getting the hang of it but his other classmates are.

The use of a technology to read the emotion expressions of students in a classroom would be a life changing thing it would be helpful to know how your student is feeling.

With the new software, the Facial Action Coding System, we can advance in so many ways with the way our lives function. Our computers could be able to detect what we like and what we don't, that way we can view only what we do like and not have to view what we dislike. In Paragraph 6, D'Alto demontstraits what could become of our technology, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" The new software could change our everyday lives and help simplify them as well.

Along with helping us with technology at home, it'd be able to make our school lives easier. In Paragraph 6, Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor."" This new software could be compared to someone is able to tell how their friend is feeling. Dr, Huang believes that this could even be a new electronic code, meantioned in Paragraph 5, ""His new computer software stored similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of ""Da Vinci Code""!""

If all of our computures could read our emotions, we could comunicate with our computers without a problem. In Paragraph 4, it's explained by Dr. Huang how that could be even remodely possible, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighing the different units,the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in the da Vinci's masterpiece).""

The science of emotions have revealed so much about people's expressions. Drama classes use facial expressions to imitate certain emotions when acting to make it look as realistic as possible. In Paragraph 9, a coach uses the technique to instuct actors, ""A renowned dram coach,Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage.

This machine created by Dr. Huang and his colleague prof. Nicu Sebe can impact students in ways that are good or bad. For some people it can be a good thing but for others it can mean a bad thing.

The bad thing of this emotion recognition is that students with medical issues that affects their learning because of it affecting them from using technology. For u schools who use this technology have to focus on their students with medical problems that affects them from even using it. Also another thing that schools have to worry about is the finance for the computers that break and has to be repaired.

The good things about having this type of technology in schools is that it have more students be more interested in learning and can help them plan out what they would like to do in their future. Having the emotion recognition can help students in advanced classes who struggling with their classes have a more easier way for them to pass and graduate with the diploma they wanted. This can technology can have more students graduate and have less high school drop-outs.

The emotion recognition can be a good thing for certain students and can be a valuable thing, but for other students it can affect they way they learn if they are more hands on or have a medical problem that makes them unable to use technolgy.

A603DB484D6B,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System, to read emotional expressions of students, isn't valuable.

What if there is something someone is trying to hide? Something that is very personal and other people shouldn't know about, but you an see how they're feeling so you insist they tell you.

The technology might not actually work. I t might jut be a scam to make people think that they're feeling certain way about something. It shoudn't be possible to just use a machine to tell how someone is feeling inside.

The Facial Action Coding System was a very clever device. You could see how someones feeling in a picture, in person, you could even see how people feel towards homework.

""the software can even identifiy mixed emotions.... each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion).""

The system will be useful in many ways, but I think it can be very useful in the everyday classroom. Teachers have always wondered how their students were feeling at all times during their lesson, and this software can help them reach out to their students tremendously. It can help with their lesson plan, their attitude, and their teaching style, making it a good work environment for the students.

Teachers make a lesson plan for the week and it can change depending on the circumstances. Imagine being a teacher and being able to read the students' faces an emotions. In paragraph 6, it states that ""the software can recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused."" This can allow teachers to analyze the situation in which the classroom is in. If the students are generally happy, then you can go along teaching and educating them the same way as you did before. Now, what if the students were not so enthused about your lectures? If the students show a monotone facial expression, or maybe a bored and sad one, then it might be due time to go and fix your mistakes, make the plan more exciting, and get them excited about learning. This can improve their confidence and allow them to have a bright future.

The way students act in class often create a chain reaction, making the teachers either pleased or digruntled with the way the students behave. If the teachers can read their expressions, change their lesson plan, and create a greatly improved learning environment, then everyone can go home happy. The students will listen more intently and the teachers will not have such a hard time dealing with their attitudes. In this scenario, everyone can get along well together and enjoy their time in the classroom.

In paragraph 3, it states that the software can ""classify six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness."" Picking up these emotions on a student can change the way a learning environment works. If the student is showing signs of negative facial expressions and emotions, then the teacher can alter their style of teaching. They can create a warm and fun learning environment for the pupils, which can lead to them successfully gaining the knowledge they need to move on in life. The way a student acts in the classroom can affect many others around them and their attitude towards learning. If a teacher can detect even the slightest bit of negativity in the classroom, they can stop the spread and do their best to make learning fun and relatable for the students.

This new software could be innovative for the way classrooms work in the future. If students could be educated the way they would want to be educated, yet still get the knowledge they need to succeed, then the future generation could be unstoppable. In paragraph 9 it states that ""making faces can reveal so much about the science of emotions."" There are no limits to what the next generation can do if it all starts with teachers being able to read the emotions of their students. The future starts here with this idea, and this software.

taking about Eckman i classified some basic emotions too people now are bored, sleeping, stress, sad, and fear because they want to pass the test and do good this work everyone has something in hi's face.

The facial expressions shows some emotional like happy , anger ect.

every day we have differnt caract or diferent emotional feeling and i don't know how Monna Lisa can be really intended tom bring a smile for us face. i thonk i cant recognize how my best friend feeling is just lokking her eyes cause i know her i and I know when she is happy, sad, bored, confusedand fear, I think people show the feelings but some people can's see because they don't care about it. I think that techonology is a great idea for us or some people who want to know feeling about some people important in their life. I think every emotional has one special moment sometimes are not special but its life and we can't do something abou it. Sonetines we have mixed of emotions like the Monna Lissa. She look happy but at the same time serious. Her smile look like different she can't smile like us. The reson of that is now she is just a painting. Leonardo da Vinci's paint the Monna Lisa but he die that the reason she doens't have the aye browns and thats why she sook serious. That is the reason she look like with different emotional feeling cause she don't have eye browns and she look likr that. we can see the movements in the people face and we can take an idea of how they are or how feeling and emotional are the face show everything.

We have the option let the techonology do that for us or do that for people if we really care about his feeling or emotional.

I believe using technology to read emotional expressions of students is valuable because you can identify how they are feeling and learn their emotional expression. Is also valuable because you can tell if it work well or not. This is a way of testing this new technology and using it. Is to see everyone emotion such as happy,sad,angry,excited, shocked, etc. This is also a good idea to use this technology so they can identify if the students emotion is real or fake.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" The purpose of this technology is to identify each emotion expression. You can see the students emotions even if they are trying to hide it. The article also said that ""new software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others."" Is a better way for humans and computers to communicate, also can calculate.

Teacher can help the students by identifying their emotions because it will make them feel better. This technology will be so useful because you don't have to worry about looking at students let the technology handle it. Is valuable because it shows how they feel their expression and emotion."" The technology can identify six basic emotion happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. ""The technology can associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.""

The article said ""the process begins when the computer constructs a 3D computer mode of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model. What the technology does is first it identify the emotion expression then is match with the characteristic movements. Each facial expressions emotion are universal stated in the text. Is valuable because the technology can also identify mixed emotions, it can do alot of cool things. It is believe that humans perform the same impressive calculation everyday, which is true.

In conclusion i really believe that using this technology to identify students emotion expression is valuable. Not only does it help the teachers but i think it can really help the sudents too.

The most valuable thing from the technology is identifying multiple emotion or mixed emotions. This technology can also be really useful in the future becasue it has tons of things it can do. I agree with this claim that using this to identify emotions are valuable and helpful.   ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
B9D9B02EFC86,"There is so many of emotions, and only we know if we want to show them or not. Emotional expressions help us to show how we feel, or we can only pretend them, that is why I am against with the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. We have to think if they really want us to know what are they feeling? We all are humans, so we know that sometimes we feel embarresed of something, and we do not want to people know that. Adding to these we have to have our privacity.

Our emotions expressions help us to show how we feel. If we are sad we have a sad face, if angry we have a face that reference that we are angry as on the paragraph number 5 says "" for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". So there is no reason to have the Facial Action Coding enables computers to identify human emotions.

Emotions expression can also being prentend them. Every single person has problems, and sometimes we are shy to let them know to other people, so we need our privacity, and we have to pretend that everything is all right, when maybe is not like that. If someone is sad, but he/she wants to look she is happy, so there is nothing to do, because is her/his decision. We have to think in the point of view. We can see on paragraph number 6 says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becaming confused or bored"" what about if the student feels emberresed, if everybody that he is the one who does not understans a topic?

But also the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions can help, but if the person wants to. Because people sometimes does not know how to tell people how they feel. Also it could help in differents ways to different careers. For example the police career, when they interrogate people, they can notice if they are telling the truth or they are just lying.

In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System anables computers to identify human emtions have to be used only in a special case. We have our own emotions, and our unique forms to show how we feel. If we want to be reserved is our desicion, and if we want to show our emotional expressions it is okay as well. Only we decide how to feel, and if we should show our emotions up. We have a right that is call personal privacity, we have to remember that.                                            ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

Would you feel like your privacy was invaded? Would you feel judged? I know I personally would feel threatened and exposed. I beleive that the

Facial Action Coding System, a computer program that can identify human emotions, would have no value in a classrom because, it has no practical use in a learning enviorment such as a classroom, it would be an invasion of students privacy, and while it may not be of use in a calssroom, it could be put to use in other fields of work.

I think that this emotion identifing technology would have no practical use in a learning classroom enviorment becasuse teachers have to ensure the material is digested by students no matter what emotinal state they are in. While recogonizing a students emotions could expalin why they may be uninterested in the material it does not change the fact that they still must learn it if they want to further their own education. Therfore, I beleive that this technology would be of no use to both the student and the teacher.

I also beleive that this technology would have no practical use or value in a classroom due to its nature, its a blatant invasion of privacy. Its unfair to the student to be subjected to this indentification of emotion everyday. Some students may feel like their privacy is being invaded just so a teacher could know how they were feeling at that exact moment. Furthermore, students may not want their emotional state to be regonized due to personal reasons such as not wanting others to know they are feeling sad or depressed becasue they don't want others to know becsause they would attempt to reach out and that alone could result in unwanted conflict. This leads me to beleive that this technology holds no value in a classroom.

Finally, I beleive that while this technology may have no practical use or value in a calssroom, it could be put to great use in other fields of work and other aspects of life. For example, in the article researchers use this technology to decipher the emotions of the famous Mona Lisa. This helps them get an understamding of how much the artist knew about facial muscles and expressions, which is useful in learning about how artist learned thier techniques in the past. This technology would be amazing in the enteratinment industry. Futhermore, it could be used for more acurate CGI, which would be useful for movies, tv shows, and video games. Next, I beleive that this technology would be useful for scientific studies. It could help reseraches understand how emotions work and formulate which could help people who have issues with muscles in their face, technology could be developed that could help them express themselves better. Anothe reason why I believe this technology could be put to more practical use in a diffrerent enviorment then a classrom is the applications and uses it could have in solving crimes. Police could use this tech to help decpiher how a criminal is feeling which could bring more evidence to a case.

While this amazing technolgy has many applications outside the classroom, I believe that it has no practical use inside a classroom becaue it has no effect on learning the subject matter in a more efficent manner, and it be an invasion of privacy to the students and possibly the teachers as well. We area already studied and invaded enough by higher ups and people beyond and in the goverment, do we really need our students emotions in a classroom to be put under a microscope as well?",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8

But it can help to tho cause how about if somebody sick but they dont know thats how we can know if that persin sick, just thinking. How do it work what they do ti find out the emotions of the person, do they put plugs on they face.

How do Dr. Huang know that he can do this ,like how he know this wont hurt nobody doing this. so by weighting the different units the software can even identify mixed emotions.

724CFBF0B317,"Yes I am with the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions.

I am with it because it would get to know the students better and make them into a better person. It could also help you be on task more and not be distracted by the little things you see.

I see it could help from these evidence in the artical because right here it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". In that sentance it is saying that a classroom computer is knowing when a student is confused or bored I think if a computer knew exactly when that was I think it would be pretty cool. Going into the computer and the computer knowing what you are and who you are and how you deal with your life is pretty rare to do.

Another way I strongly agree on is for instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on there face right?

of course but image a computer doing the same thing. Dr. haung ovserves that artist such as da vinci studied a human anantomy to hlep them paint facial muscles precisely enought to convey the most important emotions. Others think on how you feel the first day is how you will feel the 2nd day and then its just gonna keep going until you need or get help. What if somebody was getting mentily abused from somebody cruel and rude and they did not say anything to anyone. Well thats why we got the computer to help us out and it would tell us how it really felt on who they are.

Helping others out could really benefit somebodys life in alot of ways. Techology would really need more and more advice from other companys. in paragraph 3 it says "" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face and all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". Im that sentace it is talking about more of the muscles than computers.

Then test on the humans to see if they are showing ""emotional expressions"". You may be able to test there musscles and if they are hard and twich alot it shows that they are lieing or if they just relax and let it go through like you should it would show the truth.

A conclution of this is that my opinion i think we should have it around earth because I think we as people need to help others if they are having bad problems with there lives so thats why we need the computer to test them out and see how they are doing with it. Dr Paul Echman has classified six basic emotions of happiness , suprise , anger , disgust , fear or sadness and this computer could tell you what you are if you would do the test.

I feel like if you can calculate emotions on a persons face you could understand that person better and what there feeling.

You could do a 3-D model of the face and put in all of the muscles just like a human has on their face.

You could understand if their happy, suprised, or even sad. Your frontalis pars lateralis muscles ( above the eyes ) raises your eyebrows when your suprised or scared.

Your emotions could be all over the place.

You could have certian facial expressions.

For an example, you could have your fear look. You could've saw something that you're afraid of and have a fear look. The software could even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face.

I know that everyone has different facial features, but some people have the same facial expressions.

I personally think that we should all have different facial features because no one can be the same and no one is perfect.

This technology could observe how our face is formed in the future.

Yes the reason why I say yes it's because some studets can understand some thing . And if they can understand it the computer could be able to under stand the assingment well . Also this can help see where is it the student struggles . And it can be a game changer for alot of school .

Some good things about the software are that know's if you force a smile by detecting the muscle in the face. For example if a student gets stuck on a question or the teacher is busy with the another student or if you dont feel like bothering the teacher the software could help . This program can help or notify the teacher if a student is stuggling and with what they each struggle . Because in some schools teachers can't find out what is wrong with some student . This can really become somthing great for the future generations by modfing the lesson for each student . For example if a student doesnt like the subject the program can detect that and make it funner . The reason why is because some students think some teachers teach boring things and with this program it can make the lesson funner .

In conclusion this software could really help out schools . By making students like school because some complaints I hear from some of my friends is that a certan teacher is boring or they can't make the lesson fun . So if the lesson is boring the camara can check the face the individual is making and modify the lesson . This program may also raise a generation of smart students if this where ever to happen .

BEE4BD548167,"When comparing the Mona Lisa smile to othersyou can tell the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one, also Dr. Paul say's there's technology telling what a person if feeling by their face, lastly you can tell when a person is feeling some type of way by a video.

The difference between a genuine smile and a forced smile is that, a genuine smile is when you have to use less bones to smile about e6 bones to smile, and you look like your into the smile for a reason, and forced smile is when there's a smile barley on your face and its easy for you to get it off your face. Because, you were barley smiling, and that means your forcing yourself to smile.

Technology telling you how a person feel is kind unlikly to happen in this century right now. The only way too know how someone feel is by the way they act toward other people and theirself. they isolate theirself from everyone, and they don't be theirself.

F389D1B47E5B,"Have you ever wondered the emotional expressions of students? Me too, which is why the Facial Action Coding System can help solve this problem. It compares everything to a ""neutral"" face, so you can see if you're one hundred percent happy, one hundred percent sad, etc. Each emotion will be distributed in the results of the test. Dr. Paul Eckman being the creator.

It can be used as an emotion indicator on students in a classroom. Dr. Paul Eckman has classified the tool to only six basic emotions, which he says,""Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnessand then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" For example, he noticed that when people raised their eyebrows they became ""surprised."" Or if you tighten your lips, you show ""anger."" He sees signs of emotion with each expression the face makes.

Video imagery is even being used to spot emotions in pictures or paintings. The pictures being able to describe the faces of the children. Dr. Huang states that,""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" So even though many kids have different emotional faces, each student is making the same expression. The software can even see mixed emotions, just like in ""Mona Lisa.""

We make the same calculations every day. For example, if you were a teacher looking at your students, you could most likely tell how someone was feeling by the look on their face. Dr. Huang says,""Artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" So da Vinci used an altered version of this way back when, but was mostly mental capabilities. The value of reading the students emotions, could become very helpful in seeing if a student is having trouble in class or with friends.

Muscle differences can even indicate a false emotion! The author says,""the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth, and in a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" So if you catch one of your students smiling sideways at you, then you know they're treating you to a fake smile. Faces don't lie... if you notice a student false smiling then you may find that they are lying. Try not to use false smiles because you might get caught.

This technology is useful to sensing the emotions of the students in a classroom. If someone is having trouble with classwork, then this could help to determine the problem and find a fix. The video imagery is useful in finding emotion in old pictures from the past. Also, being able to check if someone is using a fake smile is quite handy in terms of the truth.

First, being able to tell how a person is feeling with technology is a very intresting job/thing to do. The software is the latest innovation form Prof wicth makes it very intersting to work on just becaue its the latest and not many people get to use it. Being able to tell a persons emotions by technology also benefits the person by meating all the experst and better ways in developing for humans and computers to communicate.

Next, the Facial Action Coding System is not only a fun thing to do but it can also benifit a lot by learning any diffrent ways to use technology. Many people may also learn about all types of computers that are able to tell the face experesions of a person. Not only that the person can learn all the diffrent types of like human face muscles. A person could also learn the 6 basic emotions.

Finally, Being able to tell a persons emotions may get very fun to do.

By using the Facial Action Coding System, the computer can identify that a student is bored. It can then go on to modify the lesson to better engage the student. The methods that best help students learn are unique to each individual, so using this technology can make for more engaged and enthusiastic learners.

Some lessons can move too quickly or can simply be difficult to understand. The Facial Action Coding System can detect confusion in students and make changes to the lesson to help the student better understand. The technology can slow the lesson to a pace best suited for the individual. It can also modify the lesson so it is put into terms that the student easily understands. This allows students to move at their own pace and have a better understanding of what they are being taught.

The Facial Action Coding System can also detect when a student is enjoying their lesson. This information can be used to enhance teaching altogether by providing a baseline method for planning each lesson. It can be used to determine what methods are most commonly understood and allow for the modification of lessons for people that don't have access to the technology. By getting a baseline, the information can then be utilized in classrooms even without the technology.

Although there is no definite way to ensure that students will completely understand the things they are taught, the Facial Action Coding System can definitely enhance learning for a better understanding. By being able to detect satisfaction, confusion, and boredom in students the technology can allow more students to learn and enjoy what they're learning.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

But to say if this facial action coding can be relibel and give you accurte resluts is hard to believe. because just cause a machine tells you one thing doesnt mean its ture one can be happy and it can show the person mad. I just think for a fun a silly thing to try or do yes its valuable. But for something to speak on as if it acutlly works and did work and is giving accurte resluts no its not valuable. Like he said "" she was 80 percent happy 9 percent disgusted 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. Yes you can have a lot of mixed emtions but to have one after another by a machine telling you come on now. it then again could be ture but I couldnt see that unless she presented that to us her self how she was really feeling at that moment and time.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
114608C6747D,"Whoever thought that a machine could read a person's emotions? To our surpise, a highly advanced technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is capable of reading one's emotion by calculating the movement of our face muscles. Some may say that this technology has no value and should be abandoned. However, it is clear that this technology has a great amount of value because it helps us better understand the muscles in our face, it improves communication between people, and can improve the quality of faces in computers.

First of all, the experts of the software are constantly experimenting on different parts of the muscles in our face. By doing so, the experts are better understanding the part's of the muscles. On paragraph 3, the author cleary states that, ""all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. This shows that the experts have noticed these odd movements of the muscles. The muscles function similarly to legs. Also, on paragraph 4, the author talks about how this new technology can even detect ones mixed emotions. The evidence that he uses is the painting of Mona Lisa. The painting was filled with different types of emotions such as 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry.

Next, the technology has played a major role in improving our communication between people. On paragraph 6, the author shows us that most communications between people is through nonverbal. The technology can help ones understanding of emotional communications, thus improving their nonverbal communication. The technology can tell when someone is zoned out or just completely bored. On paragraph 6, the author states that ""A classroom computer recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This machine could better the communication between teachers and students.

Not only does this machine improve communications, this machine can improve facial expressions in our games and our technology. At the middle of paragraph 6, the author states that ""The same technology can make computer-anmated faces more expressive"". This will improve the quality of our video-games. Video games will become more vivd and realistic. Also, in the medical field, this improves the video surgery. With a better video surgey, more lives will be saved.

Lastly, the facial technology will and has played a major role in our lives. This machinery is a huge technological discovery and should be continued. This is because the technology has helped us better understand our facial muscles, has improved nonverbal communications between people, and has improved the quality of our computer-animated faces. This technology can play roles in almost every thing we do. From video games to hospitals, this machine does it all.                       ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
A32414F5B216,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions, that's a really smart idea right?. The software can see your emotions, six emotions, and facial muscles.

First, the person who made this software was Prof. Thomas Huang, the Beckman institute fro Advanced Science at the University of Illinois who started to find better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The first subject he wanted to do was Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. Your maybe thinking how do u use a software just to find out how someone is feeling well...

In fact, the computer takes the model of the picture or what ever is there,but it must have human muscles in the picture ir 3-D model the human muscles is called ""acton unit"". It only takes in the model if it see's it have forty-four major muscles like a human would have. Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman has classified for the software to have six emotions-happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear, and sadness.

Dr. Thomas Huang and his worjkers or friends that helped him with the software made six basic emotins that the human muscles have and made it to where it only workd if it have the 3-D effect with fourty-four human facial muscles witch is every smart.

Second, the actical siad home computers cant handle the complex algorithms, and school computers are old and not as good as most computers at home so they would need a dedicated computer just for this program.

Finaly, the artical siad it counted action point based off mussel movement up to 44 for one person, but for a class of 30 people it would have to find individual people and measure their mussel movement independently from everyone else.

E84FE06A6A50,"Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe have worked on a software that can detect how a person is feeling. The software is called teh FAcial Action Coding System, or FACS. The software can use muscle detectors to analyze and detect how a person is feeling. From my perspective, I think this is a great software to have, especially for certain situations. Some situations may include popping up media.

One reason why I think this is a great idea is because of it's function where it recognizes what you're feeling, and make modifications based around it, so you'll feel better. In the text, it mentions of how the software can detect whether someone is confused or bored, and can make some modifications to better suit the person. This shows that when it does that, it can help students better understand the topic. In the text, it mentions how when the software detects your emotion, it sends over an ad based on how you feel. This shows that if someone is feeling sad, they can send them an article about how to get better or how to overcome a loss, which is really useful. This is great for using media to assist you, but of course, it has a human-caused benefit.

The software can help you make random faces, and when done, it can help you with your emotions. In the text, it states that making fake smiley faces actually causes you to feel slightly happy. This shows that when you're making a fake smiley face when down, there's a chemical in your body that actually can help you get better. In the text, it states that Stanislavsky has his students make happy faces and frowning faces, due to the previous fact to help them better act. This shows that the software can help you detect whether or not you're actually acting a feeling well or not. Now, there is a benefit for those who don't have a software.

The software can detect facial muscles, and that helps it point out what a person is feeling. In the text, it states that the software succesfully recognized Mona Lisa's facial muscles, and it showed her to be 83% happy. This shows that the software can go through many paintings and easily detect how they're feeling. In the text, it states that with it's muscle-detecting technology, it can detect whether or now a politician or celebrity is being truthful or not. This shows that the software can detect whether or not a celebrity is lying, and that can helpful, especially in an allegation.

Overall, I believe that this technology is good to have around. It can detect how you feel, and attempt to assist you. It can cause you to make fake happy faces and actually feel happy. Finally, it can help out with detecting a truthful person or not. With that said, I believe that this will go great with classrooms in the country. ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
6C3654E9F5BE,"Making a claim against reading students emotions. In my opinion could be a bad idea. That might be taking technology a little too far. They caculated what the painter painted Mona Lisa feelings would've have been. Thats insane and just a little too far. If they can read a paintings expressions from several years ago. I wouldn't want them reading a humans facial expression. Thats my thoughts on that.

It says they can caculate humans expression like math hoemwork in paragraph 2. It begins with a computer that constructs 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 muscles of the human face must move like human muscles. Each humans facial expression is universal according to the statement in paragraph 4. It's pretty amazing to think about then again it's kind've scary humans can do that reading. I perform the same expressions every day well every one does it isn't just me. It isn't very valuable in my opinion either because maybe if their emotional problems are different then they need to be what are they going to do about it. It will just read his facial expressions won't change anything. That would also cost a lot of money to have in each certain classrooms and also a bunch of money to make the 3-D computer.

In paragraph 6 it says if your frowning and a ad pops up it can read that and if you smile a certain ad would pop up. Just crazy to think about. It says in paragrpah 7 your home Pc couldn't handle reading that of course and they are expensive enough. So that would be much more costly even.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
C1C606DD32BF,"Having the facial action coding system computer in a class is a good idea and valuable. One reason it is because you can tell how someone is feeling and how you cna help. another reason is because you can tell if the students learning or not. Last reason is it can brighten up the day to make someelse happy who is feeling sad or not. I think it is useful and who do good in a class room.

Just by telling if someone is down or not can really help alot with this computer. If you a teacher you can help your students be great. Having a bad morning can ruin your whole day. not even sleep can and being hungry can also if the teacher can see these things in there students it can make there jobs much easier. To help them not be sad or mad so they can clear there mind and learn .

This can aslo help for the kids to. They can get help if something is really wrong with them. if there sad or mad or if something going on at home if there not safe and etc. They can also tell there classmates mood. this can prevent things from happening such as fights and agurements ,conflict with anyone. becase everyone know how each other is feeling that day.

This computer can relly help without. it can help with kids who wanna grow up and create them computers who does that type of technology. maybe if one school get it and try it new schools would to and it can be in every school. maybe just not schools wanna try it , it can be for doctors to. it can be for everyone just to try out and figure each other out and be helpful.

in conclusion this computer the facial action coding system would be very helpful in a claaroom. For kids and adults, it can prevent things from happeing i. this computer can help other kids how needs help. and can see if kids are learning anything. and you can just see how everyone is feeling. so yess i think thr facial coding system is valuable for classrooms.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
590057B2F1E7,"How would I feel about being able to detect somone else's feelings? I honestly believe that it would be helpful to understand someone and what they are going through at that specific time.

My first thought on this opinion is that it must of took a while to actually build this and to think of the idea as to what you could use to figure it all out. When Dr. Paul Eckman built this he must of had to be thinking about other people and the concept of wanting to help others. In pargraph four it proclaims ""By weighing hte differnt units, the software can identitfy mixed emotions"". Dr. Eckman was on the right track building this because any human being can feel up to 3 emotions at once and he knew just that so he figured he would build it be able to detect not just one but mulitple.

In pargraph 5 it says ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial triat that conveys it"". By the arthour of this article I feel like he knows the cainf anf genorosity of being there and helping a friend. This being made is awesome because I don't know about you but most of the times i'm down or angery I don't like to tell people why or event talk about it being I will get even more upset no matter the size of the issue. The FACS is just the answer for helping a friend in need when you know they need the comfort but don't want to say anything.

There is so many good things about this new software that only genius could of thought of. A drama coach once made his kids practice making happy and sad faces due to actually feeling the emotions before they went on to a play. Placed before me in paragraph 9 ""Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" Did you know that actually listeing to you friends or parents when they say ""put on a happy face"" it may help. Study shows that this actually can make you happy and being happy is more of what we need in this world.

I highly agree with this article and give it a 10/10 considering it is a very kind think to do and not to mention a brillant idea. All the emotions it can detect right down to the percent in unbelieveable. It can take us far ways and may even make the world a better place.

7B1E55213D00,"Technology is becoming a bigger part of our lives. As time goes on, we develop new technology for different purposes. One such purpose is to read emotions. This technology will benefit our society in different ways, like in education. The technology to read students emotions is valuable to our schools.

The first way in which this technology is vaulable to schools is by improving lessons. Often times, many students of different calibers are thrust into the same classroom. While some grow bored others become confused by the content of the lesson. In the article, Dr. Huang is quoted saying, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" and then ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. If we implemented this emotion recognition technology, we could help students of all levels grow and reach their potential.

Another reason why technology that can recognize emotions is vaulable in schools is because of fighting and bullying. In paragraphs three and four of the article, it discusses how the technology works and what it can do. It claims that it can dectect mixed emotions and even, in paragraph 8, detect fake smiling. This technology could be used to detect when students are angry and wanting to fight or even sad from being bullied. Teachers cannot always detect these things from students, especially if they are trying to hide them.

In addition to stopping fights and helping bullied students, this emotion recognition technology could assist in identifying students who have problematic home lives and need help. Although this would not always be 100% accurate, it could help faculty see those students who might be depressed or angry, and need help. This would aid in making schools a happier place. It could also negate problems that they could have later in life. Installing this technology in our schools would be highly beneficial.

Schools need the technology to read students emotions. It would fit in with other technological advancements that have improved our education system. Advances in technology helped to improve not just our education, but our overall lives. Numerous people in our world cannot live without technology. Technology is important to our society.

Having the computer adapt to facial expressions would get the kids excited to learn, give the teachers a break, and increase learning rates tramendously. Having FACS in schools would increase how quickly kids learn and how the obtain it.

First off having FACS in schools would get the kids excited to learn. The computer would adapt to their likes and dislikes so they would always be pleasing them. How would it know if they are really bored or confused is a common question, in paragraph 3 the text states ""the computer contructs a 3D model of the face; all 44 major muscles im the model must move like human muscles"" this all meaning that the computer can tell with 100% accuracy what you are feeling.

Secondly it is difficult for teachers to please each kid individualy and work with each child 1 on 1 and with this technological advancment it will give teachers a break and require them to give minimal assistance to the kids. In this day and age technology is becoming a bigger and bigger part of our everyday soceity and less and less people are wanting to become teachers, so having a computer do the job for them and do it just as good is remarkable. The author wrote in paragraph 6 ""imagine a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" this quote from the article showing that they would do the teachers job and be able to adapt and please each student individualy.

Lastly having this technology in every school would increase learning rates greatly because it would work in a way to help and assure learning for each child individualy. The problem with teaching today is some kids dont learn as fast as other and the teacher doesnt slow down to make sure they know what they are doing, but with the FACS program it will allow kids to go at their own success rate and insure they are really learning. And with all this the kids will learn quicker as a hole because they are the computers only concern.

Then again students in the class room might not be okay with it. For example,if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen,a similar ad might follow,and it can tell if your becoming confused or bored. Some of they reasons of why Eckon created the new technology might be a little to much of the kids that rather look at the walls and be bored.

In order to get students to want theis new technology, we need to make the school and the creator find more ways to get them to understand why we need it. Make them understand why we feel that we need it. Also give them reasons on why we feel it should be valuable. And what can happen if we did have this type of technolgy.

Since we live in a digital world i feel that people and the students do not really understand why it could be okay to hvae new technology to read your emotional expressions. I think we need this techology for more then one reason. We need this technology because lots of kid go home complaing about why they are stressing so bad. They also got home complaing about being bullied abd not ahve enough time to do their home. And i know teacher now these days try to find better ways to make kids not go home complaing about anything,because there are better ways to get through the problem.

I honestly think that if we did have this new technology to read kids emotioal expressions when would not have as much problems like we do now. It's not bad to try something new for once. Just think about how do you think teachers our school feel when were not paying attention to anything they be talking about. Or how they ask us a question and we have no idea what in the world is going on. Having tchnology would be great for our school,and for our teachers,because they need to know how we feel about they lesson were working on. Teachers also need to know how much kids know.

Basically I am saying that i student show be able to expresss their feelings if they want to without everyone knowing.

Then this kinda has an up side to if this kind aof technology was in schools. Teachers could help student more if they are angry, or sad. Therefor I kinda see why the question is ""should this kind of technology be in classrooms?"".

What if that student just wants to be left alone? When I'm mad I don't want everyone knowing what's going on, I'd rather not talk to anyone unless I ask them for help about the situation. If they did put the technology in a classroom to tell what every child is feeling everyone would know each others business.

In the article it stated that it could help teachers know if the child is bored or confused, but does that child want the student to call him or her out on it? Probably not because if that student is struggling in class they don't want everyone knowing, if that student is struggling or confused then they need to ask the teacher at a seperate time if they don't want everyone to know how they struggle academically.

Not everyone is a emotional person they don't know how to share their feelings but they probably don't want some machine telling them how they feel and how they are feeling by how they look. Because anyone can fake a smile or a happy moment, but if that student doesn't know how to express themselves without a machine telling them, then they most likley don't want everyone else knowing what they're going through.

Technology has advanced majorly in just the past few years, but we are humans and we need to be able to show our emotions without a computer telling us how were feeling by how we look on that day. We all have bad days and we all have good days but on the bad day if that computer tells me I'm depressed then I could believe that and my mental state not be stable anymore because that computer told me I was depressed based on how I looked and felt one day.

Some classes teach you about tecnology so i think it would be helpful and a good example to show around.

E978E759F26B,"I'm going to type an essay about an arugement for this technology to read students emotional expressions. The newest software update is called Facial Action Coding System. I really feel like this type of technogoly would be really helpful.

There is a lot of prons and cons to this technogoly because some students may not want you to know how they are feeling or what there emtions are, I feel as if some students need the help or may feel, let's say lonely but don't like saying they are so they fake a smile but those are the students who really need someone to know. So I'm going ot start out in my first paragraph saying why I think it would be good to have this type of system.

My first paragraph is going to be my first reason why I feel that it would help and a little bit about the software. The software update has promising applications for a variety of industries. The computer constrcuts a 3-D computer model of the face all 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscles. I feel that it will help a lot more with young teenagers in our generation.

A lot of people in our generation are going through depression and they don't like to telling people about it, so if you have this software it would help kids from sucide thoughts or some things like that.

Another reason why it woud be helpful is because you could use it on anyone not just students. My first reason why I think it would be a brillant idea would be an example such as this, if you went to class one day and seen your friend upset you would be able to look at her and know shes upset but if you asked her and she said no I'm fine, she would be lying. If you had this software update and you used it on your friend it would say she is 70 percent upset and 30 percent mad. So now you know she is upset most of the time and you could change that by talking about things with her letting her parents know. Little things like that could change someones life forever.

My last reason I think it would be helpful is because you would know how everyones feeling. The Mona Lisa is to demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while showoing how much a computer can do. It also says in paragraph 6 that ""

A classroom computer could recogonize when a student is becoming bored or confused"". That could also help the teacher out a lot. Some students don't always let the teacher know if they are bored or confused because maybe they are scared or embarssed, but now your teacher would know if you were confused about something. She would be able to help you or do something a little more exciting.

My conclusion paragraph is going to wrap up my essay. As I said in the introduction I think this would be a really good idea for this software update to be in classrooms for teacher and students. I think it would help with teenagers. I gave a couple reasons why I would want this software update or why it would help. I have seen a lot of students falling asleep in class and the teacher just keeps going. I have also been one of those students were I'm really confused but I don't want to say in front of the class so I either don't say anything or I say something to my buddy next to me. Those are my reasons why I am for this Facial Action Coding System.                  ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
902212F4DDCF,"Facial expressions a classmate gives towards other classmates could end with a "" hey ! Want to be my partner ?"" or "" Meet me in the parking lot after school."" When glancing around the class to check the time on the clock a classmate has no idea what facial expression they are making. It's difficult to detect an unharmful face of a classmate if they seem angry and ready to rumble , even though the classmate is actually just confused about the assingment that was given.

Dr. Huang has created the new emotion-recognition software for that humans can now have a better understance of how a person feels about certian topics. "" The software can even identify mixed emotions."" There will not be any more wondering or confusion with assingments that are dificult to some students. "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" The computer will then modify the lesson for the student , so he/she can comprehen the lesson. This will allow the generator to be like an effective human instructor.

The emotion-recognition software might be on the verge to help lower the sudicial rate in America or around the world. ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen , a similar ad might follow. But if you frown , the next ad will be different."" If a person is prone to having destructive thoughts then the ad changing could imbue them to getting the help they need. This could also promote the person who smiles at the web cam to be more joyful and spread kindness to others.

Therefore , the emotion-recognition software will be an amuse help in schools and analyzing the emotions of a teen. Everyone could know what or how someone feels. This software can help inform an adult , teacher , or parent when a child is irritated by their surrounds , contemplating about harming their selves , or thoughts that could lead to serious mental issues or lethal consequences.

124F95E287B6,"Recent software innovations have came up with a really valuable idea. Its for humans and computers to better communicate. Its called FACS( Facial Action Coding System) and it is very valuable. There are many ways for it to be important inside the everyday classroom by being able to change the way an online class is taught. It's read through a students facial movements and able to read human expressions. So when a student gets stuck or can't keep up the computer can recoginze that.

In the passage it states "" a classroom computer could recoginze when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" Not only is it reading the student to see how he/she is feeling but also change the way something is being taught so the student better understands and wants to pay attention and learn. It goes back to it being a valuable or important in the classroom.

Dr. Huang's FACS is a very valuable and well designed program and it should be used in ever classroom. There are more than a few ways it is needed in a everyday classroom. Students would well benefit from this because a teacher has to teach every kid and it is hard for them to have one on one time with all the students struggling. This would help give students a specially designed program that best suits there needs and abilities. thats why FACS is valuable in every classroom not just in the classrom but maybe even in certain work places or offices where they are needed.

4BB49667767A,"Facial Action Coding is used to find the emotions of people based on how their muscles move in their face. As should by Mona Lisa she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 perfect fearful, and 2 perfect angry."" Therefore the FACS has show. Mona Lisa's emotions just by the coding. As you can see FACS would be great to help out around the world.

Facial Action Coding could help a lot in schools with helping people learn better. Dr. Huang states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" This shows that the classroom with FACS means a classroom where learning can become better. If a student is confused FACS can modify the lesson or help get the student unconfused. Also instead of students zoning out in class Facial Action Coding System will notice it. After FACS notices the student zoning out it can make sure the student zones back into the lesson. FACS can tell is someone is faking being happy. These are all reasons why VACS can help with everyday life.

In the end Facial Action Coding System could change how the school systems and the everyday life of humans are changed. With VACS no ones emotions would be saves, so it would be easy to tell if someone is scared, tired, sad, and happy. Mona Lisa was just a example what would you do it that was you?

55981C1C60B2,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System. He goes on the explain that this system enables computers to identify human emotions and that in can be valuable in the classrom. This system is not valuable in the classroom because, it is an invasion of privacy, computers aren't always right, and it will cost the school corporation a lot of money.

This system is not valuable in the classrom because it is an invasion of privacy. In the article it states that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". That sounds good, but what the article is saying is that a computer is always analyzing the students face, and it does not say where the data goes. Also the computer could not be very well protected and a hacker looking to steal data could hack into the computer camera and steal the students idenitiy. Finally, what if the student doesn't like the system? Is he forced to use it or does he get a choice, the article does not state on whether or not there is any consent to this.

This system is not valuable in the classroom because computers aren't always right. Computers are not human, you can not program a computer to have empathy or any human emotion. So you can not program a computer to read a humans face and accurately tell them their emotion. Also computer programs tend to have a lot of bugs in them, so this system could have a few hidden bugs that could make the system broken and unusable. Finally, the article states that, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms..."", so what kind of computers are students going to use that are capable to run the system?

This system is not valuable in the classroom because it will cost the school corporation a lot of money. Like in the last paragraph, the school would need advance computers to run this system. The article does not state if this system will cost money or not, but if it does it will most likely be a ton of money. Most school corporations can barely afford new computers to keep up with present programs, so what makes this high-tech program any different? The school corporations would have to set up a lot of fundraisers and make a bunch of cuts in their annual budget. In the end they might have to let a few teachers go because they could not afford them anymore.

This system is not valuable in the classroom because. it is an invasion of privacy, computers aren't always right, and it will cost the school corporation a lot of money.

I am for this technology because it can help students learn more about school. The face emotion technology is mind blowing if it works. If you think about it the computer can tell when your happy or sad which is awesome.

So when your working on a subject on your computer and the computer sees that your sad its going to make it were your happy. If your happy then its going to make you stay happy.

It goes in to the it will be a 3-D computer modle to track your face. If that happens then they would have to get everyones face in the United States and everywhere else around the world. To me i think its cool.

To me I think its a really good thing to try and see if it works. If it can tell if your happy then i say lets go for it and make everyone happy and get the world into a positive world.

109FC36735A0,"In the article, it talks about how a computer can caculate everyones emotional expressions. Personally, I believe that it is kind of pointless for a computer to read someones face to tell what type of mood they're in. Easily, another person can look at your face to see what mood you're in.

In paragraph 4, it states that ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" For a computer to try and caculate a person's mood or facial expression is pointless. A regular human being can do the same thing. Having a computer trying to figure out someones mood is just similar as someone else doing it.

Just because it is a device or technology figuring out a person's mood doesn't mean it is correct. Normally you would think since a laptop or device is advanced, that it could easily tell a person's current mood. In which, I dont agree with that at all.

Basically, I do not think the use of this technology is valuable. Over all it is pointless from having a device to use for deciding someones mood. I think a person should experience finding out someone else's mood themselves instead of using a pointless device. Using a device to me is basically cheating, and it could all be better by a regular person figuring out emotions on a person's face.      ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2

In the article it states that ""we humans perform this same impressive ""calculations"" everyday"" when actually you just sense it or study their face to see which emotion you can see through their eyes or facial expressions. We don't need a computer to detect our emotions when we could say how were feeling and not have a computer tell for us. In the article it states that ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" I pretty much don't beileve a computer can detect emtions from our faces when we could use a computer for many other things instead of emotions. What about our other emotions? gulity? curious? love? etc. How exactly can a computer detect our emotions? When a real human can detect it by the look of our face and talking about it.

In the ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" article they could find the percent of emtion the artist was feeling just by the way the picture was painted. Do you think its okay to use this sysem in a school setting?

I think its okay to use it in a school setting because it can see the true emotions the students feel. ""For instance, you can probaly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble acually decribing each facial trate that conveys happy"" I thinks its a good idea to have because, some kids really suffer from deppersion and sadness and this computer program can help them get the help they need and to be happy again.

Next, what the computers can do is crazy, they can read your emotional expressions when you are trying to hide them. ""Using video imagery, the new emotions-recognition software tracks these facial movement- in a real face or in painted face of Mona Lisa."" These computers can read everyones exact emotions.

When the program gets implemented into schools it may actually help students learn better. In the text it is explained that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", meaning that it can be used on almost any one.

B6EEC01CA171,"For many people, including myself, we have days when we are happy, optomistic, and just in a good mood for whatever reason. Then we have days where are sad, pesemistic and overall just in a bad mood.

On paragraph eight of this paasage it states that faces don't lie. while I do think that is true I do not think we are at a point where this technology can be accurate enough for us to be able to determine our emotions. Although I do not think it is accurate right now I do believe that in the future technology will able to accurately read our faces and find our emotions and this article shows why and how it is possible.

The first way that this passage shows us how emotion reading is possible is by bringing us an example in paragraph one of the Mona Lisa. The paragraph says that she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This example right here is meant to show us how the technology can work but brings us more questions that we hopfully get answers for. In paragraph three lots of backround information is given to us so that we can get an idea on how they were able to determine what the emotions of the girl in painting are. the author talks about the main emotions humans show and how technology can now allow us to mimick the muscles that humans have in their face and the movments they can make. In paragraph four the author elaborates a bit more on the technology and how it can be used to search for those mixed emotions. The author cites quotes from Dr. Huang, one of the main people behind the project, in order to give insight to the readers who may not fully belive that reading emotions through technology is possible. In paragraph five it states that if everday normal humans can also read at the very least the basics of human emotions based on how a human looks. It could most certainly be possible for a computer to do it but better as well. In paragraph six Dr. Huang talks about the possible futures this technology can go with more advances. He says that if your computer can read your emotions it can help a student with their homework or exlcude ads that do not appeal to that person. He also discusses about how versatile the technology is and that it can be used in order to improve the facial exressions for characters in video games while maintaining a more realsitic look that many video games have. In the last two paragraphs it shows how you can try to recognize some emotions yourself like a computer would.

I do think that this technology will go somewhere and has the potential to be able to with the rate that it is going. Being able to read the emotions of the girl in the Mona Lisa is already an impressive accomplishment.

People would say that when they are or were in school that they were had some type of emotion about the lesson that htey were going to learn. ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confude or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts"" (paragraph 6).

With the Facial Action Coding System the teacher would really have to do much and figure out how to change the whole lesson but still have the same content and have it in the same time length as planned.

To help students understand in the classroom the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable by reading the students expressions.

How we showed emotions throught our and nothing else and now days we have emoticans and what not?

Now we have a computer that reads us. How weird is that? We did not need this but now we seem to have. Kids now days email their teacher in order to get help when not so long ago we had Saturday school to tutor those that needed help. This computer is going to help teacher supposedly read tyhe face expression children make has they are exlaining the lesson. That way they can go back and see who makes expression of confusion and does not.

This will help those kids that are to afraid to say thye need help. See a childs ego can be pretty big when it comes to their education believe it or not. A kid could be too afraid to ask for help because they have a feeling they can do it on their own. The computer target each motion the face makes or when ever a muscle is different or changes in a face. A teacher/studenet relationship is now going to followed up by a computer screen. Won't be long untill the robots take over.

This computer program will probably make it easy for other people to see how they feel towards one another. Maybe some will like the answer and other will not.

Thats great but honestly I dont think this would be the best thing in the world.

The article asks us ""Does your exspression in the mirror suggest an emotion?"" Of course it does, just sometimes we may not know what kind of emotion it is. Sometimes you may not be able to tell it on your face but you can definitely feel it.

Other people do not need to know what is wrong with you, rather you are upset, sad, angry or happy. If you have a smile on your face, thats great, the other person thinks your happy even if you arnt. If I want someone knowing what I am feeling, I am going to tell them. I dont just want them or some computer reading my muscles in my face and telling me what emotion I am feeling.

What if the computer messes up the facial exspression and does something ""different"" to try to ""help"" that kid, but honestly the computer detected the wrong facial exspression and changed the lesson for the kid, when he really understood it.

8CB99587A792,"Use of FACS in the Classroom

Isn't it just the worst when you're frustrated with your homework, but your teacher doesn't seem to get the hint? This is why the Facial Action Coding System was created, or partly. The Facial Action Coding System would indeed be valuable if used in a classroom. It could be useful to kids, teachers, and parents of students. The FACS would be useful to change course of the lesson, or to help teachers decide on lesson plans for following years.

The FACS uses it's technology to evaluate the expression of Mona Lisa-- a painting. If the machine can figure out a non-living painting's emotion, then what could it do on humans? The FACS focuses on facial muscle movements to interpret the emotion of each item it scans. In the classroom, this could help kids by determining whether they understand. If a kid frowns, it can be obvious to the internet instructor that the student isn't understanding what they're being taught. The instructor can then go into deeper detail on how to finish a homework assignment.

In the case of boredom, it can help increase average scores. The software can determine whether a student is bored or not. If a student is bored, they will not pay much attention to the lesson, fall asleep, or maybe even shut it off. It is important to make sure the students are having some sort of fun with what they're being taught. The software could detect boredom and the online instructor would know to put more animations in the lesson, or even change the sounds and add music or a new polytone voice.

This software can also identify mixed emotions. If a student somewhat understands a lesson, but is also bored with it, the instructor knows to create a more lively detailed presentation. It's important to have a reader of mixed emotions in a classroom because of the amount of uncertainty in student's minds. It can also help the instructor know what lessons students understand and which ones they don't. The teachers can then decide what to do from then on, and/or next year, which ways the kids learn and which ways they don't.

The FACS is valuable in the classroom because teachers can change their lessons to fit each kids needs, and change their lessons for the following students next year. Each kid has their own personality, which requires different ways of learning. This software can almost guarantee improved scores in homework and tests because of how it helps teachers determine what the kids don't understand.

A7AF38D7EB8F,"Introduction-

People, Muesums, and Schools are still wandering ""to this day"" if Leonardo Da Vinci made his famous painting of Mona Lisa with a smile on ""her"" face, well, in Paragraph 1(Lines 1-2), there is a descripion of how Nick D'Alto is saying that Mona Lisa is Eighty-Three percent happy, Nine percent disgusted, Six percent fearful, and Two percent angry. The new technology system being described in the

Facial Action Coding System (suggested by Dr. Huang) could possibly make a big difference of how Mona Lisa ""REALLY FEELS"", and how it would be easier for students to learn about whether or not ""She"" was made ""HAPPY"" in Da'Vinci's paintings.

Body Paragraph-

Some students in the Twenty-First Century are not willing to learn about certain topics in school because of all the other amazing internet resources and games they think are part of computer freedom, but inspite of Three- Dimentinal vision, Mona Lisa could have been much angrier than what she might have seemed like in her face, and she might have been fearful because of her hair style and her looks ""in the dark!"" Maybe, there was a possibility that a demostration of Mona Lisa could test how well with a(n) computer with ""2020 Vision Software"", or have a(n) emotional sensor flashdrive to attach to your PC Engine when you want there to be certain conducting over feelings from your computer technology. I think that this kind of technology is kind of un-realistic, but it would be a good source for what the person studying in will thinks about what he learned in the past ""Once enough of the Life-Story of the person has gone by."" In Paragraph 3 ""Lines 18-31"", I would imagine that constructing a computer that has a lot of functions and features could lack the knowledge of a person's understanding of how to ""USE"" the computer properly, which will turn out to be more like ""TRASHWARE"" than ""SOFTWARE"". The biggest part I think the Facial Action Coding System ""Is Worth"" is how you can just control anything in your ""IMAGINATION"" to discover the strong ways that you can make video games from your imagination, show how you truly feel, and picture yourself "" in that video game."" Dr. Huang is not a bad ""Pre- Innovator"", but he could have added specific date(s) to his context.

Conclusion-

If a type of computer with 3-D software were to exist, then there would be a great possibility that by Two- Thousand Twenty, there will be the greatest chance of a computer with special features existing ""if Dr. Huang will start planning how the computer he's wishing to come out will be invented.""",1,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.0
34AF94722281,"I believe that the Facial Action Coding System can be a valuable asset to student in a class room . The System can read the face of the student to give feed back to the teachers on the lesson plan . It can be used to notify the teacher when a student in the class is upset . The System can also make learning ""fun"" for the students . There may many counter arguements but allow me to explain why .

My first reason it can be a valuable asset to students in the class is that it can give feed back on the lesson . In the text it says "" A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming bored or confused"" and it also says "" Then it could modify lesson, like an effective human instructer"" . This means that when a student is not getting the criteria the Fscial Action Coding System will read their facial gestures and make the assignment easier or more understandable . People may say "" This system wouldnt be balanced because some people may be of grade level "" . My claim is that the point of the system is to help them understand the criteria that they are learning to help them get back on grade level .

Another reason this system will be great is because the system can notify the teacher when the child is upset . With this advanced technology we can prevent alot of things from happening in school . In the text it says "" Most human communication is non-verbal , including emotional communication "" . The system can identify this and notify the teacher to talk to the student about his or her feelings . I believe the system can be a great asset to all the bad emotions or feeling going around school .

My final reason is that it can make learning ""fun"" for kids . Majority of the time students find the lesson plan boring , the system can read thier emotion and make it fun for them . In the text it describes how it can take the learning games and make them funner and more interacting . People may say "" School is not about having fun "" but students still need some type of entertainment even in highschool . The whole point of this system is to make the student adapt to the lesson plan , in a fun learning type of way .

The Facial Action Coding System will be a valuabe asset to students in a classroom . The system can adjust lesson plan or criterea for the student . It can help notify the teacher when a student is upset . It can also help make the lesson plan fun for the students .

B6428F6EB5F3,"Technology has come a long way from one hundred years ago. As it adavces more and more things can be used to help benefit in any of situations such as in classroom settings. The article by Nick D' Alto ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D' Alto tells how the Facial Action Coding System can help in any situation as it can even read students' emotional expressions in a classroom.

The article informs people the technology uses the major 44 muscles in the face. When the face moves it can detect which muscles are put into use and identify them with one the six basic expressions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These basic expressions off diversity more than just the basic happy and sad, and also account for most emotions. To make sure this is even more effective the given expression is put againts a neurtral face for a comparison. By giving a neutral face and an expression it gives a independent and depent variable. This would ensure a correct basis rather than just giving the face with an expression. It would also be able to tell if a student were enjoying a lesson or not. It help the teacher too see what topics they could make more interesting.

Some people might ask how can it detect emotions accureslty if somone fakes an emotion, but facial muscles do not lie. For example the frontalis pars lateralis muscle indicated suprise though a raised brow. A raised brow would indicate to the teacher that a student had mostly likely just learned something new. If several students had this expression the teacher could decide to keep incoorperating it in the lesson. The zygomatic major is the main indicator of a fake or real smile. For a real smile the mouth is lifted at the corners whereas in a fake smile the mouth stretches sideways. This would show if a topic was enjoyed by a students or disliked. It could also tell which topics students prefered more than other.

""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", an article by Nick D' Alto, tells how the new technology, Facial Action Coding System, can read expressions of a student. Once technology advances even more it would be able to help out in an array of settings, and even be able to detect more accurate, specific emotions.

It would be great to have the students potentially have the best classroom experience possible, but that is not always the case. The system is a great idea, but it may not work for everyone. After all, it is technology, so it is not guaranteed to work one hundred percent of the time.

Many things can go wrong with the FACS. Not everyone has the same shape of face or the same shape of muscle in their face, so can it really tell the exact emotions of everybody? Computers are great things in our world, but they do not always work the way you would want them to. This software would most likely have bugs and glitches for a while before they even come close to perfecting it. Many things can go wrong.

The article states that humans perform these ""calculations"" everyday. Why do we need a computer to calculate our emotions when students can go to a classroom and have an actual human teacher? The article provides much great and helpful information and pros to this software. Logically thinking, people can come to the conclusion that they do not need a computer software such as the FACS to cope with their emotions. The FACS may be valuable to very few people.

The FACS is just showing how people are not developing the social skills they should have. In the article, Dr. Huand states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". Students should just go to class and have a real human teacher so they can ask them for help if they are confused or bored. Computers should not have human qualities that sounds ridiculous. Dr. Huang also never mentioned what the FACS would cost either, it could be hurting peoples' pocketbooks.

The use of the FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. As stated earlier in the essay this is what real humans are for. This is also coming from a high school student who does not take online classes. This software would not be much help to the students who go into school everyday and see real life teachers and not computers.

The facial expressions for each emotion are universal.

New software has been developed that improves the accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The new software can now detect exactly how other people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their emotions. Facial Action Coding System has promising applications for a variety of industries. Mona Lisa being on of the pictures used to detect her emotions that were captured long ago.

Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. If the Facial Action Coding System was apart of the classroom, it will essentially distract students from their work. If school corporations were to bring Facial Action Coding System into the school, I personally think the schools should make it an elective class due to the fact that it may make students distracted from their work.

The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."" Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of the Facial Action Coding System classified the six basic actions as happiness, surprise, amger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

During the process, each expression is compared against a neutral face, also showing no emotion. Although, I think that having the Facial Action Coding System in schools, we perform ""calculations"" on one another each day. Humans can tell when a friend is feeling ""down"" or simply having a bad day. Just like when humans are watching movies, one can figure how the person is feeling by watching the actions around them happening or by their expressions presented on their face.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. ""A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. Having a computer in a room would also help modify the lesson as if the teacher were there. Today, most human communication is nonverbal, including emotion communication making it almost impossible to figure out what one is thinking or saying.

According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even produce them. Each person expressed their emotions differently. Empathy may happen because we unconsiously imitate another peroson's facial expressions. Designing the Facial Action Coding System helped humans learn the process of changing facial expressions and reading each others minds and emotions.

This can help students and adults to see how they are actually feeling because some people don't even know how they feel. Some students might say ""that computer doesn't know how I feel"" but the computer FACS(Facial Action Coding System) comes from a good sorce. The people who created ""FACS"" were Thomas Huang and Prof. Thomas Huang was from the Beckman institute fo advance at the University of Illinos working woth Prof. Therefore, they the system ""FACS"" is a trust worthy computer to identify your emotions.

This system can help students with their lifes. To demonstrate, in paragrapg 3 it states ""Eckman classified six basic emotions happyiness,suprised, anger, disgusted, fear,and sadness."" when a student is feeling depressed (no students should feel like that) a teacher doesn't know how the student is feeling out of the six basic emotions that Eckman descrided. Thus, the system will help teachers know how the student is feeling ;and if the student is not feeling good the teacher or the adult can ask why are they feeling that way and build a conection or a bond with the students.

Teachers can find this system useful because when they are teaching they can see if their students are confused or bored. To illastrate, in paragraph 4 it states "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements"" which means that using video or images is a new way to find out how people are feeling. Therefore, teachers can see how their students are feeling and see if their class is boring or not and they can see if their stuents are learning anything.

Technology being able to determine students' emotion would be extremely benefitial in helping the student fell better and being able to share their emotions.

Using devices to read our emotions would help frowning students smile more when they need it. The computer would be able to read their face by seeing the facial movements and determine whether a student is becoming bored in class. According to Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, having a computer that can read emotions in class "" could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor""(D'Alto 6). This could improve the student's learning skills and can help the teacher be notified when and where a student needs help.

This technology would not only be benefitial in the student's school life, but also in his or her personal life too. Computors would be able to see if a student was truely unhappy or upset and would be able to help in a way a human could not. The student may not want anyone to know of their sadness, but a computor knowing is harmless. Depending on the mood, "" if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (D'Alto 6). With this technology, when someones is upset, something happy and encouraging could pop up and make them smile. This could brighten a student's mood and encourage them to keep working with a better attitude going out than going in.

The ability to know how someone is feeling without them having to say it could make it easier for people to jump in and help each other out. If one student sees another who was putting on a fake smile, they may be able to encourage them or say something nice to put a real smile on their face.

I like the idea that they did but I honestly don't think it would matter or change the way kids are gonna feel in school. Reading students emotions in class would help the teacher or staffs know how the students are feeling, but that wouldn't change the fact that they are in school. Students that are giving work will most likely feel a little angry inside. Teacher and staffs should be able to tell if a student is happy or sad. Not all teacher or staff can tell, but just looking at the students mouth or orbicularis tighten around their lips should show that they are angry or happy.

I say sort off because, for one, you never know what a person is going through. If the computer can tell someones emotion why not see how they're feeling. If they're sad or depressed maybe you can help them in someway. But also, people might not want you to know how they're feeling. So using the computer's app, that is kind of disrespecting them in a way because they dont want you to know their emotions.

Also, I still think it is valuable because like a I said if they're sad you can help them. Even if they don't want you to know, you can still help them secretly though. They will recieve help without even knowing that they're getting help. Little do people know, alotof people who are sad tend to smile the most and just look happy.

I think specialists should be the ones to use them because they can be the ones to help people and they actually know how to do so. In the passage it talks about how in some people it is easy to tell by their face expression what they are feeling. But sometimes it is hard, and i agree. That is why I do think it is very valuable to use the computer.

Lastly, I do think its useable. It helps by letting us know who is depressed or stuff like that.

With this new technology it observes the face that will look at your face and look at all the muslces in the face and calculate it to see how you are feeling even if you try and hid it. Everthing is about the muscles in your face that can conduct how you are feeling. In this article it talk about how they tested this by using video imagery where they had people use a computer and they would flash pictures and the device would examine the face to see how they were feelng. They had did this a few times to test it.

In conclusion, they should use this to read studnets emotions because they maybe depressed and it could save lives. If someone is to angry they cold harm soemone but with this new technology this can prevent many things like that. They can detect things like emotions because the machine looks at the muscles on the face to determine weather you are sad, happy, angry etc; ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

5C7ADE4CBDE6,"Is the Facial Action Coding System really worth it to put it in schools and other places. This new idea can tell how you're feeling by just the scan of your face. There is alway error in such things known as technology. The idea of a scanning machine can tell how I feel seems a little different.

I don't believe this type of machines should be in our schools. I feel like this could cause confusion anf distrut form kids who don't like it. Sometimes kids like to keep to themselves and don't want some tecaher walking around taking pictures. How do we know if this is truly right. lets say that some kids get areading that they're happy or super sad when really they don't feel like that at all. There's to much error to have happen that it just doesn't seem worth it. If this has actually never been trieed on a living human who says it works. How do we know that Mona Lisa really felt like that. She can't tell us that she's dead.

With schools we need to worry on more important stuff. at times we seem to wonder why we lose out on so much money this just doesn't seem like a good investemnt. There is to much that can go wrong and not enough that can go right. Maybe later on if this was perfected but for now I don't support this. Maybe one day this will work out I just don't see it anytime soon becoming the next big thing.                                         ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
76BB36EE4398,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author introduces a new form of technology, the Facial Action Coding System. The new technology allows computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology will not be valuable to students in a classroom because it will be expensive, communication skills will be lost, and technology is not always accurate.

As it is now, without this new technology, some schools barely have enough money to buy basic supplies needed to provide a proper education for the students. If the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is added in the classrooms it will be another expense that is not neccessary. In the passage it says, ""Your home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisas smile."" This statement implys that, in order to use FACS, the school will have to buy not only the software, but also new computers that will support the system. That is a lot of money spent on unneccessary items when it could be spent on the basic supplies that most schools can barely provide now.

In today's world communication skills are bad enough already, with the current technology that students are surrounded by each day. In the passage it states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" If the new technology is added into the classrom and, to a point, taking the place of a teacher, communication skills will be further taken away. Teachers teach more than just science, math, or english to the students. Having a teacher in the classroom also teaches students how to communicate properly with adults and how to carry on mature conversations. Taking away that human interaction will have a negative effect on the students.

Technology is not always accurate. If this software makes an appearance in classrooms and students start using it, it could give false information. The pasage states, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vincis masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" Each person's face is compared to the exact same neutral face, which will not be accurate. Each person has a different neutral face, so in order for the information to be correct, it will need to be compared against each person's neutral face.

There are multiple reasons that the new software will not be beneficial to students in the classroom, however, there are a couple reasons that the technology will be valuable. In the passage it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts."" The computers telling the teacher that the student is confused could be beneficial because most students will not tell the teacher if they are confused, which causes them to get bad grades if they do not understand the material. If the teacher knows that the student is confused, they can take actions to make sure that they help them understand. Later in the passage it says, ""Empathy (feeling someone elses emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions."" The new technology could help students understand and have empathy, which will be a good thing. Lots of people do not have a lot of empathy in today's world, which is part of the reason why the world is a very cold place. Students having empathy could result in everyone treating each other better, if they can try to understand the things that their peers are feeling.

Overall, FACS will cause people more trouble and headaches than anything. After considering both sides of the argument, it is safe to say that the new technology will not be beneficial to students in the classroom because of the combination of it being expensive, taking away communication skills, and not always being accurate.

CB2D608AA358,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author starts off by saying the percentage of the different effects Mona Lisa has in her smile. He states that she's 83 percent happy , 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. The use of the new technology called "" The facial action Coding System'' in my opinion does not tell you how your honestly feelings. There is no way the computer can see the way you are feeling , just by smiling at the screen does not mean that you are happy. People smile at the screen all the time and has different feelings. Weather the computer can determain how you feel the only person how actually knows how you feel is you and yourself only. A computer can not recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel. There is no way the computer will let you know how you feel , the article is basically saying that just be smiling or looking at the computer it can determine how you are feeling. Once getting to paragraph 3 it starts saying how the facial Action Coding System works they start off by telling us how the process begings, "" the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face: all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" From that sentance in the article it is basacilly saying how the computer has a 3-D sensor on it, and when placing your head infront of it it will scan your muscles and from there determine the way you are feeling. As humans we perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. It is hard for a person to determine how ypu are feeling with just facial expressions , for example I could have a smile on my face but inside I could be feeling sad or mad and only I would know no one else. So the 3-D sensor they have on the computer to determine the way you are feeling is not true , a computer can never determine the way you are feeling it can never say that you are 5 percent happy and 90 percent sad , it does not work like that. Only you and you only know the way you are feeling and thats it. So no a computer can not determine the way you are feeling it can not determine the percent of nothing only you know how you feel and nothing else knows how you feel.

You can tell if they are interested in the current topic that is being teached, Next you can see if they are having a overall good day or bad day at school & finally you can tell if they could be stressed out about something in particular.

I think that it would be a good idea to use this in certain classes that are being teached with like new teachers, or with a new math subject that is currently really hard or easy to see how their overall current mood is at the time being when their face would be getting scanned into a 3-D model and constructs all the 44 facial muscles to see them clearly

Next, in my own personal thinking it would be a good idea to tell how a student is feeling and I think this could save lives, if the student is feeling anger,disgust,fear & sadness and maybe distruction I feel as this could help set up counciling and help the student in need and get him back to a good and happy state to be in and nothing bad might happen in the future.

Thirdly, having the technology to tell if the student is stressed out at home or in the school work place is mostly the best idea to ever have and to see if their are issues at home that is making him/her do bad on their school work. Next it would be good to have seeing a day before a test and seeing if students are worried about a test coming up the day before.

Finally, I believe that having this technology in school could possibly improve grades and overall morale of the school and make it a better and happy & fun place to be at, instead of being the area where we childern frown on and dislike going. Next, I think that having this technology in the classroom seeing if the students are enjoying the subject is a good idea & you could see if their having a good or bad day at school which could save lives in the very long run finally, you could tell if the student is being stressed out or just worried before the day of the test.

C60B2BD410BD,"The article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto presents an idea that a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System can recognize human emotion. The article mentions that It can determine your emotion even if you seem like your not trying to express a specific emotion. This would be extremely helpful in classrooms so that students can have a better learning experience.

In the classroom, students tend to let their minds to drift off and sometimes they get confused but they're to shy to say anything. With having this new Facial Action Coding System, the system could modify the lesson plan based on how the students feel about it. For example, Dr. Huang from the article says that, ""This classroom computer can recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This technology would also help the teacher learn more about their students so that they can help them when needed. This technology would play a big role in the future of schooling.

The Facial Action Coding System, is a different kind of computer. It determines your emotion which makes it different from the rest. This techonolgy plays a benefical addition to the classroom. If we incooperated them in the class, students would have a better learning experience and it would help the teachers learn more about their students!

ECE1DAD2A886,"Would you want a software to track your emotions? Facial Action Coding System is now enabling a computer to identify human emotions. This would allow your computer to read students emotions by weighting the different units to identify mixed emotions. As proven by Dr. Huang who studied human anatomy using the muscles to precisely convey emotions, I think this is a great idea.

First, by using Facial Action Coding System this will allow teachers and staff to know how a student is feeling during a test, or assignment. If a teacher knows how someone feels when taking an assignment they might go easier on the student in class, and give them extra chances to do the assignment at another time. Teachers don't always know what a student is going through. Every student is prepared to be ready for a test in a certain way. Some students often take a longer time than others. The recognition of a facial espression could easily tell a teacher how they were feeling about it all along.

Secondly, most students go through a lot at home, or even in school. Many students are diagnosed with many mental stabilities such as ADHD, ADD, anxiety, and so on. The guidance administration can help a student who has these mental stabilities by seeing how they feel while they do assignments, and tests. Seeing how a student feels would give them the chance to get help, and have them seperated from the room to help them focus on certain things. Not all students will come out about how they feel; Some keep to themselves and don't want to talk about there problems.

Finally, a computer seeing how you feel could make your day better. If your computer sees that you are sad it might put up a funny ad to make you laugh. If your computer sees that you are angry it might put up a calming, or soothing ad. If your computer sees that you are faking a smile it might put up something that will make you turn your fake smile into something real. Like Dr. Huang stated "" Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too.""

In conclusion, the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that enables computers to identify human emotions is a good idea. This will allow students to have a better shot on there assignment, or test in school. Usuing this will often give students more of a reason to smile, and feel more comfortable.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

But soon, we may be getting something that too personal and shouldn't be used for education purposes. FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is a an algorithm that can recognize facial features of a human being.

Why wouldn't the emotinal expressions of a student be valuable? Well, it's too personal. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Having a camera that can detect every one of your emotions while doing assainments on computers seems a little above and beyound, especially when you're just concentrating and maybe your facial features aren't really saying what your mind is.

""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" It only reads facial expressions, there's no information on why or what's making the student not enjoy whatever the student is doing, you dont know what going on in their head. Why have information only on the students expression when there's no reasoning behind it?

Many people speculate where it could be used, from marketing to video games. Some might wonder whether it could be used in classrooms, which is a definitive ""No."" FACS is not valuable to read student's emotional expressions because the classroom shouldn't include emotion, it has better uses elsewhere, and is invasive of privacy.

Emotion shouldn't dictate the lesson in schools. In the passage, Mr. D'Alto quotes, "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" (6). Everyone has walked into class one day, seen the lesson and then silently grumbled to themselves. This type of emotion shouldn't change what the lesson is or how it is taught. The goal of teaching techniques is to effectively teach the broadest audience. This type of system would switch up the lesson for the few people who get confused easily, but then it hurts the majority's learning experience. This is why the classroom shouldn't include emotion.

Systems such as FACS have better economical value elsewhere. In the passage, Mr. D'Alto says, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" (6). This is one example of other industries that could utilize this type of technology. In the classroom, there is no economical value of being able to read the students emotions. Mr. D'Alto goes on to say, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video surgery."" These are other industries that would love FACS-like technology. It's a better investment to use FACS elsewhere other than the classroom.

Privacy is held dear by many. FACS can be invasive of this. Some students may wish to save their grief for a counselor, therapy, or simply a designated time to cry. FACS completely disrespects this fact and exposes an individual to everyone else. In the passage, D'Alto quotes, "" 'Most human communication is nonverbal, uncluding emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too.' "" (6). This quote implies that computers are not yet able to comprehend whether or not the individual wishes to be ""scanned"", for a lack of a better term. This can be invasive. Until technology reaches a point until this changes, FACS should stay out of the classroom where students may not wish to have their emotions expressed involuntarily.

Overall this software is extremely useful for certain situations, but a classroom setting is not in need of this software. Many students are tired throughout the school day and are attempting to finish a lesson. Changing the online lesson may become aggravating to an older student especially. The Facial Action Coding System may not be as accurate for a classroom setting. Many people show no emotion when attending class, which may allow the software to read the emotion as bored.

When on a computer the Facial Action Coding System determines the way you feeling when the computer constructed 3-D face model revolves around all fourty four major muscles in a human face . When you show emotion towards the computer and have a movement of one or more muscles it is called a action unit which helps the com puter bring all your emotions together and be able to seperte them into they percentages .

The new technology can also relieze when something is bothering you . For example when your friend ask "" whats wrong ? "" and you say nothing your friend dictated that you were lying so his/her mouth would stretch sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle , the risorius hich means dont lie . Also it can tell when you are putting on a fake smile and actually hurting inside . The computer is actually showing empathy by feeling someone elses emotional state . Theory of emotion , moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them .

When struggling on a lesson on the computer the Facial Action Coding System will notice . However "" a classroom computer could relieze when a student is becoming confused or bored , then it will modify the lesson , like an effective human instructor ."" The same technology can make computer - animated faces more expressive - fro video games or video surgery . But also on the other note the new technology couldnt be the best idea due to the fact that some people are going through some stuff and school is a way to clear they mind and going on a computer at school with the new technology would remind them .

Many people dont relieze when their closest friends are going through something and the new technology would him .

For the most part she is happy you can tell she is happy becaus ehshe is smilling in the picture. What you can not see is the other emtions such as disgust or fear or angry. So how can the author really say that she is all those things if she. although it could be a fake smile you never know. That is like everyday life a person could look happy but really be sad or mad about something you never really know how a person is feeling unless they personally tell you. Facial expression are a big part of our world. As the author states, ""Even though indivulas often show varying degress of expression for example not smiling broadly.""

What I stated in my paragraph befor was that you may tell somebody that your really close with you feelings but then be smiling or not showing any emtion at all. The author states it later in the article. He states "" you can probalby tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.""

3D93701B4E8D,"The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The reason for this is that you can tell weather the person is really smiling or not. The computer software FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can classify 6 basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

The passage states that the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face;all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an 'action unit. The passage also states that using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnintion software tracks these facial movments-in a real face or in the painted face of Monia Lisa. It can even identify mixed emotions. Each exspression is compared against a neutral face. The computer can tell weather you are happy or sad. Like in the passage it says that for an example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it can modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.

The evidence from this passage shows that the use of this technology to read the emotional exspressions of students in a classroom is very helpful. like stated in the claim and passage ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2

The inventor thinks that this technology should be used in schools.

It would not valuable to have technology be able to read emotions of students in the classroom.

It would be helpful for students when they are confused, but that's the teachers job.

Teachers are there to help the students learn.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author quotes ""Then it could modify it's lesson, like an effective human instructor"".

This quote shows that with the new technology, teachers won't be needed.

Why would we need the computer to change the lesson when students can just ask for help from the teacher.

This technology should be used somewhere else more effective like at an airport.

In an airport, the video camera could see if the people are confused and then the computer could tell an employer to go help them.

That would much more valuable and then robots still won't have the power to put people out of jobs.

To have technology be able to read students emotions in a classroom would not be valuable.

There is already someone who helps students in the classroom so schools don't need another.

6F6F90FF64F5,"The ""Facial Action Coding System"" or ""FACS"" is not useful or appropriate in the classroom. Paragraph 6 describes that computers basically watch your face to see what ads to use and it could be used in the classroom to see what you understand however, it is not likely that a teacher would want for their lesson to be altered because that can create some problems. Having a computer scanning your face 24/7 could also be viewed as kind of wrong and invasive. On the other hand, if people knew they were being watched, they could easily change the appearance of their emotion. People can be very convincing. Lastly, technology is not 100% correct 100% of the time. Things could always glitch and change things for the worse.

Some might view the concept of a computer scanning your face every time you are in front of its camera as minamally invasive. Everyone has different facial expressions that show different things and it could mean the complete opposite of what the computer views it as. Paragraoh 7 describes that a computer can scan your face to see if there is an ad that you don't like and show less ads like that one. Not only does that have nothing to do with using it in a classroom, but no one likes ads in the first place and you have to pay to get them removed. Also, some teachers like to try and read their student to get a feel of how their day is or see if they're ""living their best life"". While this is sometimes very sweet, sometimes people like to be left alone when they're in a mood. This technology could literally increase the percentage of teachers being in people's business. They already have that Dyknow app that screen records all of our screen so they can see what we're doing at all times, why would they need to know how we're feeling as well?

As an actress and show choir student I can safely say that we, in the performing arts community, can definitely put on a faccade. Others may not be in either of those activities however, people can still be very convincing. Personally, if I knew I was being watched I'd probably fake some of my emotions. People on shows like ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Law and Order"" are paid to put on a fake face. Their job is to literally be fake for a camera. There are episodes of those shows where people are crying and they look very pained. Chances are, they are not really feeling those emotions. Arizona Robins may have cheated on Callie Torres but Jessica Capshaw didn't cheat on Sara Ramirez. That's fake emotion. They might not be it their character is so they have to play that part and be convincing or they don't get the part. In show choir there are songs where we have to be angry and then suddenly happy and then concerned all in a matter of sixteen counts and if we can to that then we can change how we portray our emotions when we are being watched by a camera.

There are so many different applications and softwares tha are in the world now and no matter how advanced the technology may be, it is never always perfectly running. Even the latest technology glitches from time to time. Technology is constantly updating and changing due to bugs in the software. Technology like this could ruin something completely. Everyone has a focus face that they put on when they're reading something or solving an equation. Let's say someones focus face looks a little bit angry. Just because their face looks angry does not mean that they don't like the question or don't like how it's taught or explained, it just means that they're focused on what they're doing. If the software misreads a facial expression and changes what's on the screen it could completely mess up what the student is doing. Or if the student does need the way of teaching adjusted and it does change. it could cause problems with the teacher because some teachers want things done a very specific way. If something happes with the software and it could inconvenience the student in many ways.

In conclusion, Facial Action Coding System should not be put in classrooms. IT's not completely useless, but it it's not very useful either. People don't need their face read to see how they feel about an ad or about a teaching style, that's why surveys were invented. If someone wanted people to know hwo they felt every time they turned on a computer, they'd start a blog. There are really bad actors on this planet but there are a lot of liars and pretenders. If a lot of people knew they were being recorded and faked a smile because they think that their privacy is at stake, it would completely defeat the purpose of the system and it would all be for not. Technology is also very expensive these days and this type of thing can easily be hacked or it could glitch and once again, defeat the purpose of the system.

This coding could be good for students and teachers. So lets say we do get this in classrooms, then the robot could tell if someone is having a bad day, or needs more help on something, just by reading their faces. Then the teacher would maybe help the student more or ask whats wrong, and get the student some kinda help.

If someone has an IEP the robot could tell the teacher that the student needs more help on this on subject. The robot could possible help the student understand it. If the student stil doesnt understand the problem or the subject, the robot could go and get him/her and say to them "" So and so needs your help on this problem or on this subject."" And the teacher would go help them.

Well the robot could malfunction in the middle of class and and go roge and start herting people. Well if that happended then their would be someone on stand by to turn off the robot and start working on him. So the robot could get back as fast as he could.

It also explains how technology called the (Facial Action Coding System) can identify human emotions. Here's the question, is the new technology(Facial Action Coding System) worth using it?

First of all, the new technology sounds cool and all that stuff, but how would this be used? Some advantages about the technology is that you can find out what the student's emotions are. For example, what if the student is not speaking when asked a question? That would be a good time to use the technology. Another advantage is to find out what a baby's emotion is, that way it'll be easier to take care of the baby.

Disadvantages about the technology is when and where will this be the best time to use this technology in the outside world? Would this technology work best in public? Probably not in my opinion, because why would people used this out in public? True it may help when people are in danger, but not using the technology proper, yeah, that's just a waste of money.

Another thing to mention is that this technology would only work in computers for right now. Students can detect other student's emotion with this technology. This would be a good use in group projects, but other than that it's basically useless. Not trying to be rude or anything, it's just that who has the time to use this technology? People are allow to use it but they'll probably not use it properly.

In conclusion, I think that the new techology(Facial Action Coding System), is pretty useless. Who has the time to use this? When or where can this be used?

86FD29FA8938,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a good idea for the studetns in the classroom. It may be good for many different other things, for example if someone needs help or in danger as in they could be crying showing that they are scared. But I feel they should take it a little more exstreme for things like could also have audio and could really help with peoples lives. Not even the bad emotions if you are happy or exicted it can sense that and something good could happen.

One reason I believe this would work because there is so much danger and anything can happen and we could use extra protection. But I also feel that it could be more to it then just looking for emotions. Even if they are good emotions there should be something to say or something should light up when the senseor feels that you are happy.

They should test it out and see how it goes and turns out for some people and if things go good the they should move it to the next step and add audio and see how much it makes a impact on peoples lifes.

Another reason I feel that it might work is because sensing peoples emotions is great. Peoples emotions shows alot it can say so much about their personality or how they feel about life, it could even gives you signs about that person and could get people aware so they can put thst person in a safe place if they need to. There should also be bounderies because most people arn't gonna want a computer screen or phone screen watching them, their emotions or even listening to them. But to even fix that you could always have were you could turn the senseor on an off just so people could feel more surcure.

Overall my thought about the Facial Action Coding System is great. You can take it so far and you can keep it how it is. Even if graphing shows that people don't like it I still think it is a good idea for me thinking saftey wise.

31465D2CACDF,"Computers are one of the best inventions ever made by humans because they have enabled everybody around the world to connect to the Internet. The Internet fuels most peoples lives because of the sheer amount of accessible information about anything and everything. However, should we let computers start making their own decisions? Thomas Huang is the creator of a computer software that allows computesr to read human emotions using 3-D modeling and analyzing muscle movements in the face. At first glance, this appears to be an interesting concept, but there could be several downsides to this type of invention such as overall practicality, implementation in today's society, and even safety and security issues.

First of all, is a software that can read our emotions actually useful? There is potential for this type of software to be used on people for occasions such as a interrogation where the suspect could be lying and the software could detect a quivering lip. On the other hand, this type of software is most likely not going to make it into the homes of the people which presents a business problem. Their solution is to introduce the software into schools to be used for enhancing the learning experience. Dr Huang describes how computers in the classroom could ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor"" resulting in a better learning environment for the student. The issue is, not every student needs this, and many will prbably disagree with having this software implemented in their school. So, this type of computer software has few areas that it will probably be used causing it to be less practical than it originally seems.

Secondly, how will FACS (Facial Action Coding System) be implemented into a society that is normally unwilling to new changes regarding their technology? People want improvements, but they don't want change. For example, when an application has an update most people update it without giving it a second thought because the newer it is the more likely it will be ""better"" than the previous version. But, when a new phone comes out with plenty of changes people are skeptical and wait for their friend to buy it before they consider purchasing one themselves. So, as a result, people will most likely be skeptical of a software that is able to read emotions because it is something new and no one has any experiences with it yet. This causes FACS to seem like a software that won't be implemented or at least widespread for a long time.

Lastly, will the common person feel like their privacy is being invaded with this new software? For FACS to work the user must have a camera or some kind of scanning device that is able to detect individual muscles. A highly accurate scanning device in the common home will most definitely scare some people out of having this type of software. For example, some people believe that they are already watched through their smartphone camera even though they don't have any form of evidence of such actions taking place. A natural fear of invasion of privacy is part of human nature and cannot be changed. In paragrpah seven D'Alto, the author, mentions that FACS can detect a fake and a real smile which only solidifies the softwares scanning precision. What if someone was talking with their boss using their computer and they lied to protect their job? Although this kind of action should result in that person being punished or fired FACS could use the camera on the computer to see that they were lying and report it to the person's boss or company. Now, this situation is impractical and hopefully it never happens, but the idea that FACS has the ability to use a camera in the home to do whatever they want is scary and will drive people away from using it.

In conclusion, FACS will probably be used for specific tasks only, but it is interesting to ponder the potential for similar softwares in the future. The main problem that Dr. Huang will face is trying to show the people the trustworthiness of the product. If there is too much skepticism from the people it simply won't be found around the world and rather only in more secluded places such as labs or research facilities for testing purposes. In the future, other softwares will be created and maybe they will have the potential to impact the world in influential, innovative, and successful ways.

3DB1BD9129DB,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" a man creates a program that can detect human emotion. That man is Professor Thomas Huang. The program he created can detect on how a person is truly feeling. I only know 6 emotions so far and they are happiness, anger, sadness, surprise, fear, and disgust. The program could lead to major scientific/artistic break throughs.

The program uses muscle identification to determine what emotion the person is making. A specific muscle is used to make an emotion. For example, the zygomatic major is used to move the lips up to make a smile. The zygomatic major and the risorius is used to force a smile like if you feel awkward, depressed, or upset but doesn't want to show it. So even the program can tell if you are forcing a smile or you are actually happily smiling.

Expressing emotions everyday could improve how you actually feel and you may get more out of life than you would with a straight face. People will think you are are happy if you smile, sad if you frown, content if you have a straight face, etc. People analyze how you are feeling to share iin your happiness, make you feel better so you are no longer sad, and calm you down if you are angry.

7122E7C97417,"Do you think technology is helping the future generation? Yes, I think technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom. It can help you with your school work, tell what you are feeling at that given time, and it can help scientist into developing more scientific inventions for the future. A lot of people don't like technology because it takes the old inventions away from the new inventions. In my opinion, I think it's very helpful for this generation because we can teach people older than us more new develpoed thoughts and processes for the future ahead of us.

First, technology can help students in the classroom because of their emotional face expressions. In the article Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" For example, if you smile the computer will put a similar subject on the page, if you frown the computer will change the topic. Instead of students telling the teachers they are bored in the classroom, the computer will know and it will try and help the student out so they aren't so bored.

Second, technology can be like a friend to us. Today's technology is so advanced that if we need to ask questions, we can ask our phones and they will give us the answers. Friends can tell what you are feeling just by the facial expreesions that people give off on their faces. That's what the computer is trying to do in order to help people out.

Third, technology is what we use in our everyday lives. People are finding new ideas and ways to make technology even bigger and better so it's easy for us to use. New inventions are being thought of everyday. This is an invention that has been thought of and brought for us to try out and it might not be in generations for long but it can help us learn a lot about ourselves and how we feel. Technology is there for you so it's easier and you're no so stressed out when trying to do things in life.

In conclsuion, I think technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom because it can help with school work, what you are feeling, and it can help the people around you.

"" A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" that detail would be exstreamly valuble, if it became real in the future. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor"". Can you imagine of how student problems can solved, now with this new piece of technology?

However, a good side may also have bad side. Technology is still growing and becoming more useful then ever, we use techology everywhere, for daily life plans,communicating,playing games even shopping. With those pros, come with cons, technology also has become a tool for unkindness like cyber bullying, not only that. But sick minded people, who find ways to spy on others inside their private homes through their computer cameras. Yes, their are simple remedies, like put your computer away with the top down, or when your on soical media. Don't give friends your password or post anything you know would be harmful, so a perosn can hack into it, connect to wifi's that don't allow EVERYONE to connect to them, because (it does'nt happen all the time) a person with the right system can see what your doing on your phone.

In a conclusion, my point is now, that scientists want computers to

""'calculate' emotions"" . Hackers COULD find a stronger way, to make things dangerouse for people by reading their emotions through the person's private computer (unless this idea only stay in school sytems). Now, I know I may sound paraniod or even carzy, but if we're honest technology is scary. Not saying we should never use it or through it away, of course not ,it's become people's life blood now, we it for everything. More over, it's the people behind the techonogy that do the harm. Not the technology itself. I just really don't want to give more unkind people a better chance of physicaly or emtionaly hurting someone.

At the end of the day, I just don't want to give more unkind people like bullies,hackers and others be given a better chance of physiaclly or emitonaly hurting someone. It's great if scientists to come up with new ways to save people through techonogy, reading a perosn's emotions can fix things and not just for children but young adults, adults the elderly .Even people with specal dissablities, if their being tested, a computer can tell if they understand through the emitionals they give infront of the computer. I just want it to have a postive effact rather then a negitve one. ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
F13CB30C118B,"Its valuable to use a technolgy that can read the emotional expressions of a student. I find it important to know how someone really feels and what they may be going through. For an example, many people hide what they truly feel, because of what others think. I have a great friend that really does not express themselves when we go out and hang, she always seems to be bored. The reality is that she has fun and likes the things I like, She may seem like she is bored, but you can tell when she is enjoying herself, she makes a small smile and looks over to the other side when she does not want me to see that she is having fun.

Having Leonardo da Vinci's painting of Mona Lisa is a great way to tell others an expression of all six basic emotions. The way Leonardo used his painting to get every single muscle to go with its roll in each six basic emotional expression of Mona Lisa.

We all have six basic emotions, which are: happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and saddness. It is a surprise knowing when we humans are surprised an expression is shown in our faces, in the third paragraph the author says "" your frontails pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrow"" when you're surprise. The most common facial expression is happy. In paragraph 7 it talks about how the instructions above were a happy face instuction, it also includes how their is a difference between a real and a false smile. Us humans have real emotional expressions. Our true expression never lie how we truly feel, as said in paragraph 8 "" faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politican or celebrity isn't being truthful.""

In todays world many people express themselves and many people don't. In the reality many people hide what feel and make a lying expression, with noticeable information on the lying expression. In instance in paragraph 7, with the instuctions of making a smile, Having a false smile is different than a real smile. For example, in paragraph 8 the author talks about the muscle in the smile, "" muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make a crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This tells how a false expression can be noticable and yet use to make a lie.

A technology that can read an expression of a student would be great, so that a teacher may know how a student is feeling and can help or observe. As known many famous people lie about how they feel and we as humans are no different than a celebrity. We all have emotion expressions that we express and falsely express to fool someone. Helping the ones who are sad and angry, fear and disgusted to succed and the ones who feel happy to succed as well.

Having the technology that can read emotion expressions in a classroom of student is valuable. Since most students don't want to express their feeling phiscally. These are my reasons why having a technology to read the emotional expression of students in a classroom is valuable.       ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

12F6CA9D6104,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."" The author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions, Which could be a good idea for students in school.

The Facial Action Coding System could come in handy in many ways. If a student is at school and they are watching a video online where a person is trying to describe something or inform them of something and they are confused and the computer notices it, it could show them to another website that could help them understand it better. It could also inform a teacher that a student needs help. Another reason this would be a good idea is if a student isnt having a good day and they are upset and the computer recognizes it, then the computer could transfer them to a page that could cheer them up and put a smile on there face, which could help them get through the school day. It could also send a signal to a teacher that could lead to help from them. Another reason i suggest this tool is if a student gets very upset about something and the computer notices it, then it could help a teacher get a councelor if the student is having problems at home or with other people in the classrooms. The Facial Action Coding System could also come to help for students who might be suffering from depression and no one noticed the computer could help.

Therefore I think that using the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms is a good idea becasue it could lead to some positive outcomes.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

These classifieds 6 basic emotions of people like disgusted, happy, sad, fearful, angry, and surprise.

312C67D3E8B1,"Have you ever wondered what someone is feeling by just looking at their face? Now, scientist have discovered a new technology to read emotions. The new technology uses recognition of muscle movements in the face. This new technology would be valubale in a classroom with students because you could tell how the students really feeling, you could tell if they are faking emotions, and it could be a learning tool.

First, you could tell how the students are really feeling. In paragraph 9, the author states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" This means if a teacher sees an upset student, the teacher can tell them to make a happy face and eventually the student won't be as upset. It would help everyone be happy because everyone will ""... unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.""

Second, it would help show if anyone is faking emotions. In paragraph 8, the author says ""...these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This would also be helpful with students in a classroom because if student his trying a student is trying to hide being upset a teacher could know and then ask them whats wrong. Also, it would work the other way too. The teacher would know if a student would be faking being upset.

Lastly, it could be used as a learning tool. It could be a way of showing how facial muscles work and the emotions that are shown by them. In paragraph 6, the author states "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows that it would be able to help students learn based off of their emotions.

There many things in the new technology that would be valuable in a classroom with students. For instance, it help tell how students are feeling. Also it could tell if a student is faking a smile and is really upset. Finally, it would be a helpful learning tool by changing lessons by the students emotions.

When looking at a person u can tell if they mad sad or really down , and for technology to do that there is no reason we should have a computer knowing were mad, happy ,or anger .

In article 5 for instance you can probably tell how a freind is feeling simply by the look on there face as the article say. In this community today most people just look mean . As Dr. Huang perdicts most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional coummication . But wen using a fake smile the mouth is streteched sideways . Nobody should use a fake smile just to caculate that they are happy.

I agree that using technology to read students emotional expressions is valuable because you can communicate more with your expression not just with people but also with computers. For example from text,""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communtication,""notes Dr. hang.""

It helps students because it shows the computer your emotion when you don't understand something and it's like a teacher seeing your face while you do work on something sam way it works on a compueter. Text from paragraph 6, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"",Dr. hang predicts.'' It can also be just a painting and it can show the emotions of the painting you can use it even identifys your mixed emotions, Text from passage,""Using vido imaginary, the new emotion-reconigtion software tracks these facial movements in a real face or a painted face of Mona Lisa.""

The same way you see someones expression when you talk to them is the same way the computer will show it, you may not always be accurate sometimes you may think they're sad when they're really happy same for compueters text from paragraph 5,""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried,ect.""

Using technology is valuable to students, it shows another way to communicate, it shows if your smile if real or fake, it's like other people are being able to detect your feelings even if you don't want them to see it. Students can also learn different expressions they thought they didn't have example from text,"" According to the facial feedback Theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them.""

The Mona Lisa is a painting that dosent show much of an exprestion within her smile, but we can somewhat make out that she is somehow is smiling but with another expretion with it. Fpr according to the computer softwar, the Mona Lisa is mostly happy within the picture but also has other fellings like disgusted, fearful and angry. What most people don't understand is that the software has identified that there are more to what meets the eye of an expretion in life. After having many sciencetist look into this, many have found that by making a smile has to create some kind of an exprestion that we can identifie without technology itself. not all emostion can be identified but at least there is a way to show them through actions.

What I say is that the technology that we us today is not always what we need in life to find out about a simple smile where we can just feel and see it with our own eyes.

82223F37DDCC,"In this passage ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author made very detailed and valid points about the use of technology detecting what our expressions say about our moods, but, technology reading students facial expressions is over the top. I belive that this new technology would force students to always want to force a smile so that the computer doesn't fully recognize their real from their fake. In this essay I am going to tell you about my opinions on why I think that this new technology is bad for anyone to even have.

First, I would like to say that this is a really good topic the author brings forth to the table, but who would want to feel like their being watched? ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This information is truly invalid. Smiling at an ad does not make it appear the next time you get on a different website, and frowning at an ad doesn't change it either. It's the way the ads are set up that it makes them leave or come back. Student's shouldn't have to feel like they have to fake their emotions just so that the computer doesn't recognize how they feel in reality. I do not believe in this ""new technology"" that seems to be changing the way we see ourselves. I would not want kids to feel like they are being watched or even judged on by what they look like through a computer screen.

Lastly, I would like to say that this point of view that the author is taking is a very good start, but thinking about the author feels versus the way every one else would feel puts this topic on hold. Not every one wants their child to be watched through a computer screen that's looking at their faces to show how they feel. If some one is happy on the inside but frowing on the outside then how would the computer sense that? Sometimes we hide our emotions on the indside and show neutral expressions to everyone else outside of our hearts and mind. Computers can only detect what they see and not what is actually going on. That is why I believe that the value of using technology to read students' emotional expressions should be forgotten.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

82721F205A18,"I think the Facial Coding System is valuable in a classroom. I think this because It can help out a lot. When a student doesn't want to explain thier emotions or don't know how to share emotions this system can be helpful and valuable. And I mean it is pretty cool that a facial system can calculate anyones emotions. And this FACS sounds totally unharmless.

In the article it explains how this system works. I will be wrtiting about how it works and get examples from the article. In the article it says that an action unit can calculate movement of one or more msucles and can detect the emotion. Dr. Paul, the creater of FACS states that he has calssified 6 different emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness all with the FACS. Examples of how the FACS can detect your emotion is in your face movements for example, as said in the story when your frontalis pars lateralis muscle raises your eyebrow when you are surprised; your orbicularis oris tightens your lips when you are angry. It is fantastic how this can know the emotion you are feeling.

I think FACS can actually be valuable in classrooms. A teacher can detect weither a student is happy,sad,angry, or surprised. It can be very useful for students that when they want to talk to thier teachers but don't know how to explain themelves this can help. FACS can help out in many more ways, useful ways.

I feel that it is a lack of privacy of what you think and that humans shouldnt rely on a piece of technology to change who we are, and as for this technology being for students i really dont think is a good idea at all. The reason why is becuase there could be students that prefer not to talk about there problems and this technology wont help them feel happier or any other emotion. Yes it will see that the person is angry about something but i feel that is not something to be said or written down for the public or teachers to figure out. If the student is ready to talk then the student will talk to you, not only that but thats what can create the bond between the teacher and the student and with that bond the student will learn to trust there teacher more better and for the teacher to trust the student better.

But with this technology, I feel like that would not be a good idea for teacher and student bonding, because then students would have a hard time trusting teachers because of the technology and if anything making student feel like they wont want to talk about there problems or anything at all because of the lack of trust that this technology gives them for teachers to figure out. If you want to know how the student is doing so badly then sit down and talk to the student about whats going on you should not need a device to detect what they are feeling. What would they gain from all that information how the students feel what is that suppose to do to make them happier making this sort of technology is a really big lack of privacy.

In conclusion i think having the Facial Action Coding System is a really bad idea especially for students becuase of the lack of privacy the students will have with there own emotions. Yes this sort of technology can figure out whats on there mind at the time but if the student is ready to talk to you about something then the student will open up to you making a better bond instead of having technology that pretty much forces itself to scan and recognize peoples emotions.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

Phone, laptop, computer, cars, etc. Each day a lot of inventors work hard to produce their invention to make the world better. Recently, iphone company just release a new iphone called iphone X that you can unlock the phone without using your finger, you can just look at the camera and the phone will recognize your face and open it for you. That is a really popular invention that everyone excited to buy and love to use. People create many new technology for it to communicate with humans like iphone X as an example. Thomas Huang professor of University of Illinois collaboration with Nicu Sebe professor of University of Amsterdam created a software called :""Facial Action Coding System."" The software were created because Dr. Huang said that he want to develop better ways for huamsn and computers to communicate. The software can recognize humans emotions. Either, you happy, sad, fear or surprise, the computer just look at you and tell what is your feeling right the way. Because Dr. Huang is a professor at University of Illinois, beside the software he just look like every professior that have to go to class and teach. As many people know, not every time you attend the class you understand what the teacher teach you. Sometime you get bored, sometime you get confused or tired. But all of that emotions you are the only one that know about it. With that in mind, Dr. Huang wanted to bring the software to his class so he will know his lesson is actually go through students mind or not. He will know the time to change the topic to make student more productive, more happy and enjoy in his lesson. Not just only him, every teacher in the world need this sofware, everyone want their students to happy to learn. More happy you are, more focus you are in the class. The Facial Action Coding System is a valuable software for school that help teacher recognize students feeling and that can make the class better.

Here is how it works. According to the article ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles"" This show that, we can believe in the result of the software after its read the emotions. Because the computer created a model of the face, with all muscles that humans has. When you move your face the 3-D model of the face will form exactly the same as your face to help the software recognize what is that emotion. One of psychologist and creator of FACS that work with Dr. Huang is Dr. Paul Eckman has classified there are six basic emotions :""happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" That is what emtions of a regular humans looks like. Either you happy because you got good grades, or anger because someone ate you ice cream that you save for a long time. They bring every emotions of humans in real life in the software to help help it easily recognize humans face. One of the example from the article is when your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you are surprised, or your orbicularis oris (around your moth) tightens your lips to show anger. The computer is really smart, just look to your face and form the 3-D it can easily show how mad you are, how sad you are. Even from the painting Mona Lisa of Leonardo da Vinci, the computer show she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fear ful and 2 percent angry. You can see how smart it is. If you mad and angry or surprise at the same time, the computer will still know and point of the percent of each emotions. When you make a fake smile, the software still recognize it. According to the article ""But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" You cannot lie to them, they already know exactly how you give them fake or real smile. Go back with Dr. Huang classroom. Why is FACS is a valuable software for study at school? Because when you are tired, bored or mad about something you cannot focus on the lesson or what the teacher or proffessor teach you. From that the computer will recognize your emotions and tell the teacher your feeling. Teacher cannot make you forget about your problems but they will create or find another way to make the class seem more fun or do more activities instead of just standing and read ore teach boring stuff that you don't care about. That's help you feel more comfortable, in that way when you feel happy and relax you can focus on your work more. All of the stuff that you learn will easily come to your brain and you will remember it.

The FACS is a great software for school. It can help teacher/professor a lots in their way of teaching students and from that students will focus more on the teaching time. Not just classroom, this could help many people around the world with whatever they do. Because sometime, humans being never tell anyone about their feeling, they just sad and angry but noone now about it. Using computer to communicate with them is a great ideas. Like an example in the article, when it recognize your emotions and know that you sad, it will find an ad or something funny that can make you laugh right the way. Since many people around the world using technology all the time, people should create more things that could help technology communicate with humans. Because it could help the world more modernized, help the people without family or friends feel better when they communicate with technology. Growth more technology will make the world better.

In this article the author explains how a couple of people from a university created a program to identify how someone is feeling. Some people might disagree on how these students are using technology to find out how someone is honestly feeling. I think this idea of using this program is a good idea for many diffrent situations.

In the article the author explains how student at a few university's have been developing a program to show how someone is feeling. Student's from the University of Illinois, University of Amsterdam, and Dr. Huang and his colleague's are all apart of creating this program. The article describes how the students created this program and how they tested it on the Mona Lisa. This is a good idea because this program could help a lot of people in there everyday life. This program could help out with people who might have dangerous jobs were people could hurt them badly. This program could also help people who love art get more information from painting they love, becaue they might see a painting and not know what the artiste was trying to say.

This article on how these men and women created a progam that could be useful could inspire others to created somthing they want. It might inspire others to get into science or programming. It could also inform someone who might be intrested in the product that it is developing and could become useful in a lot of ways.

7CC0BF28036C,Using technology to know expressions of students in a classroom is wrong because the one experiment which Dr. Huang did was on a painting was different and doing it on students is a different thing because it can really affect them in wrong ways. By knowing their emotional expression means playing with their feelings and that could make an huge impact on a students life and in these past mosern years there has never been an technlogical experiment done on a Human or a Student. So I think that it shoud not be done on students because they are the future and playing with them is not a good thing to do and it an also make an huge impact on them because knowing their expressions means knowing them and what they think and but by doing that the students won't even trust themselves on anything and that could it even hurt the students for their life and would be hard for them to come back.    ,2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2

Well there is a software that is the lastest innovation from professer. I think this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in classrooms is valuable because its important for students to know how students are doing and feeling. Some students probably dont want to talk about how their feeling because there probably scared or something . Some kids in school go through depression which is bad because if kids go through depression, some kids will commit sucide and we dont want that to happen. For that computers to read humans minds, it has to have all fourty-four major muscles like in a human , then it also has to move like what humans muscle do. In this new software or invention, it can track your facial expressions and movement. Which that is amzaing because I really want to help our other students or kids out so they wont go through sad,depressed,mad,etc.

My conclusion to this is that its very helpful to have a machine to read or can tell how kids are doing now. We dont want student nor kids going to think about committing suicdue. We lost so much syduents or kids because they are going bullying. If they being bullyed you can at least talk to them or try to have the new invention read their emotions.

Technology is used for entertainment, and creating ways of excitment in people. However technology is also used as a weapon in negative ways, like look at the internet for example; this form of technology is used for positive reasons and negative reason. However when used in positive ways the internet is and can be used a an amzing source of positivity and a benifital tool to those who use it.

Classrooms in america are getting more strict and incressing in difficulty mainly, due to the amount of difficulty it takes to master areas in which people want to succeed; like the job field for example now days jobs are harder to access therefore schools are tying to give their students an upper hand in this field.

Monotorying has always been a thing ever since it was possible, there are positive and negative sides to this phenominon. There are companies who use monotring as a negative thing; like say spying on an employs dailey activities besides work, however companies can use this form of monoturing on checking to see if there is something a employey has problems with a spesific thing at a job site.

Overall I think that technology along with it negative aspects can be a positive tool twards benifiting peoples lives, just like educuation. Educational staff are only seeking healty lives and suitiable jobs for those they teach and support. So therefor teachers and staff using technology is postitive ways can be a benifical tool.

Emotion tracking technology is a new advancement that could weave into a new direction and form of how our schooling sysetem works. this could be a very good thing for us a society as a whole. I personally thing that is a great idea for students that have near given up on schooling and the system itself.

Technology is used for entertainment, and greative ways of exciting people. Therefore in conclusion i do belive that using positive forms of technology to help further students learning and productivity is a major step in the right direction. Collages nowadays are only accepting students that are determinded and not afriad to go that extra step for themselves and others, and if teachers use a form of technology can futher those skills, then this can be a very good topic of disscusstion. In conclusion i would like to see a new and improved form of technology that will help teachers and staff get the knowledge to kids and young adults in need for a better life than say not having the new and impoved technological advances we have as a society now.

634848B2D08C,"I think this techonology that reads the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it could help others understand someones feeling.

These expressions are coming from the muscles in your body especially your face if you are using a lot of expression. ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crows's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This shows me ways you an figure out someones face expressions if they are serious or not. And it helps you out if they need any help. You could also tell by their muscles if you want to believe them or are they lieing just to get people to like them.

This technology could also be helpful because it could tell in school if you actually get it or you don't. ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The same techonology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-- for video games or video surgery."" This makes more sense why this techonolgy also could be helpful. This helps students more help and effort on their school works by using this techonology to notify a teacher because a lot of students doesn't want the whole class to know that they don't understand something.

This expression technology could help us understand our family or friends around us. ""Humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by thr look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually secribing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" This shows me that this techonolgy can help you around your family or friends because they might be feeling a negative way and you should uderstand that by suing this techonology so you can understand more and make them feel better; same as if they are feeling positive you might need to continue having that positive vibe and you know that by using this techonology.

I agree with this technology because it shows someones feelings by telling through their muscles. You can tell if they need help or they aren't feeling good you can tell through a technology and you could help them out.

Using a software can read someones emotional expression of a student in a classroom. You could also look at someone and maybe guess how they are feeling. You dont always need a software to figure out how someone is feeling. And you can tell how someone is feeling by the feedback that they give you. At least according to some new computer software you can recognize emotions. The software is the least innovation. The process begins when the computer constucts a 3-D computer model of the face all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. In fact, we humans perfoorm this same impressive ''calculation'' everyday. It could be hard to figure out someones facil expression but using thast software could help you figure out what they are feeling.

Many students are not happy with spending the day in school.

Teachers all over the country are collaborating to find things that intrest students.

Technology is hitting almost every school currently and it is bring kids to school more eager to learn.

Now, there is a computer software system created by Thomas Huang and Nicu Sebe that can detect someones emotions.

This program detects a persons emotions by looking at how the muscles work.

An example of this progam is when the author describes Mona Lisa and says ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"".

Technology should be used to read the emotional expressions of students during class becasue it will help teachers find ways to make education exciting for students.

Although sometimes people can read someones emotions, it is not possible every time.

A student could act like they are enjoying school when they are really not.

in some cases, students may not be sad because they are at school but becasue something is happeing to them outside of school.

In paragraph eight, the author says ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes .

But in a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius.""

This is an example of how sometimes people can not read someones emotions.

Also, the program would allow a teacher to change his or her lesson plans due to how students enjoy the teaching style.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or board,

Dr Huang predicts.

Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.""

Many students do not use words to express how they feel about something so this is a way to find out if they enjoy the teaching style or not.

If schools are able to get technology that detects emotions, it will help with how they need to organize the day and how to make it more fun for students to learn.

D9682CF8AFBC,"In the article Making Mona Lisa Smile, the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) enables computers to identify human emotions. Because of the many uses of this innovative software, it is evident that FACS would be valuable technology to use with students in a classroom.

As we walk further into the world of more and more technology, a large majority of schools across the United States are beginning to use iPads, Chromebooks, and laptops for their everyday schooling. Textbooks are online, lesson videos are posted to Youtube, and practice games are played on apps. Students are relying more on technology than ever before. Because of this, FACS would be beneficial in the learning of students. For example, the passage states, '''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor, ''' (D'Alto, Paragraph 6). If technology could save teachers time from teaching material students already know, and if a computer could efficiently determine the needs of students, this generation of kids could excell in a much greater degree than it currently is.

Another great benefit of FACS is that it would be able to sort and filter material based on your emotions to previous content. The computer software is able to detect six different emotions in addition to being able to tell if your emotions are forced or truthful. Each muscle in your face helps to show your emotion. FACS can determine which muscles were used to make your expression and therefore differentiate between real and fake emotions (D'Alto, Paragraphs 7-8). In the classroom, teachers spend hours preparing lesson plans which sometimes include videos and games. If FACS could determine the teachers emotions to the different videos and games, it could sort additional videos and quickly find content that the teacher likes and can use for his or her class. This can clearly be done because the author states, ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different,"" (D'Alto, Paragraph 6).

In addition, FACS could detect the emotions of students after watching lesson videos or playing class games to show their reactions to the content or even to show if they understand the material or are confused.

Now is a time where technology is growing and taking over places such as schools. It is important that teachers and students are provided with the best possible ways to teach and learn in order to ensure that the next generation of doctors, engineers, and CEOs is ready for whatever comes its way. Facial Action Coding System is clearly a piece of technology that will change the way classrooms work and will benefit students and teachers alike in the goal to train kids for generations to come. It helps teachers save time spent teaching material kids already know as well as sorting out content based merely on the emotions of the face. Finally, it provides a way for teachers to recognize confused students in an attempt to create the most efficient classrooms in which students can learn.

CFC85AA6EB00,"The creation of the Facial Action Coding System has the potential to be very innovative and useful in today's society. In schools, teachers often have difficulty obtaining the attention of students and maintaining it when they have it. This could be a result of the way they are teaching, and how it makes the students feel. The use of FACS in all classrooms would be found valuable.

Problems such as obtaining attention could easily be solved with the use of the FACS. If students are placed in a classroom, and are unhappy and bored, they are less likely to pay attention and learn at the rate they are capable of. The FACS can record these students' emotions and help change the method of teaching used in that class to interest the students. As stated in the passage by Dr. Huang, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This could potentially change the students attitude towards learning for the better.

A teacher is capable of understanding verbal communication better than that which is nonverbal. Unless a student tells their teacher he or she is confused or bored, the teacher has little to no way of knowing this. Dr. Huang states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" The FACS is able to detect such forms of emotion, and make corrections based upon them. This process makes the FACS more capable of dealing with these situations than any teacher.

Emotion is displayed often through facial expressions. Certain muscles in your face respond to specific emotions you are feeling at the time. It is not uncommon for a student to put on a fake smille or expression of understanding towards a teacher when he or she is bored and could care less. A teacher may have some difficulty understanding if the student's emotions are real or fake. Luckily the FACS recieves data from the recognition of movement in muscle tissues. The FACS is programmed to recognize which muscles move during each emotion. To provide an example the author explains, ""But in false smiles, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" SInce a different muscle is used in fake smiling than in that which is real, the FACS can tell the difference between the two expressions with ease.

The facts about FACS suggest that it is a perfect candidate for the use of innovative technology in the classroom. This system can improve the learning rates, as well as the mental growth of the students in a classroom. FACS can easily be proven valuable in all classrooms, as well as in many other environments among modern society.

Happiness comes from love, yes many can tell when their friend is upset that´s because they are close to them and know how they act. But just because you think you know how someone feels doesn´t mean you really know.

If you have a disease or some type of physical trait many don´t have then you may look different then others. Every human is different in many ways.

If you have downs syndrom you look happy all the time but that doesn´t mean you are.

A computer can not tell your emotions because a computer does not have emotions. just because your facial muscle structure is a certain way can not determin your mood.

I agree with this technology only because of how they are planning on using this for students. They are planning on making a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. They said that this computer would be like if the computer knew you're emotions on each ad. For example if there was an ad that appeared on you're screen that you didn't like then the next ad would be on a whole different topic. But if an ad that you did like came up on you're screen then the computer will know wheather to have a similar ad appear next. They are also saying that this technology on a computer could know when a student is confused or bored, then it could modify the lessons, like a human instructor. The part where I don't agree with this new technology is where the technology its self would let other people know exactly what you are thinking and how you are feeling. I feel like this would interfear with others privacy. For example, if some one was really happy because something good was going to happen to them or to someone else then if others knew they where so happy for this then they would most likely be asking them and that person might want to keep it as a secret. This also goes for if someone is not feeling good or is really just sad about something but didn't want to talk about it because it was vary personal to them then if others where to use this technology on them then that would interfear with that persons privacy.

Imagine a computer can tell how you're feeling just from your face, like for example you go to a computer and ask her how am I feeling today, then the computer will say= 83%happy, 9%disgusted, 6%fearful, 2%angry; And you'll be like WHAT?, how can a simple computer make such a thing?.

The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face, with 44 major muscles this is called ""action unit"".

Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System)

BODY: Dr. Huang observes that the facial expressions for each emotion are universal and humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" every day; How?: you can probably tell how is your friend feeling just looking at him or hearing his voice.

This software could change the whole world; For example imagine you are in the ethernet and then a web ad player pop's up, if you smile at it a similar ad might follow; But if you frown, the next ad will be different.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huang predicts.

CONCLUSION: Moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also can help produce them; we unconsciously imitate person's facial expressions. So in conclusion I would say that we can start using this magnificient software and his technology to read student's emotional expressions because it could also help teacher's to see how their student's are doing and if someone is distracted or bored the computer will notice the teacher so he/she can move on into another thing or go talk with the student.

Or if the students were not into the lesson the teachers was teaching and the teachers could try to change the lesson up a bit. It could also be helpful because if the student was sad the teacher would know and could try to help the student out in some kind of way. Or say like if the student was mad and the teacher didnt know the student could lash out of them and that would be bad but with the 3d computer the teacher could find out and could stay out of their way or try to help. Or say there was a bully in the class and the teacher didnt know and they had just made a new seating chart and they put the bully right by one of their victims and the student was scared you could use the 3d computer and check the student and see that he or she is scared you can solve the promblem right there and wouldnt have to worry about in the future. For example say if the teacher had a special day and she wanted to bring the students a treat so she baked some cookies and she brought the cookies to the students when their eating them she could check to see if they are happy and surprise that she brought them some cookies. Or if some of the students showed no the emotion to the teacher bringing them the 3d computer could tell them that. Say for example the students in the class took a test and normally everbody is feeling mad and bored but when they take this test all of them get a B+ or higher you could check the 3d computer and see they were all comfadent and ready for this test. In conclusion the 3d computer would be a good to use in a classroom and something teachers need.,2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
DA486689B3EF,"The use of this technology to read students emotional expressions is not very valuble. No one can read emotions like teachers and peers can. If a student is confused or needs help they can simply ask for it, theres no need for a computer to tell what they need help with.

When some people are working on assignments on they often use trial and error and sometimes they just need to think about the problem before they do it. This could get confusing for the computer because when your thinking you often will look confused or you might be confused but later figure it out. You shouldnt have to rely on a computer to tell how your feeling to get help. Dr. Huang said ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, Like an effective human instructor."" This ay sound like a good idea but if a student is getting bored they dont need there lesson modified to help them and most kids are going to be bored during school thats just how the majority of students are.

One thing that would be extremly hard to control would be when kids make weird or strange faces. How will a computer distinguish between an emotion due to the lesson and emotion due to something else. Like when a student is talkling to there friend and they laugh or smile. A student could also try to look bored or confused on purpose just to get out of doing certain work. Another big issue is the fact that not every students facial features are the same. One students face could look way different from the faces that the software the computer was built to recognize.

The last reason as to why this wont be a very popular tool in classrooms is because most school computers dont have cameras and wont be able to afford them or the software needed to run the programe. Of course they could get special fuding for the equipment but theres way better things that money could go towards to help the students excel in more ways then on a computer.

Its a very interesting idea but theres just way to many issues involved with it that wont allow it to takwe off like they invision. Its also just not anything that holds much value to schools If a student needs help they ask a computer cant tell what student needs better than a teacher can. It could be used for private use or maybe for something else but not in the education field.    ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
65058AFDF42F,"It would be a cool thing to have for something to read your facial expressions. But i don't think it will work very well because what happens if someone doesn't show much facial expressions. You just can't go by what their facial expression is. What if someone is having a bad day but is showing no facial expression about it.

The facial expression machine would be fun to have until we need something more new that can read facial expressions and nonfacial expressions. The reason we need something more new i becuase the fact that the machine can get it wrong if the person isn't showing a facial expression. Like you can't just tell by that becuase they can go wrong. The person may not show emotions that much so they can hide it really well. Also people don't really like to tell people how they are feeling.

So if they did have a machine that can read facial expressions but can't read emotions that they are hiding isn't a very good machine. They just need to build a machine that can do both. All because someone can be something else then what the machine picks up. So they need something that can do both so it can be right. All because of the reason someone don't show a whole lot of emotions. Plus the person can be lying to the machine and the machine picks up that you are happy but really you are not.

I think it would be good to hvae them in classrooms. Teachers should have them so they can read studets emotions. Here are my three reasons why teachers hsould have technology to read emotional expressions.

If the students like the teacher or any other students. If the teacher uses the technology on the students she can tell rather or not if the students likes her. If the students dont like the teacher can at least try to make that student like her. The teacher can tell if the student is going to give the teacher a bdad time by the teacher emotions.

I mean thats good to know because the teacher can know what student going to give her a bad time.

The students are in a bad mood or something or they getting bullied by a classmate. The teacher can know by using that technology on the student. If the student is in a bad mood the teacher can sit down with that students and talk to what student bully him. I think the teacher would find out more which students would catch the bullys. I think that technology would be grate for a school.

I think it could help the teachers know if the students would get that material. Like if they dont get it the teacher can use that technology and know if that student dont get. The teachers would ask that student if the students lie the teacher can use the technology. I think that would be great the teacher can help the student more.

It can show how people really feel and waht types of emotions they have at that time. This can aslo help people when they are drawing pictures to see what moods they have in their pictures .Yes I think that this well be helpful this can help people in the further when they are making pictures and they want the picture to have a certain mood.

One good example that they use in the storie would have to be when they tell about the that the ""Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy , 9 perecent disgusted , 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" I think that can come to good use like how do they know all of this form one picture. An how can this one 3-D computer do all of this on a picture . How can the computer tell the model of your face and how can they tell all 44 major muscles in in your body . They also tell how you can do is your self by looking in the mirror . An thy give you you the steps to try it out youself and what you need to do. I think that this computer is going to be good use for people thta studie pictures for a living it can tell them thing that they would not be able to see with there eyes. The storie tells about the muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus and what it dose to the picture . An you cant do this on your computer at home and that it wont be able to handle it .An your facial muscles not only expresses emotions.

In conclusion I think that this would be good to have in a class room setting. I thin that this would rely help people that want study this kind of thing in collage . An it would be as geat idea to put it in schools so that they can start when they are in school and it can help them if thats what they want to do they get done with school.

The author explained it in the story where he is telling the readers the instrustions in paragraph 9. Also it would awesome if we would be able to detect excactly how people are feeling even though they are showing something they really dont feel because that way we know if someone needs a laugh we could help or if someone is feeling grumpy we would know to not even bother that human.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2

From this article we can see how this new technology finds emotion through a face as well as how that information looks once it's calculated. From this passage I feel that this technology is very useful and could help alot of people.

One of the many uses for this technology is that it has the ability to help others when they are bored or confused in a classroom. This technology can modify the lesson in order for the student to better convey the information needed. This helps students get a better understanding of the material while still learning in a way that fits that students prefrences. If this were to be in schools today I feel that it would help thoughs who may be failing not because they want to but because they aren't understanding the material.

This technology can also help adults as well wheather it would be for advertising ,for video game companies,or for video surgery. When it comes to advertising this technology can recognize the enjoyment or displeasure you may get out of an advertisment. Say you like it and smile, the computer may regognize this and continue to provide you with similar ads that fit what you like. As for the last two being about video games and video surgery these two can construct faces in a more exprssive way than it would without this technology.

This article shows just how useful this technology is and represents just how far technology has come since. This is an important resource that could help many with alot of things. As well as help teach those who are confused. And even to better advertise a product to someone. And for these reasons I feel that this technology is valuable.

CEF6DE090E2B,"Have you ever looked at someone and thought, I wish I knew how they feel? Well now with the help of a new technology called Facial Action Coding System you can do just that. An article called ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" goes in depth about how the system works and what it does for society. Basically, this system shows you exactly what a face is feeling emotionally. I think this is a great idea and a step into the technology of the future.

One reason why this system is great is it can show you exactly what emotions someone has. The system constructs a 3-D model of the face on the computer. It then compares the face to a face that is showing no emotion. The system then looks at your 44 muscles in your face to see how you are feeling. The system can even detect mixed emotions. Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois is the creator of this system and he says this about the system, ""By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutral face."" Dr. Huang is explaining that this system can even detect if you are feeling multiple emotions by weighing different units.

Another thing the Facial Action Coding System can do is recognize faces from paintings. The most recent piece of art they have studied for emotions was the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. After the process, they discovered that the Mona Lisa is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. Gettng these results can now tell us what painters from a long time ago were thinking about in there art when they painted it. This can be very useful in figuring out more ideas from artists in the rennisance age.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is a great tool that can help out the future of emotions greatly. It can detect all emotions and even detect if someon had mixed emotions. It can also detect emotions in paintings like the Mona Lisa. I think this is a good idea and that it should be spread to the entire world.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
95570A90AED0,"Do you ever wish you could just look at someone and be able to tell how they are feeling? At the Beckman Istitute for advanced Science at the University of Illinois, Prof. Thomas Huang and his colleague are created just that. they call it ""Facial Action Coding System"". This system could be put into computers to keep track of your emotions. Maybe even by tracking your emotions, you could be happier.

The process works by using a 3-D computer of your face; all 44 major muscles. Than is the Facial Action Coding System associates the six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and saddnesswith each movement of the facial muscles.

Most human communication is nonverbal, even through we may not relize it, we always show our emotions. The facial expression for each emotion are unviersal. Using the Facial Action Coding System, it can track humans emotion or even a painting such as the Mona Lisa.

As humans we are always feeling something, weather its anger, saddness, or happiness. I think it would be of great value to have this technology at school, and put into our computers. Not all kids can learn the same way, which means kids can not be teached in the same way. If the student is working on the computer and they do not understand the lesson. The computer could change the lesson to teach it a differnt way.

All in all, I think this kind of technology could be very useful, not only in school but for psychologist and other who study the human body. Our emotions say alot about us amd if that is how most of us communicate; we should know more about them.

This showes the readers that really anyone can change there emotions and make you think they feel this way because we have the ability to change just how we feel, we have self control over it. people can creat a facial expression like how they do in acting when they computure reads your face.

1E39E44DB9BF,"Wouldn't it be nice if we could know the percentage of each emotion a person is feeling? With this new software called the Facial Action Coding System, that is now extremely possible. The use of this techonology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classrom is indeed valuable because it can help sutdents express empathy, help them improve in class, and overall help teachers understand emotions when they cannot fully reognize them.

There have been a plethora of conversations regarding empathy and how important it is, and the Facial Action Coding System causes empathy when we can clearly see what emotion a person is feeling. According to the article, ""empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions"", so with this new techonology, we can improve the way we read other's emotions, and this can trigger a sense of emapthy within us to know exactly what emotion they are feeling. For students in a classroom this is beneficial because a teacher can understand the ranges of emotion their student is feeling, as well as help the students recognize the emotions of their fellow classmates. With this innovative technology, empathy could be something far easier to produce.

Along with producing empathy, the Facial Action Coding System can even aid students in ther performance in the classroom, because according to Dr. Huang, the technology can ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and this helps because ""it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" which can immensely help the student to become more engaged because the lesson becomes more interesting. Dr. Huang also notes that ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"", and this is significant because a student may not voluntarily express that they are disinterested in a lesson, but the computer could recognize that anyways, and it is important for it to read the nonverbal communication the student reveals. Therefore, techonology can rapidly increase the performance of students by reading their emotions and engaging them into the lesson.

As well as improving the performance of students, this technology can improve the relationship between a teacher and student, becuase it benefits the teacher to know a student's emotion when they cannot fully recognize them. As an example, the article states, ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"" although, ""most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."", which shows that us humans have trouble actually matching a facial expression to an emotion. Although, with the Facial Action Coding System, this ""computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code"", which is significant because this code works to portray specific emotions. so we humans can better understand them. Therefore, in a classroom setting, this is important because with the technology, it allows teachers to be aware of what their student is feeling, creating a stronger student-teacher relationship.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System would build a better relationship between students and teachers in a classroom setting, help students improve in the class, and produce empathy with both students and teachers. Nonverbal and emotional communication is incredibly important in human interaction, so this technology can help explain emotional responses, ""even when they are trying to hide their emotions"". A software that ""improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others"" could potentially be greatly beneficial to students in a classroom, because of its complex ability to help humans express emotion better, which also helps the communication between computer and human.

In the begiining of the article it talks about how the new software can detect emotions of others. At first it sounded weird to have your face scanned to see what your emition is. But it later makes sense later on why you should have face scanned to see your emtotion.

Later in the article it talks about how the facial reconition can help you through out your life. For example paragraph 6 sentence 4 for says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could moditfy the lesson ,like an effective human instructor."" So when I read that it makes more sense to do that becuse not all teachers will not know if a student will understand a question or lesson. Or some students are scared to say they dont understand a question or lesson because they might be scared to speak up. But with a facial scanner no student will not need to be scared to ask if they don't understand a question. Plus not all student's learn the same way, so if a student doesn't understand something becuase the way its being taught the Facial Action Code System can scan their face and find another way to help slove the problem.

In conclusion I find Facial Action Coding System as a postive impact for students. Its the latest tech so its not an old system. The scanner can tell if a student doesn't understand a problem.

It will indicate actions, emotions and feelings so that could help our friends if they are wondering why we are in a happy mood or a bad mood.

Our friends are really helpful at times so if our friend is feeling down or is happy about something we should have the right to know. According to Dr. Huang the software can tell us many things about a persons mood or what they are really feeling like. Knowing if a person is down or happy we can talk to them and ask what is going on, why are you sad or why are you so happy. By the computer telling us how a person is feeling will be so valubale because it shows us how big our technology is getting and by us knowing that we know there is going to something bigger than that later on in the future so now all we would do is wait for something bigger.

This software would be very helpful fot our own teachers because they could take us to the computer get our face to the computer and indicate if we aare bored or not. If she does this while she is teaching lesson and finds out we are confused then she can change her ways in teaching that lesson so we can actually understand it and if the teacher knows we are in a happy mood then she knows we understand the material or atleast thats why we are happy.

The Facial Acting Coding System would be a really good thing for us so we ned to get it attachted to our school software. All together it would help our friends and teachers.

In the passage it talks about how the computer calculates your emotions and show what type of emotions you are having. In the paragraphs it talks about people and what there emotions are just by looking at a computer. I honestly don't think this type of thing is valuable to the students at all.

The reason i think it's not valuable is because what do you need to know how people is feeling or not before? If it really was a problem with them they would come up and tell the teacher what's wrong with them. Like for example you can be smiling all day in still not be happy about something. So if it just goes off your facial expressions than i don't think it is valuable. On the other hand if it can see what you really are thinking than maybe it is a little valuable to the students and teahcers at school. So it really depends on how the technology works to really know if it's valuable or not.

In paragragh 3 it tells you all the type of emotions it regonizes .Like for example it say ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle(above your eyes)raised your eyebrows when you're surprised.""This tells us that just off of face expressions it can tell how you feel. My point is though is what if you have a face expression on your face but that is really not how you are feeling, is the computer going to know that or not because if they don't once again i don't think it's going to be that valuable to people.

In paragraph 4 it states that"" the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,""observes Dr. Huang,""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression""What he was meaning by that is that there are a lot of face expressions you can make & you might look at it one way but the other person might look at it differently than you sometimes. In paragraph 5 it says ""For instance,you can probably tell how your friend or a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course,most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried, ect.""Meaning a frend of yours can have one faical expression on there face but be feeling total different inside.

902A59ECB525,"I think the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) can prove how a person is feeling due to having a 3-D computer model, an electronic code, and a facial software.

First, the FACS has a 3-D computer model to help it figure out a persons emotion. In the text it says, ""all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a humans muscles."" This evidence shows that a humans facial muscles shows how a person is feeling and each emotion has their own charateristics.

Second, the FACS also has an electronic code which helps the system understand better the emotion just kanda how us as humans can tell if our friend is upset or happy. For example in the text it says, ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" This evidence shows that the software has the same kind of thing that lets us humans know how our friend is feeling.

Lastly, the facial software helps FACS by using human features on the face understand the emotions. In the article it says, ""muscles called orbicularis oculi palpabraeus makes crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This evidence shows that even a computer software can tell what you're feeling by your face features.

So what I think is that they will have access to our camera and they could see our face and how we feel and that is weired.

79C4A541FCDC,"I am absolutely for the new tchnology called Facial Action Coding System. Because this technology can be valuable in more than one way. According to the passage this technology can detect when a student is growing bored and can make the subject more interesting. If that was available for students then learning subjects would be come more memorable, because usually when a student becomes bored he or she tends to ""drift of into space"" and not learn anything that is being taught.

If you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, then a similar ad would follow and if you frown then the next ad would be different. That technology could make shopping a lot more effecient, more buying what you do like and less of what you do not like. People around the world would be able to get alot more things done and could possibly become smarter. The technology would break down subjects and materials to help you understand things better like an actual human would.

In conclusion technology this advanced would not only expand the growth of your brain but potentionally expand the growth as a country and in wealth.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
449217B9C0F5,"The use of this technololgy towards students in a classroom, I think it is a good idea. If teachers found out how we feel or our face expressions to show them how we are feeling that day. I feel like it's a great idea, that way teachers and staff know if they are having a bad day or are in need of help. Some students in school can be stressed even over homework in the classroom or at home. Reading students facial expression and there feelings is good for the students and teachers, because the teachers can help there students and they can be happy.

In paragraph 6, it quotes ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" If the computer can figure out the students feelings and emotions, I most certainly think it's a good idea to have the Facial Action Coding System. This system can help every student there is in a classroom by having teachers make them happy or help them with something that they are having trouble with. Some students can be very sad and upset that this system can save someone's life. Usually you can notice someone's not having a good day or is having a good day by looking at there face. No one can find out if they are really sad inside with a small smile on there face, nobody can find out if something happened to them and they're hiding it. But with that system, teachers would be able to find out what is wrong with there students.

In paragraph 4, it quotes ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face."" When it comes down to the Facial Action Coding System, that would find out whether or not the students face expression is being sad, angry, happy and etc. No matter what the students face expression is or looks like. I feel as if this system would be greatly used in school's. It can save kids lives and help each and every one in the school and classroom's. ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human motions. How people are feeling even when they are trying to hide their motions. In the smile of Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. Felt the experince of ""The Mona Lisa demostration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"".

People are feeling even when they are trying to hide their motions because in a new technology can describe the human motions. They know that the painting of Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy 9 percent disgusted they calculate the facial expressions for each emotion universal. The motions of any students in a clasroom computer are confused or bored. In the painting many know the feeling motions of her smile but have 83 percent happy in her smile.

In the painting of Mona Lisa is 6 percent fearfun and 2 percent angry. This is painting to recorgnize for many people in all the world, because is an painting of Leonardo da Vinci's. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games to learn more about the motions of people. An example of the text is ""Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of Da Vanci Code"".

The theory of motion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. The Mona Lisa demostration expression is really intended to bring a smile to your face. The new motion-recognition sofware tracks these facial basic motions are happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, and disgust. The facial emotions for universal to many students want to investige the painting of Mona Lisa. Many use the same techonology for conclude the different motions of the painting. The students can talk about the experince of the Mona Lisa demostration of her emotions about a painting very good.

In conclusion the author describes a new technology called ""The Facial Action Coding System"". Because the technology help to know the emotional expressions to students. The painting of Mona Lisa is very famous in the world however many students can use the new technology to learn more about the human motion.

F0BF1449FA2E,"Many people struggle with reading peoples emotions. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile "" by Nick D' Alto writes that the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for students in classrooms. While many may agrue that the Facial Action Coding System are not valuable, In fact it is. For example, being able to detect how other people are feeling, develope better ways for humans and computers to communicate, and lastly the computers could modify the lessons based on the how the students are feeling.

First, the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for detecting how people are feeling. Alto writes, "" Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions. New software has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others"" . This quote shows that when a person is confused on what the other person is feeling , this machine will help someone know exactly how the other peron is feeling.

Second, the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. Alto writes,"" Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to communicate"". This quote shows that this machine is not only detecting facial emotions but it is a great way for humans to comunicate with computers.

Thirdly, the Facial Action Coding System is valuable for Modifying the lessons based on how students are feeling. Alto writes,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson"" . This quote shows that the computer could pick up if one of sudents is getting confused , bored ,etc. and it could modify the lesson so that the student will not be confused or bored anymore.

The Facial Action Coding system is valuable to have in a classroom , Although many say its not, These three reasons is why having the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a class room. In the world today many people struggle knowing what someone is feeling so they know wheather to help them or not so this machine could really help someone in the future.

97249F8DF48F,"Technology is always improving. From a simple toaster to a toaster that can make several pieces at once. This facial recognition is a new way of detecting the true emotions of someone. I think the use of this technology is useful to all students, parents, governement workers, and etc.

Facial expression does not have a set of rules you have to follow. For example, when someone is very angry, they might cry instead. In result, the computer might take it as sadness. Most of the time, facial expressions are easy to recognize. In paragraph 2 of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" it says, ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face"" (D'Alto 2). Everyone has different neutral faces. Most people have a good way of keeping in their emotions, making their face look blank.

When expressing emotions, certain muscles are tied to certain emotions. In paragraph 3 of the article, the author says, ""... your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes raises your eyebrows when you're surpised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"" (3). Most of the time when you are surprised, you raise your brows. Also, when you are mad, you make a face, and tighten your lips.

When in school, you can use your facial expressions to show how you are feeling. In paragraph 6, the author goes on to explain that, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huange predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Several teens do not speak up when they do not understand something that was taught during class because they do not want to be embarrassed. So if you are at home, on a computer, you will not have to speak up you can just act the same, and the computer will change it to help you understand more efficiantly.

In conclusion, facial recognition is a great way to get students on the right track in school. It can help the teachers decide if their teacher techniques are effective or not. Also, facial recognition can help people understand how others are feeling in certain pictures. If someone throws on a fake smile for a photo, the computer will recognize that. Many different emotions, have different ways it can be shown. The computers detect multiple emotions including: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness (3).

F8CD685F9B8C,"Everyone has their good times and their bad showing many mixed emotions. People will show emotions, and sometimes they wont. There are so many emotions; bored, happy, sad, angry, confused, scared, and your telling me that this ""Facial Action Coding System"" can detect them all? Putting ""technology to read the emotional expressions of a student"" is a big NO. Even at times we don't know how we feel, how can a computer tell us what we feel.

These computers being able to identify human emotions is scary if you think about it. Over the pass ten years the interenet has become a real popular thing. People use it to socialize and play game, but what happens when someone loses in a game or doesnt agree with what someone else is saying. We have a reaction thats not exspected. People can be very agressive verbaly through the interent. Because of the interent there have been more suisides now then there has ever been. Knowing how you feel could increase the risk of suside and/or thoughts of suiside considering over half of the worlds population has depression. (which can lead to suiside)

Even if this ""Facial Action Coding System"" can detect our feelings what actions are going to be taken. Even though ""Alto"" did say ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

They didn't give any imformation on how they are going to do that. It sounds like when they say ""like an effective human instuctor"" they are refering to a robot which has no expresion in its voice. That would make someone not pay attention even more the voice would be very boring causing the student to doze off even more.

Sometimes Schools are more poor then other and have no way of paying for computers. This softwear ""Facial Action Coding System"" could cost money they never adressed cost in the article. This would also be something that the teacher and students would have to adapt to as well. Where just now getting laptops and Ipads into schools to ""better push education."" I read a study over E-Learning vs Paper. They took a group of students of the same grade level, and split them into two groups. Gave them both the same exact passage with the same exact questions, but one was all on the computer while the other one is on paper. When the results came back from both groups more kids on paper did better. Not only do kids learn better using paper we save money from having to buy computers that may have been broken or damaged.

People need to experince all of these different kinds of emotions to be able to handle these experinces. Without these experinces when something where to happen we wouldnt be able to handle it. If we continue with using ""Facial Action Coding System""

Suiside rates could go up. Using this in classroom could also make students get less infomration by not being able to focus on what's being tought to them.

Not everyone lives in the riches places would this program be able to be funded to schools or pay through the goverment.

This is somthing that we should not go on forward with because doing so may make us suffer the effects of the future causing the people of our future to be looked down upon.      ",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8

When we at med time to see that could be a angry photo and so on. We can not actually know what is the real expression from this painting.

One reason is''Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists,such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System).Eckman has classified six bisic emotions--happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness--and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.''There have six bisic emotions on computer can help us to recognize the subtle facial movements. Another reason is ''A classroom computer recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'' Dr. Huang predicts. So that evidenced computer can recognize the emotional expressions of the students in the classroom is valuable.

5F897C00DB43,"The idea of using facial recognition technology to identify how someone is feeling is a new one. It is also a preposturous one. You cannot fully understand what someone is feeling by looking at their face, and attempting to do so is an invasion of their privacy. Facial action coding systems should not be used in classrooms.

The idea that you could fully decipher what someone is feeling based on how they look is absurd. You cannot decide for yourself how someone feels based on the movement of their muscles. For example, if someone looks sad, you cannot just decide that they are sad, just because they look that way. If a machine decides I look confused, does it really have the right to change what I am learning? To understand how someone is really feeling, you have to first ask yourself why they might be feeling that way. Once you understand this, then you can determine what is happening. A machine cannot read minds. If I am confused about one thing, the machine does not know what. Not to mention that people often feel varying emotions at varying times of the day. I might be sad one minute, then laugh at a joke the next. I might not understand something, than understand it in the next second. The machine might automatically change something I understood based on a few seconds of confusion. This is not efficient or helpful.

To read someone's emotions based on their facial expressions is an invasion of their privacy. Let's assume this machine can accurately decipher someone's emotions based on muscle movement. What if you don't want people to know how you're feeling? If I am confused about something, and I am embarrased about it, suddenly the whole word knows. It should be up to the student to decide whether or not they want to seek help, not some magical machine. By forcing students to share private emotions, you run the risk of making them less willing to go to school. Who would want to go to a school where everyone knows how you feel at all times of the day? That would affect learning severely, and would definitely do more harm than good. Hindering learning in an attempt to better understand students is not worth it.

Using this software in classrooms would be ineffective, and even if it did work, it would be a huge invasion of privacy. This software should be used on paintings and nothing more. It is not accurate enough to do anything other than hold back human learning. This software is not fit for classrooms. ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

016A5550CAF7,"Throughout the article author, Nick D'Alto, meets Dr. Huang who has created a way to recognize someones real emotions through technonlgy and a computer system that could help people read emotions of students in a class room. The new software that has been developed and is being used on humans is the Facial Action Coding System. The first subject was the Mona Lisa painting, to us it is just a portrait with a woman in it smiling, but to Dr. Huang he uses a coding system to find out that she was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2% angry (D'Alto 1). This was all figured out by a computer, now imagine being able to read a whole class room full of students real emotions with just one click of a button.

If teachers and other students knew how a whole class room of students were actually feeling deep down inside everyone could probably end up having a good day everyday. Most people like to keep their emotions privite, because living in this world today anyone can put a smile on their face and pretend they are okay. Not everyone is really ever always okay. Which us humans are aware of because we can tell how someone is feeling just by the looks on their face. Yet humans are not experts so to us, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" (D'Alto 4). No one ever truly knows how one another is feeling, but this Facial coding system can help fix that. Evidence states in paragraph 8, ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celbrity isn't being truthful."" With this new technology humans can physically no longer lie about how they are feeling. While joining this experiment it is said by, ""the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them."" So if a class room of students just joined this experiment it could actually make them much more happier.

Concluding, that this tecnological emotional experiment being used on a classroom full of students could help everyone have a good day every day. Everwhere around the world humans can put a smile on their face and predend they are okay, but with this new coding system it could truly help prevent that. If a student in the class room was pretending to be okay, and then stood infront of the computure to be coded it would pick up the real emotions on the face just by obseving a mouth being streached sideways using the zygomatic major and risorius revealing the student isn't actually happy. With the help of Science and Dr. Huang it could reveal so much more about the real emotions in someone elses life that no one ever knew about. ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

EB7944FDAF63,"Technology has been used for decades in education, from the basic computer to smart boards technology has been commonly used to improve the learning capabilities of students in modern times. The 'Facial Action Coding System'

technology has the ability to help professors and teachers around the world get more into the minds of their students and engage the students into a classroom where learning is not a unified thing, but more customized and free depending on student ability.

Firstly, with technology becomming more popular, an increasing number students are having the ability to learn through technology. Along with that teachers and professors around the world have had to adapt to the higher usage of technology and programs to teach their students. This program gives teachers and technology the ability to adapt to their students, and encourage even confused or fearful students to learn by engaging a learning environment where a student's computer or device could read and recognize the confusion or joy a student is undergoing while learning,and therefor helping the teacher know the students level of understanding.

Secondly, having a program installed into the lense of cameras in students devices would open up new insight to teachers. For example, if a student watches a video lesson in a History class and is confused by something then their teacher could find the question, or peice of video, and simply adjust the lesson to fit the demographic and understanding of that child. There are many benifits to this technology including in the home, if a parent were to have the ability to see where their child was confused or frusterated the parent could also take some time to cover the missing material. This also prevents students who are fustrated but are to fearful or anxious to ask for help to not recive the assistance they need. This technology could open up door ways for students instead of them being lost in the information, but this technology is still new. .

Finnaly, one of the main reasons students do poorly in the current education system is that the student feels like they are not reciveing enough help or that they are lost. With average class sizing being anywhere from 22-32 students, a single or even two teachesr cannot assist all of the students individualy, and this creates a problem. Using the 'Facial Action Coding System' teachers can register which students need help and those who dont and pay more attention to the students who need help. This would therefore increase the amount of students able to retain information and help the school. Being lost in a lesson wouldn't be so common of a problem.

In conclusion, the 'Facial Action Coding System' opens new advancments in the the education systems by encourgaing an environment where teachers could have the technology to know when a student was confused or not understanding information, and also giving the ability for teachers to construct a lesson to fit the children who don't directly understand. It also proves a good method for parents to get involved in their child's learning and help the student with direct problems at the root instead of complications with the entire subject. So yes, this technology is very vaulable to the education of millions of students around the world who don't fully grasp their teachers learning methods or are just confused.",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8
974FC194F049,"The world has become extremly evolved and is now able to create software that can read every single emotion on a person's face. It can be used in several different situations. From the text, the author talked about how it is used to read emotion in paintings and also read emotions of students. This emotion reading technology would be a good addition to the classroom because it could help to make sure kids are more engaged in the lessons.

Today, school can feel long and tiring. If we had emotion reading technology in schools, it would help to engage students more in the lessons. The author explained how if a student begins to show boredom during a lesson, it would be able to change it in a way to please the student. If that was added to schools, students would be able to focus more since the lesson is being tailored to that specific student. Not only will it recognize when a student is bored, but also confused. If a student gets confused during a lesson, the computer can help by reapeating that part of the lesson. In a normal classroom with a teacher, you would have to stay after class to be able to get more explanation of the lesson. In paragraph 6, Dr. Huang notes, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" What he means by this is that people don't express their emotions by telling them to others. We don't share how we feel. We simply try to express it on our faces. A teacher wouldn't tailor the lesson to each and every person's emotion based on their facial expression. It would be impossible to tailor the lesson to a classroom of 25 students and their needs. Each student in the classroom has a different mind set. Some are able to concentrate well and pass with straight As. Others are unable to concentrate and will only pass with a C. With this new technology, we would be able to tailor the lessons so that each student is able to pass with good grades.

The technology to read facial expressions of emotion would be helpful in the classroom to help students focus more and understand their school work more. If you stop paying attention for just a second, you'll be lost for the majority of the lesson.

Since some kids dont really tell you whats going on with their life, and you see them sad or crying but they wont tell you what they are feeling like. So I think you can use these. I think students will find very interesting these computer models, beacuse they have 3-D cumputer models that recognize their faces and get every little muscle of their face to make almost like a replica in order to see the facil expressions you make, like when the cumputer recognises your face it shows if you like something or not like the ads on your phone.

The main reason i believe this should be used in schools, is to see how the students reaction is the they way teachers are teaching them. Think about it. If most of the students are 80 percent bored, 10 percent happy, and 10 percent angry because they aren't learning in a way they should in schools then, it might be time for change. The teachers should expirement with this new age technology. As they try to change there teaching style, they can use the facial reconizion to see if most student like they way he or she is teaching. If this were to be in schools then, the studend could be more like Mona Lisa, 83 percent happy, 9 percent discusted 6 percent ferful and 2 percent angry.

Not only should the students have to use it, the teachers should have to use it as well. Some people might wonder "" Why would the teachers have to use it, they aren't the ones learning?"" Ill tell you why they should have to us this facial emotion dector. If the teachers are grumpy all the time or, if they aren't happy at there carrer, they need fired. Now tell me this. If the teachers are always mad and hate there job, how do you expect the students to learn if the teacher is mad all the time. They'll just throw a paper at them and tell them to work. With this new equipment, you can use it to see if a teacher is happy. You can see if the teacher can make the class fun so the students will be happy.

In conclusion, I believe that the emothion reader should be in schools. This should be used not only for the students but, for the teachers as well. If the teacher isnt happy the teacher is always mad, the kids will be unhappy and bored in class. The student won't get the quality education that they could've from the start.

No, that's not your science teacher,grading your latest lab assignment. Its the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotion."" The software can help teachers actually help students with mental health instead of writing them a slip and just saying you are fine. Also teachers can tell you how to coop with certain stresses bust by scaning you with a computer program. This can also help teachers find the student that caused trouble if they are not cooperating, because the program can tell if the subject is lying or not. This claim is supported by the following quote. "" To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clies are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" polictician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" The program can also help schools by seeing if a student is under a lot of pressure and needs help right away.

Some students may understand half of the assignment but not all of it & why re teach it all of it when the teacher could just help the student where the student left off. This is also very valuable because some students will say they get it but really don't so they won't look a certain type of way in front of their peers. This makes the teacher job a little bit easier & the a lot less stressful to the student, knowing the teacher knows he or she needs help without saying it out loud.

This would cause less students to fail & higher grades for sure because everyone in the classroom is getting the help that they need.

This Facial Action Coding System also is very valuable because, it lets the teacher know if the students don't even get it at all. A lot of students will not raise their hand for help, to not look like they don't get it while everyone else gets it. This Facial Action Coding System would benefit those type of kids that are shy to raise their hands in class for help. All together this would lead to much better grades for all the students for everyone in the class, it would help the teacher find new ways to explain the assignment using another method. Which is a plus for the students, this Facial Action Coding System works not only for students but for the teacher to.

One last reason i think the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable is because, it focous on the students that really need help. If one half of the class gets the assignment then the teacher doesn't need to keep going over it again if that side of the class already understand. This helps the teacher a lot becuase a teacher goal is to pass everyone in the class & by doing so help the students that need it the most. This would make school a lot less stressful.

This invention helps tell where the student is confused, if the student dosen't get any of it at all or if the student totally gets & doesn't need extra help. I think this invention is one of the best inventions we have ever came across. This invention takes so much pressure of students, they don't have to worry as much about not learning the assignment. This helps the teacher job a lot more easier the invention works hand & hand. This would for sure bring grades up if the student is willing to put in the work to learn the assignment that the teacher is teaching.         ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
DB4AA9C5B389,"I am against using the value of technology to read students' emotional expressions. I'm not saying that this type of technology is bad though it isn't good either. I feel like this type of technology has no purpose what so ever.

In paragraph five it states that ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by looking at their face."" If I could do that why do I need a computer to tell me that they are happy, sad and whatever else. Just by looking at the Mona Lisa painting you can tell that she is somewhat happy but also doesn't seem like she cares about being painted. Why do we need to calculate emotions to know just exactly how a person is feeling?

In conclusion we don't need this type of technology just to see what a person is feeling. It mostly feels like a waste of time at least to me. ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
16ED1E19CD0B,"Having this type of technology can help people understand others emotions in many ways. It is obvious that this type of technology can not only help others understand students emotions, but possibly help the students who are feeling a certain way. I think that using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is valuable.

Having technology that can help show how a person is truly feeling is hepful in so many ways. For example, helping a person out who is feeling sad. A student in the classom is normally good at hiding their true emotions or how they are really feeling, but with this technology, a teacher could possibly help this student out once finding out that the student was upset or bothered with something either inside or outside of the classroom. Another way this technology is valuable is by being able to notice when a student is flustered or angry about not understanding a certain part of what they are learning. Not only can this technology determine one emotion, but can determain mixed emotions. This could help a lot when a student in the classroom may not fully understand a topic they are learning but say they understand it completly.

Having the chance to use this technology can help students further understand the subject they are on, because the teacher for sure recognizes that the student may not understand it. This also means teachers have more of the oppertunity to help their students out mentally. The use of this technology in classroms is very valubale for many obvious reasons.

C295C3018962,"This system could be very benificial in classrooms for many reasons. One reason being this system can literally tell what all of your emotions are an what percent each of them are. How a student feel about school or a class can effect how they do in school or the class big time. If a student hates the class and dreads going there every single day then that will effect how they do in the class and usaully for the worse, this does not mean they will fail the class but alot of the time there grade will not be as good as it should be. If a student loves the class and loves going to school then obviously they will be more ingaged and do better in the class most of the time.

Schools could use this system to see what they could change in the school to make kids enjoy class and school more. Them doing this would hopefully improve grades and attitudes toward school which could always lead to more students wanting to go to college.

But not only it helps during class time it can also help outside of school like if the student's play sports the coches can know when the student is sad, tired, happy,or angry.

41553A472563,"In this article of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it talks about how a facial recognition software can detect your mood. It is brough up in paragraph six that this software should be introduced into classrooms. Classrooms are already getting technologically advanced and are gaining more expenses from this as well. Adding Facial Action Coding Systems to students' computers will just add unwanted price increases, pointless space takeup, and more complexity to computers in our classrooms.

Adding this Facial Action Coding System (FACS) will just add on to the expenses that schools are already putting into place just to add on to the technology that people are trying to push into schools. If a school of lower income tries pushing this system, taxes and school payments will be greatly increased on parents that might not even want this system at all. Although richer schools may be able to afford this software, it will definitely take money away from sections of the school that actually might need attention such as athletics or even music and art classes. Money saved from not buying a software that is just a want and not a need can fork money over to parts of schools that actually need the money. This software is not a necessity and if bought, can take away money from areas that need attention. Not only is the price not needed to be added to, but this software may not even help students in the classroom.

Students in schools with enough money to give students their own laptops usually have used a lot of money on these already expensive devices. Laptops in schools are most usually used to help students who are sick at home to stay connected to their teachers to get assignments. Other uses for the laptops range from eliminating paper and also researching. The FACS software just adds another layer of complexity to the laptops. In paragraph six, the author talks about how the software can see your reaction to ads on screens and adjust new ads to this facial expression. Not only can you be frowning for other reasons than your computer, but if you are doing schoolwork, why does it matter if you are mad or happy? Laptops are to get work done and get through school to help you research and understand topics more. Laptops are not for fun but are tools to help you succeed in school by helping you learn topics applied by the teachers. This software could be extremely helpful at home, but at school it just makes the laptops more complex than they need to be.

If a laptop is being used in school, it is being used as a tool to eliminate paper and help teachers connect to students on a higher level. These laptops are already complex enough to have several tabs at once, documents eliminating paper usage, and also have online textbooks. Some students who are not very educated in technology may see some information gathered and used by laptops to seem very confusing and maybe even frightening. Adding this FACS to laptops at schools will just change how students are seeing their laptops and can be switched around by students making faces at it. If a student is very sad and looks at the computer, it may make things happier and more colorful, but what happens when somebody is very happy? Will the computer turn dark and very bland to make them sad? The software will add another layer to these already complex devices that is not needed. The software may be a want in the eyes of people trying to make school more enjoyable, but this software is merely useless in connection to learning experience. Even with all of these negatives, there are some positives in that some genuinely sad individuals using this software can be cheered up and will actually begin to pay attention to their screens. This software has many negatives but at the same time might actually be used for good in schools that can afford it and still have money left over.

All in all, this software may be helpful to those outside of classrooms, but in reality it may be too expensive for some to implement into these already expensive devices. FACS at its worst will be a price increase, an unneeded software, and a system that will add complexity to these laptops. But, FACS at its best can greatly increase moods of poeple who have acquired this software in hopes of it increasing moods and helping students focus. This software should be relatively unexpensive which will give schools the ability to talk to families about implementing this software into laptops to help students learn. If a school can afford this software and it is approved by families, this definitely can help students focus unless this is too expensive for schools but is added anyways. To conclude, this software is somewhat useless in a way but it is completely up to the school corporation and the families of the school to decided if this should be implemented into our daily lives.

1134E5131492,"The technology use to read emotional expressions of students can be valuable. The reasons why i think this is because if you can calculate emotions you can see from all the emotions like, happiness, surprise, anger, digust ,fear and sadness. All of these have their own facial muscles. Like when your surprised your eyebrows rise which is your frontalis par lateralis muscle. Another reason why this might be valuable is people who have emotion problems. It can help doctors determine weather its a muscle that isn't working properly or some kind of nerve. It can be helpful to people who are depressed some people may have trouble showing their emotions. They can show a web ad and ifyou smile, a similar ad migh follow. Which that is very true. Some people aren't intrested in things as others are. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. This is also an amazing thing for the perfessors out there and teachers. Some students are shy and won't go up or raise there hand for help. I was like this all the way up to my sophmore year of highschool and that isn't very good. That's why some students are struggling at this very moment. Their confused, needing help but won't speak up. Knowing one or more of your students are confused will help you. People can tell by your expressions what and how you are feeling. By trying to see if someone is trustful look at how they smile. The mouth being stretched using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. Faces don't lie to you. It satisfying how when practicing or moving your facial muscles not only express emotions, but also may help produce them. Puttingna smile on your face will help you alway be happy and keep one on your face. It crazy how much you can learn by just reading something with so much science you never would have known. This computer device will help to determine what makes a person feel the way they feel which is a brilliant idea. Because not only is it useful for entertainment but also for serious problems or issues. I agree that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable.   ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
A143BE759AD2,"After reading this article, I have grown a nutreal side of this topic. The reason why is becuase I found a liking for the discovery, but there is also some things that I dislike as well. This tech can become useless and useful in many situations.

One reason why this is a good piece of technology is for court cases or things such as that. People could check if a persons emotions are set of fear, anger, sadness, and other emotions as well. If this technology becomes advaced we could see if a person is lieing just by their facial actions. This could help court cases become justified and more crimes solved.

A reason why this is bad is due to people and their privacy. I would like it to be scanned just to see my emotions, many people would agree with me on this as well. People who could get their hands on this could use it too much or go over the top with this tech. Also, since there is people who probobly don't like this type of technology, they would throw a fit it they would have to use it.

Also another reason why this is bad is the portablity of this technology. For this to work they would need a high end computer to check someone, and not everyone can just wheel in a computer like that and check someones emotions out of the labatory. This technology is usless without a lab becuase you need a lot of tech to do this expierment on someone.

Another reason why I partly side with this technology is for old painting, such as this article explains. The artcile talks about finding the emotions of one of the most world wide known paintings in the world, the Mona Lisa. We could find out people emotions from years ago, dating back from the first detailed paintings. This could also work on not just paintings, but old photos. Imagine seeing what emotions people had in pictures from World War 1 or other wars. Seeing this could bring a new sight into history.

One of my most favorite reasons why we need this is for classrooms. Many people get bored in school, so this computing could help out. The article claims that it could tell if a student is bored or confused, and could change the way the lesson is in seconds. This could help kids out with learing and could future their education. But with that computers would have to understand if a student is making a face to confuse the computer into thinking the kid is confused or not, because we all know that one student that would play with the computer to mess up peoples education for the day.

Another bad reason for this is becuase people could fake their emotions. Many people know how to act on stage, so they could easily do that to a computer to fake their emotions. This could trick computers to doing things that it really shouldn't. This means that this technology could become tricked, making it usless in many situations.

A good reason for this is for advertising. The article states that ads can be modifyed to show things that make you happy and could make you purchase it. If you see a ad you don't like you won't get ads like those anymore, insted it will supply ones that will possibly make you happy, if you still don't like those ads, the process will repeat will you do find a interesting ad. This could lead to higher sales, but also lower sales.

Lastly, my final reason is how hard it will be to access this tech. It states in the article that a home PC will not be able to handle to algorithims to understand facial emotions. Many people will not be able to expirement with this nor use it at all. So this technology will not be know to the public unlike other technology.

All in all, this technology will recive mixed opinions, manly due to the fact that people will not be able to get their hands on it unlike phones, laptops, PC's, and consoles. This item can be very useful, but needs to be polished to be absolutely useful in every situation. This technology will grow as long as they work hard enough to make this tech one-hundered percent useful in this world.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

Why do students need technology like this to tell the emotion of a painting? I think its a good idea but at the same time not because these students can use the techniology and try to photoshop a picture with this new technology or they can try to make they painting look alot differnet then what it needs to look like... I would know im a kid myself kids do these things all the time and get away with it, But at the same time thiss could get outta hand what if you cant tell the emotions of the picture or painitns then what? How would this new technology be used at school or at another area where they get trained on how to use FACS( Facial Action Coding System). Would parnets have to help apy for there students to use this new technology, would they have to raise money to get this in this in their schools?

9A663F9C7C49,"In a class room situation it would be so amazing to be able to see how everyone is feeling and how they feel about a certain subject. So, As a example if you used this system in a math class you could give out equations and make the students solve them. Another way this could be used is if you put it in a musical classroom and let the students play music would the music have a effect on the students emotions? I think a amazing place to put this system would be in the cafe during lunch periods just to see what the effect of food does to the students. So, In a math situation where you give students equations to solve and see what their emotions are about the equations it would be great to know how well they feel about the problems.

So, If the students where sat down for a hour and a half with a math problem and where confused the system could alert the teacher and the teacher could provide extra help. While in a musical classroom we could see what the effects of a musical piece has on students to see if musical classes are worth keeping in school systems. In lunch periods where we get to talk to all our friends and relax seeing what kind of emotions that adds to a students day could be really helpful.

I think overall adding a system like this into a classroom situation would be very helpful. As long as it was accurate it could help students out a lot more and provide better grades over all. Also, This system could be used a teachers asssistant and help the teacher know who needs help. These are some reasons I think adding a system like this into a school enviroment would be very helpful.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
DDBEF6D1B2C7,"A computer software that scans your face, just to see what your feeling. The company that makes 'Facial Action Coding System' is trying to encourage schools to have these devices in their classrooms. Isn't it bad enough most of us is already trying to learn take test on computers? I don't believe classrooms should have FACS at this point of time. I do believe that our world is making new developments on this type of technology, and their idea of FACS could be improved on the near future.

One of the reasons why I believe schools should not accept this software is because it could not be safe. Yes, it is incredible to show emotions, but a camrea on your child while they work. It could be a little creepy or even stressful on them. When they work they want to feel at peace so they can work without destractions. If you put a camrea on a child they will get distracted, and feel an abondence of pressure they do not need. Your child is at school, if the teacher can not tell a student is having trouble or bored, then there is an issue.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" ""Then it coul modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Dr. Huang predicts. Personally if a child is getting bored or confused, why doesn't he raise his or her hand up, and ask the teacher to explain it to him or her better, or make it more exsiting. Will some teachers get mad? Possibly, but possibly not. Teachers could take this feedback, and teach in many different ways instead of one or two certain ways, as FACS does. Teachers are all different and creative, so are the students. FACS could make it easier, but some students will still probably get confused and become bored in front of a screen all day. Students should stick with a classroom enviorment, and not a computer lab for 8 or more hours a day.

""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" says the author in paragraph 7. I think it's very impressive to use that material, but in a different enviorment. A school should be a safe place for students, teachers, and staff people. Students should know by now that if there is something wrong they need to go talk to someone. Now days so many things are happening in schools, it is completely crazy. Some students are now having a lot more chances in speaking with a person in their school district, than they did back then. Teachers and staff also should see the signs of emotions of their students. A computer software can determine these emotions, but can it help them? I don't believe so, and I'm sorry if you do not agree.

FACS is an amazing and fresh device people can use. In my opinion it can be a great material for counsilers and theripists. For schools though, I don't see it working out very well. What if a hacker sets in the computer, and can see what people are doing? New technology is scary, but maybe Dr. Huang is an amazing inventor, and has checked these terrifing details already.

62C8CACA3CD3,"In my opinion I don't think it is neccesary to use that type of technology in the class room because you can tell when someone isn't paying attention or if they're really bored just by their body language. You can tell a lot just by a persons body language or how they are acting.

In paragraph 5 it states that,""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by look on her face"". You can also tell how a person is feeling by their body language. If their head is down you might think they feel sick,tired, or they might not want to talk to anyone. It is east to tell when someone it feeling happy because when they are happy they stand up straight,have a smile on their face. A person's attitude can tell a lot about someone. For example if you can their name and the answer ""what!"" it can mean they are annoyed by someone or something. Another example can be when you're talking to someone and they answer you with no emotion on their face,and they slumped down in a chair can mean they are either tired and don't have any engery to do anything and maybe want some time to themselves.

My other reason why I disagree is that FACS might cost the school a lot of money. Instead of buying this technology why not buy more books or take field trips. Why buy something that might be used once rather than save the money and use it for soemthing good. Like buying better computer for the school or buying materials for the classes.

49CC4EA5F3AF,"I don't think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. Sometimes people don't want others to know how their feeling and why their feeling like that. Also, some people might think it's invading their privacy if they didn't give the person permission to read their emotional expressions.

Reading other peoples emotional expressions without permission can cause the person to get angry because they might not want others to know how their feeling. I think it would be better to see how the person is acting and if you see that they aren't acting the way they usually do then you can ask them how their feeling or if their okay instead of using technology to read someones emotional expressions. For example, in the text in paragraph 5 it talks about how you can tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face. Some people don't like others knowing how their feeling because they might think that the person is going to go off and tell others. They might be afraid that their going to make fun of them.

Using technology can give you false information if not used properly. It can read that your happy but in reality you can be sad or angry you just aren't showing it because you don't want others to know. Also, it can read that your sad but in reality your trying to show people that your happy so they don't ask you whats wrong. If the person who read your expression through their computer goes up to you and tells you they know that you aren't happy it can make the person feel angry because they were trying so hard not to let people know that they aren't upset.

Sometimes just asking someone in person how their feeling can be better than using technology because now and days thats all people use so most people don't communicate in person. Asking someone how they feel can make them feel better if they know they have someoen they can talk to and not through technology. Some people can fake their expressions so using technology won't always be as right as asking someone in person how their actually feeling.

These are a couple of reasons why I think the use of technology to read peoples emotional expressions isn't valuable to know how someone is feeling.  ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
BE8615F85409,"The facial action coding system enables computer to identify human emotions, but is it a good idea to use in a classroom setting? Is the technology even accurate? Not every emotion calculated by the machine is accurate, some people may have a great poker face, also as a human being we want our privacy just like the kids. Using these machines violates the privacy of the students that want to be left alone.

The Facial Action Coding System may not be as accurate as they say it is. In the Mona Lisa, she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fear, and 2 percent angry. This might be accurate, but the author tells the reader that technology gave the Mona Lisa its reading are based on, ""some new computer software that can recognize emotions. The software is the latest innovation..."" (paraghraph 1).

This may not be true, what if she is actually 90 percent mad and 10 percent happy. New technology always has it's flaw no matter how many people did the research. The word new needs to be emphasized, because it might be wrong. You also can't base your findings on what the machine says. The article also says that, ""each expression is compared against a nuetral face (showing no emotion)."" (paragraph 4) Every child has a different face, you have to account to many variables when using this technology. Since all children are different, their neutral face is different also, therefore you cannot base a piece of technology on one single face.

In school not every kid wants to be part of something, not all children may want the teachers attention, and not all children want to be happy all the time. Schools need to take account to the kids that might not want to be bothered by the teacher. Some just want to go to school with a blank face and get through the day and get out.

The machines will lack the privacy that kids need. Everyone wants their privacy, and having technology that scan childrens faces isn't exactle private. Schools should be a place where kids can feel safe going. By implementing that technology, you are taking a part of their privacy away, thus the child might not feel safe anymore.

Honestly i think it would be a great invention and it would sell great on products like Apple phones and also it would be great for students with homework. Technology is always growing and the new products will make it grow more and more popular. How the world is now it will become over popular and i think too much of a good thing is a bad thing like fruits they are good for you but if you eat too many you could consume a mass amount of sugar. In the passage the author said ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a smililar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" How would they know what your facial expression is? By watching through a camera and what else can the camera see? Humans relie in the enternet to bank for us, communicate for us, and know everything for us. Losing our phone is like losing our wallet. The enternet knows way too much information about us let alone when they know our facail expressions.

As much as people would love to have this technology the world could live without it. Students could ask thier techer for help so they know how to solve the hard problems. And people could learn to tell others facial expressions.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

BF86E37ABB2A,"Do you think that the use technology is valuable for detecting emotional expressions? well I think that it is not valuable for us. I will be naming some reason why in this essay. If you are intrested in knowing more of why it wouldn't be valuable for us please read on.

A reason that I think that this type of technology wouldn't be valuable to us because I don't think it is important to try to understand how someone feels or what emotions they are having at that moment. They probably wouldn't want you to know because if they did they would probably tell you. It's none of our business honestly, however how we be for sure that this type of technology would even work. There is supposed to be 44 major facial muscles in our face and the computer is supposed construct that using a 3-D model but what happenes if it misses a muscle and the calculations are all wrong. Then you wouldn't exactly know what they are really feeling. The computer would not be giving you the excat emotion.

Also, There is a mucle called orbiculars oculi pars palpabraeus that makes crow's feet around your eyes, so if computers scans someone's face that has that then the computer would give out false information about the person is feeling just because of the face when this person could really happy. Another muscle that is created is called the risorius that could put on a false smile that make your mouth skretch sideways creating a smile that could make you look happy when your actually sad. The computer could also scan a person like that and would again give false information. I believe that the computer can be wrong because everything won't be correct as they should be.

Another way, is that a person could just not smile at all like how Mona Lisa was once before and they could be extremly happy, but if a computer were to scan how that the computer would give results of sadness but that is not actually how the person is feeling. Computers just can't calculate how a person is feeling 100 percent of the time and be correct about it. Yes, a computer can communicate with humans but not emotionally. This is a new type technology can have it's ups and downs but I think that it will have more downs than ups.

However, another mucsle called frontalis pars lateralis could make you seem suprised just by raising an eyebrow but that doesn't always mean your confused or shocked it could mean many other things. The computer can calculate that your confused just by raising your eyebrow because it could calculate your face expressin not emotion. Facial expressions are universal and could all mean different things and a computer wouldn't clearly be able to tell how someone is feeling. Dr. Huang observed the artist da vinci for human anatomy to help paint mucsles precisely but his software only have similar anatomical information as electronic code, so his software doesn't the exact electronic codes it need so it could be wrong about how people are feeling.

To hence, I don't think that technology to read emotions are valuble because the computer could be wrong and not give the exact emotion, it could falsly give how someone is feeling due to a muscle in a persons face to make them look a certain way, and that the computer could not create the exact face because it mioght miss a muscle and give the wrong expression.

D89D0B91B0AE,"I am both against and for this new techonology device. It has both good and bad things to it and I will explain both why I think its a good idea and why I think its a bad idea, Here is why I think its a good idea. It can be a good idea for the guidance office of a school if a student is there for help. They can tell if the student is happy, sad, angry, or disgusted. It can help them understand what kind of emotions that practicular student is feeling, It also can be good with the example the author provided where if you smile on your computer a web ad appears but if you frown the next ad will be different. These examples are great ideas of why this technology device can be a great and helpful device.

This technology device could also be a bad idea and here is why, The device could be used on a student that doesn't really feel comfortable about giving their emotions to another person. If students have so much freedom with this device to read anyones emotions it could result in someone getting uncomfortable. Not everyone is going to want their emotions to be exposed. So if you give this device to some people they could easily humilate someone by exposing their emotions at the wrong time. For example, it could go wrong if a boyfriend was to use it on his girlfriend without the girlfriends permission and could ruin their relationship just like that.

In conclusion to these arguments supporting the technology and going against it. The device should be used in hands that are supposed to have it. Someone who has experience with the device and not anyone who is new. Someone who is mature enough to use it with polite manners, Not someone who is going to use it on each and every person they see. But use it with permission and not without someones consent.          ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
0B3AF801DF31,"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be somehow valuable, it depends who is getting a benefit from it and how the person who is being reading its expressions would feel, but in my personal opinion, I do not find it any value in a classroom.

I can imagine this system in my classroom, I would not behave freely and I think my classmates would be too. When we are in the classroom, we. some us, are there to learn and I admit that sometimes I do not understand not even a bit of the teaching lesson, and this system would benefit us because the teacher will know if we need to be more claryfied when this technology tell him how we feel about the subject, but what if we do not have our mind in the classroom and we would like some privacy, of course we will not have it, and everyone will know our deepest feelings. All of us deserve privacy, and not for only our own good. If we have some doubts and we need help, we would ask the teacher. Some of us do not do it, and might it be for a reason or we just have another source of information, we like to be independent.

If would have to argue where this system would be more valuable, I will not say some where. Everyone is free to express or not express themselves. I think that any reasonable or not reasonable person will agree with me. The use of this technology is valuable depending its purpose, and I find some advantages; when we need help and we do not know how to ask for it, and disvantages; if we are not sure if we really want it, and it is our own job to resolve our problems. There is always pros and cons.

When in school, college; learning, we are still developing skills, and to reach them we have to work for ourselves, we have to be independent and find our pathways. And with this,

I conclude that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not necessary, not valuable.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
53E6A71823D3,"There could be a day when we can use a device to identify human emotions. According to professor Thomas Huang and professor Nicu Sebe they both have collaborated and established a software where computers can recognize human emotions. This type of technology could not be helpful to teachers or any person who would want to see an emotional experssion of a person. Teachers should not even be bothered attempting to use the Facial Action Coding System to identify there students emotions.

Us humans are very fasinating we have an instint when someone is sad, mad or happy. In the article it tells us ""You can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the looks of there face.""(P.5) The text itself even says that we can tell when someone is feeling the way they are by the looks of there face, we do not need a computer to detect someones feeling's.

Teachers know there students they see them everyday for a long period of time, they most likely are not going to be close to them but some students do become close to a teacher. In the text it says ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face.""(P.4) The author is telling us that everytime they do a emotinal expression they compare it to a regular photo. How can that show what people are feeling? In most cases most people have a neutral face when they are sad, mad or happy, they are this way because maybe no one taught them how to express their feelings. So how can you really know how that person feels?

All in all teachers are good the way they are, they do not need to dectect there students feelings. Although it would be nice to use it and come across it but teachers can ask how that person is feeling themselves.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
9DFECC3D6D24,"While the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto talks in great depth about the science behind how we make certain expressions and what a computer can do with that, the author does not mention what is really causing these emotions, whether it is happiness, anger, or disgust. However, the truth behind emotions like these is human interaction. Without it, a person might not feel anger or sadness, but they might not also feel happiness or joy. One movie called ""Interstellar"" shows a character who has spent years on a foreign planet without the ability to communicate with any other human being. When he is finally discovered, he mentions the horrible pain and loneliness that stemed from an absence of other people. Technology and robotic machines are being slowly integrated into every part of humans' lives, and perhaps there will be no more need for certain professions to be filled by actual people. While the use of the Facial Action Coding System might prove to help identify emotions, it would not be worthwhile in a classroom because it would require one-on-one interaction with a teacher and even transform the classroom into a robotic impersonal environment.

Even if the program would successfully be able to indetify emotions in a student, it would be near impossible for a teacher, robotic or otherwise, to react to each individual students' feelings. Perhaps the technology of facial recognition will eventually become efficient enough that it can read the emotions of a person in less than a second, but what good can this really do? A teacher only has so much time every day to interact with his or her students, and definitely not enough time to talk in length with each one individually. Dr. Huang, an expert mentioned in the article, tells the reader, 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.'"" But what if there is only one student in the back of the class who is confused? The teacher cannot be expected to slow down the whole lesson for this one student and force the rest of the kids into boredom. The only time this might actually make a difference is if the entire class, or almost everyone, was confused and the teacher would then take the time to explain the lesson in greater detail. However, most teachers today already have the ability to read their students' emotions. It is not hard to discern when a full room of high schoolers, for example, needs further clarification. Dr. Huang also mentions, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.'"" However, what he does not mention is the other portion of nonverbal communication: body language. That is, body language outside of facial expressions. A very large portion of the way humans express themselves is through body language such as crossing the arms across the chest, bouncing a leg when he or she is bored, etc. Technology doesn't have the capability to analyze this yet. Perhaps it will someday, but for now, attempting to bring this program into the classroom would be unnecessary and potentially expensive and time-consuming.

Additionally, for this program to be most successful, teachers would likely be gradually phased out and replaced by virtual or robotic instructors, an idea that, while perhaps more efficient, will create an impersonal environment in the classroom. Using this program or not, there is no doubt that many people have speculated about the use of robotic teachers sometime in the not-too-distant future. Even Dr. Huang mentions it in the article when he says, 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" The use of this program would encourage the replacement of human teachers. However, is this really the best direction to go? If a random student was asked to think back to their favorite class period, it is fairly plausible that they would mention something about an actual teacher. Maybe the teacher participated in a fun activity with the students or told a funny joke. Either way, the experience of interacting with real human teachers is simply irreplacable. The author, Nick D'Alto, later goes on to state, ""Empathy (feeling someone elses emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions."" As mentioned in a previous paragraph, human interaction is one of the most significant reasons humans are capable of feeling true emotions. Ask anyone what their best memory is and they are almost certain to mention something with another person whether it be a family member, spouse, or close friend. Empathy, as D'Alto touches on, is essential to feeling emotions with the people around one another. So much of these necessary actions would be taken away once real teachers are replaced by artificial ones. It would take almost all remaining enjoyment out of school and form an environment in classrooms that is lacking feelings and is uninviting.

In summary, integrating the Facial Action Coding System into the classroom is impractical and unnecessary. That is not to say that the program does not have many uses in other areas of the world, but its uses in the classroom are minimal. It would waste time and effort for a result that is not notably helpful. Perhaps the developers should first focus on its other uses such as on a website or in video games instead of in the classroom. Schools do not need programs like this and they will only eliminate the living breathing system that is already in place.",6,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,1.0
B5CE3C6DAAD9,"The FACS system, in other words the Facial Action Coding Sytem. There has been new software that has been developed that improves the accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The new software has promised to have applications for variety of industries. When the process begins with the computer starting to construct a 3-D computer model of the face all which measure out to get thr 44 major muscles, the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called ""action unit.""

Facial expressions for each emotion are universal, accoriding to Dr. Huang. Though most of individuals often show varying degrees of expression, using the new technology system would use the video imagery for a new recognition software tracking their facial movements. This would not only be available for the face but also for painting which would make it very intresting to see how the persons face that is on the painting was feeling at the moment or occasion. It could even identify mixed emotions between the expression used to compare a neutral face. For example, te humans perform the same impressive ""caculation"" every day. When you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on the person's face. Much of the people that would try to tell the actual facial trait that would be happy or worried the person would be feeling at the moment.

Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, it shows of how much the computer is able to do with just having the face but still obtaining the right predicament of what the person was feeling which for Mona Lisa was happy. To an extent the system could help even more than just getting to know what people's emotions are. In the passage it had said that if you were to smile or frown on an ad then it would determine what kind of ad would pop up. Thats honeslty great because wouldnt just help the person but also the ads company that had provided it. Another show of creation by the system is that it could make a computer-animated faces more expressive for like video games, or video surgery. This could defentiley have an impact on many workers or company's hoping to improve their software not only themselves but for the people that are into it. According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also even could help produce them. Even for the people that are into drama club, could help improve the way they act. This is proven by even an exprienced drama coach, his actors caredully reproduced smiling and frowing as a way of creating these emotions on stage. Also Empathy may happen because we unconsciouly imitate another person's facial expressions.

Finally, this usage of the new system Facial Action Coding System could very useful for students in the classroom for which you could know the feelings of your pears or emotions at the moment. Sometimes people may not be feeling well or are just not in the mood would probably like to know that people understand what they are feeling thanks to the system. Also in a case of someone getting nervous about something or scared, the school could quickly find out to indeed help the kid in need of assistance.

This would benifit the classroom by letting the teachers know what makes them instrasted in the classroom. When you look tierd and about to sleep the teacher will try and do something different to help you pay attantion. Just like speaking in a different tone or walking around the classroom to get someone's attantion.

Us humans do the same thing as-well just like easily looking at someones face on a date or in a classroom to she either they like you or they don't like the way your expressing yourself. It would also help if your in a room full of strangers and wanting to get to know them but you can't really know what to say or if they would like the conversation.

What the computer does when they are calculating a face is that they compare it with a neutral face. Just by using video imagery, the new emoion- recogition software to track the facial movements. There are facial expressions for each emotion on your face but even tho individuals often show varying degrees of expression.

All in all this invention would be amazing to have. You can use it on students and see if there instrasted in a subject and how well the teacher's behavior effects them as well.

''Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'' This means even on the computer can calculate his or her face them changing their motion or expression. Also, computers can calculate how you change your muscles to indicate which emotion your feeling at that moment like in the article it talks about how your muscles movements move, ''For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when your're surprised; your obricularis oris (around your mouth) tightens up your lips to show anger.'' This shows that with these movements of characters it can show what kind of emotion a student is feeling in a classroom.

And if we were able to have The Facial Action Coding System, it could possibly help students get back on track very easily.

In the text I read about how The Facial Action Coding System was able to, ""calculate emotions"". And like I said I think this could be very beneficial to students and adults in the Educational Field and the Work Field. For example, in the text it says, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This shows that the FACS is following your mood, so whatever mood you have the following ad will appear. This could be the beginning of participation. In addition, they also say that a classroom computer could detect or recognize when a student is becoming bored, confused, or unamused, according to Dr. Huangs prediction. They also say, ""It could be an effective human instructor."". This could be very effective on students and teachers.

So why not try to make it to where the computer can also detect if the assignment the teacher gives is too hard or too easy. For some student if it is too hard they won't do it because they dont understand it. If the assignment is too easy then the student won't be challenged to use their brains. The computer should be able to detect the emotions of bordom or lack of interest and rearange the assignment to make it more interesting while still teaching what the teacher assigned.

In conclusion I would agree that the use of technology that can detect emotions would be valuable, because it would benifit both the student and the teacher.

Finally in this article,""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" which enables computers to be able to identify human emotions. The first thing that I talk about is that students in a science classroom performing a lab experiment were to read their partners facial expressions. The second thing that I talk about is how Professor Thomas Huang, of the Beckam Institute for Advanced science was able create this new technology, none this be possible without his new technology the ""Facial Action Coding System.""

FB816F612E4D,I think this claim would be very usefull in a students environment. The resone I feel as why this facial action coding system would do well in schools is because. The student mind is very fragial and kids might be sad from being bullied and might not express how they feel. With this type of technaloge school can lower the risks of suicides or school shooting by trying to help the child in any way they can. And also can stop kids that bully eachother or can even provent harmful perents at the childs home. It is sad to hear that one of your fello class mates has just commeted suicide. And me of all SCHOOL_NAME students should know how that feels and if there was something that have could provented that I would have done everything in my will to. one of my close friends dies 1/1/2018 from commeting suicide #lilpesoworld #neverforgotten #alwaysinourhearts ,2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2

The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinchi studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convery specific emotions. His new computer software stores smilar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of ""Da Vinci Code""! The Mona lisa demonstation is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. The muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around my eyes. The muscles will not make lie, so Mona Lisa have wonder parts of human. Empathy may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.

These are essay, so we can know the Dr., Hung and The Vinci are so good person and very smart because my summary shows that.

A30DE3C171BE,"This computer system is something that could change alot of things including how students and other people feel about their emotions. This could change the lives of a lot of people and a lot of people could use it like poice officers or somebody in the FBI to figure out an investigation or even a doctor could use it to see if somebody is really in the mood they seem to tell the doctor they are in.

This type of coding in a computer could be good for people who are making ads for the people that are browsing the internet and they could be posting ads that people would look at while they are in a bad mood or a good mood. This Facial Action Coding System is gonna be very useful for analyzing paintings like the Mona Lisa painting by showing the expression of face it has on it. By looking at the expression of face on the Mona Lisa painting, we could see what mood the painter was in at the time of the painting and by the story it looks like he put a bunch of effort and detail into that painting, almost like he wanted to use it for this new software. I think that using this on students in a classroom would be very rewarding for the students because the teacher could use it to tell if the students are bored and then the teacher could change up the lesson and make the students follow along more. Yes I do think this is a very valuable software towards students and teachers in a classroom.

This could be the future of teaching, the teachers would stop having boring lessons, and the students would be more productive and they would listen so much better to the lesson the teacher is teaching.

This is where basically the software is determined to be valuable or not valuable. I think the software would be an excellent thing to have and start it off in all schools, they could use it when visitors buzz in, they could use it to analyze their faces and it would let the staff know if the visitor was nervous, mad, or happy. This would be excellent for schools and then it could be spread around to other places, like the local police station and other places like that.

In the text kids would ask if this machine really worked, like tthey were intrested in knowing what it was. The computer can help with teachers because if the students are feeling down or something is wrong with them, the system can see whats going on and what type of mood their in so you can try and make them feel better. It also says that the facal expressions are universal, and that using a video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks the facial movements. Thats another way why I feel like this system is helpful to students in a classroom. This system can go so far with so many different things dealing with all types of emotions including mixed emotions. It also goves you examples on how a computer will know if your sad or not, and alot of students in a classroom would find that satisfying. One example to that is saying if you smile whena web ad appears on your screen, a smiliar ad as the first one might follow. But if you frown, the next ad while appear to be different on your screen. I find that so amazing, that theres so many ways in the electronic community just to come up with new out of the world things, and this is one of them. For that, I feel like yes this system is valuable to students in a classroom. But not just one classroom of students, but students from all over the worls.

The reason why I do want this technology is classrooms is because teachers now can understand what is going through our heads when they are teaching a lesson. They can understand if we aren't getting the information that they are teaching into our heads. They can use this in the furture to better understand how to teach and how to make lessons better. This technology can change the world. This could also help in a school way by artwork like the Mona Lisa. With this technology we can now see her emotion, and with other paintings or artwork just like this. We can now connect to the artist who made it. People all over the world can now understand the artwork.

Another reason why I think we should use emotional expressions is because in the past we really can't know what a person is feeling. You can try and hide it or you can put on a fake smile and everyone believes it. We can use the emotional expressions to prevent sucide. 8th grade to 12th grade, everything is changing your friends, your family, your school, and your teachers. When growing up into a adult life can be very rough. This could help because now we ca see how needs to and how we can help them. In this acticle it says "" classifed six basic emotions. Happiness, surpise, anger, digust, fear and even sadness."" We can get emotions out of that are to scare to come through but are wanting help but dont understand how to.

I believe this type of technology is a great way to read students' emotional expressions for not only educational use but for human interactions.

FACS would be put into great use of technology for students' due to the amount stress, and confussion students' may be recieving, while doing assignments or assessments. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" (6) This type of technology, could provide a tutor to appear on the screen, and help the student with anything they are in need of. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" (6) This may also result in ways students may accumulate these skills during musicals or plays.

Another way FACS could be used, is for human interactions. This may be useful for: family matters, employment, interviews, meeting someone. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" (3) This can help tell the person whether they are happy, sad, confused, dishonest, etc. and give the person a way to respond to the situation such as a lie. ""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot whena a ""smiling"" polotician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" (8)

D7445DE18A83,"Have you ever heard of FACS? FACS stands for Facial Action Coding System. This type of technology can supposedly read your facial expressions. When I heard of this I wanted to believe but I just couldn't. I didn't think it was valuable enough to consider. I found too many flaws in the system from the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto.

In this article I found many things that I need to point out. The article states ""New software has been developed that improves accurracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The reason I include this is because there is a key word that some of us might skip over. The word that they use is improve. But before in the passage they claim it can detect the emotion. Now it is saying it can only improve on what we as humans can do.

What is not right about it either is it only includes major muscles, 44 to be exact. But thats not the point, the point is that it doesn't include many small features in the face. So this system isn't as accurate as it sounds. The small features if they included them would make it more accurate and then they could make the claim that it is 100% accurate.

In paragraph 6 they do have an ok point. The passage states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could change the lesson."" If this was the case you would still have many students that would get bored for any lesson. Those computers aren't garunteed to teach them the standards that mybe the state requires. We haven't even talked about expenses. This must cost a fortune for a whole school and some schools would be left out of this. They wouldn't be given the same education of many other students around the United States.

So to wrap this up I don't think it is very valuable to have this in a classroom setting. Maybe in the future we might be able to have something like this where everything is changed. With the circumstances right now no way could this work. Too much effort has to go into this and technology is getting out of hand anyway.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

This technology is clearly useful and effectivge in a classroom setting. Using this technology may mean that a lot of classroom learning will need to be completed on computers, but lets be honest, that is what our world is coming to anyways. Technology is taking over our lives and almost everything, from shopping to communicating, is being done online.

Or for when the lesson just really isn't grabbing your attention and for the computer to know you're bored? With the Facial Action Coding System it now can. This is exactly why this technology that reads the emotional expressions of your face in the classroom is valuable.

One extemely important thing that can ruin a class lesson is the students getting bored. Staring at a screen for hours a day can make your mind wander, becoming sidetracked by the lose string on your sweater or maybe the picture on the wall. This wouldn't have to happen if schools had Facial Action Coding System. The system would quickly scan the face and know that this student just isn't interested and change the lesson format until the student is. This way the students wouldn't get bored. This program would keep it fresh and hold the attention of the student, scanning to make sure they're happy.

Another serious problem online learning may hold is confusion. When you're with a computer you don't exactly get the same hands on lesson you would have a teacher. If a student gets confused with a problem they may not have someone around to help them and they may not know how to work exactly how the computer can help. So they guess that answer and get it wrong and over time they may even fail the class. But with the Facial Action Coding System is could easily scan the face and see the confusion all over the student and modify the lesson till the student understand.

With the basic problems aside from digital learning, solved with the program, it can become more common. If students aren't having troubles with the computer lesson, because they're getting a more hands on approach with the computer now knows what they want, then they're going to soar beyond what earlier generations have. With the combination of Facial Action Coding System and going at the students personal pase that computer lessons provide, a student won't be held back. It provides many new opportunities for learning, with this program, than ever before.

With the information provided about the very positive effects Facial Action Coding System its easy to say that it would be beneficial to a school learning environment.

The reason why this can be a major impact in the class room is that it can read your facial expresstions. Teachers can see if students are struggling or if they are goofing off in class. Teachers can use this type of tool in the class roon to see what they can't see from their desk. This device can read six emotions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Also can associate with peoples movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscles (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recogntion software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weightign the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpice). Each expresstion is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

We has humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell hoe a friend is feeling simply by the look on his/hers face. Of course, msot of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Yet Dr. Huang observes that the facial recognitinal machine works wonderfuly and would be amazing in any class room.

In conclustion, i belive that this device should be in schools all round that United States. My reasoning is when people come in the school that system can do backround checks on parents or adults that come into the buliding.

Some other ways the FACS may be good invention is that it can be used as a lie detector. As said in paragraph 8 you use different muscles for a genuine smile than for a false or fake one. It can be used by the FBI in interviewing or interogation. Or you could see when a politician is faking it also conveyed in pagraph 8.

9C3DE25AF92A,"We as people make assumptions every day all day. I read in an article that new technology is being created to read the facial exspressions on a person and determine the way a a person might be feeling. This technology is called the Facial Coding System. I believe the Facial Coding System would be valuable to students in a classroom or anywhere else for that matter.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."", The reader is being told that with this new software scientist can now ""caculate"" emotions. Dr. Paul Eckman is the creator of the Facial Aaction Coding System and he has classified happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, and sadness as the six basic emotions. Manypeople would ask how can a computer see or feel those six basic exspressions? Well, according to the text Dr. Huang stated,""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"". They used video imagery recognize a real face and even the painting of mona lisa. There are more steps that go into the Facial Action Coding System.

After the different units are weighed out the software will identify mixed emotions. According to paragraph four,"" Each expression is compared against aa neutral face (showing no emotion)"". In order for the third step to work it has to be compared to a non-facial exspression. We as humans do the same type of steps when making an assumption. Think about the way we can tell if our friend or family member is feeling. Nomatter if they are sad, mad, happy, or glad we usually can see or feel how they feel.

We can tell how they feel based off of the facial expression they chose to give. According to the text Dr. Huangs new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. This means that the computer code uses algorthms to figure out the facial expression just like artists do when they paint facial muscles to give off a specific emotion in a painting. Computers have rules or instructions to follow in order to complete something. Its called encoding. Encoding is not jst used for computers but, it s also used by us as humans. We tell ourselves how to feel, walk, talk, act, and many other things. Our brain sends out instructions to our entire body just like the motherboard does for a computer.

In conclusion the

Facial Coding System would be valuable to students in a classroom or anywhere else for that matter. We already have a system we use everyday as people to see how other people feel. Knowing how somebody feels can help us help them. If we could have the knowledge of definetly knowing how a person felt scientifically it would realy help us help them in understanding the trials and tribulations they might be going through.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
CE33B0E35C38,"The technology of "" Facial Action Coding System"" should not be used to read students emotions to read in a class room and the use of this technology is not valueable. Why? because no student would want to let a machine tell what their emotions are and what they are feeling. In the text it says that this technology can calculate when your face is sad, happy, angry, scared, bored.

This technology won't be able to detect all the movements of the face and detect what our feelings show threw a smile we put on our face .

Not all technology work well and if this technology were to detect a humans feelings trew their face it wouldn't work because not all tecnology work well and everyones face is different. How would you be able to detect a older humans face and a younger humans face?, not all technology would be able to calculate that and this technology will possibly pick up the wrong feeling the person makes. The person might feel sad but their face might show a bit of anger or a person might be feeling calm and relaxed but the technology might pick up that the humans face might be angry . You might be able to tell a persons feelings their the face they make, because maybe this person might be your friend and you know what faces they make when they are worried or mad or sad. Not this technology especially if it has never detected a new before and every single persons face is different. My opinion to this is this technology would not be a very good idea especially if a technology knows more about your feelings then you do. Some people might put on a happy face to show others that they are okay and nothing is bothering them but inside they might be in trouble or worried.

Many people hide their feelings/emotions so no one can make such a big deal out of them. ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

To many technology gives away many diffrent emotions though. Technology sometimes makes people happy, mad, sad upset, frustrated. But if technology could read our emotions, just imagine the wow factor. Technology should very well be tested and who else to test it on instead of students that are in school. Studets are the best test subject for a couple reason, but there is really only 1 good reason, and that is becasue most of them are teenagers to young adults.

Facial reconization technology would be great for society. A great example would be during a presidental election. Now in the article it states that with this technology, would we be able to if poiliticans were lieing or not. When U.S. watches the election wouldnt it be nice to know if a politican would actualy was telling the truth, because the the citizens of America they are told one thing that that canidate would do once in office and as a country we vote for them, just for them to never fufill there promise. The people never know who to trust anymore, and to the point to many people just decide not to vote, becuase no one can belive a politican. in the article it says this tech can read the face of Mona Lisa herself, but shes just a painting. Imagine a child who doesnt understand whats going on, they need help but dont know how to tell anyone. They can be scanned and be given help.

2F3A03CE8035,"By centering the article around technology that that is able to read students' emotions, Nick D'Alto makes a great case that this developement would be a direct benefit to the learning environment. If this new technology is implemented in schools, educators will see test scores rise and see positive behavioral effects in children because of the use of emotion reading technology.

One of the most important aspects to consider when designing an education experience is whether or not it is beneficial, and more importantly, if it will keep students engaged. Dr Huang theorizes is paragraph 6 that a classroom computer could recognize when a student becomes distracted or confused, and the computer could alter the lesson and make it more useful. This could largely impact the education system by allowing each and every individual student to have a customized lesson plan based on their reactions to the origional one. With this new innovation, schools could become more efficient and churn out more successful students than ever before.

One of the many duties a teacher has is educating the students, but one of the most important roles a teacher can play in a students life is implementing discipline. As described in paragraph 8, this technology has the ability to screen people on whether they are being truthful or deceitful. Just like lying politicians, kids can get away with a lot. If bad habits continue to follow them throughout school, they will end up with a criminal potential later in life. Emotion reading technology could possibly save a students future if the teacher could read if the kid is being truthful or not. If a young child is found to be lying, the teacer could effectively discipline the kid and end the bad habit at an early age. Another example would be if kids are really telling the truth if they understand the lesson or not. If kids are truly confused and won't admit it, the emotion sensing technology would read their faces and the teacher would be alerted that the students don't undestand the lesson. These forms of accountability would instill morals and discipline in children and prevent them from forming bad habits at a young age, and eventually lead to a better and more just society.

Overall, emotion reading technology would be a strong benefit to society and specifically the education system. By being able to understand eachother better, the human population has the ability to evolve and become more intelligent, compassionate, and responsible. If it takes a new technology to bring people a higher understanding of eachother, than that technology should be implemented in not just the education system, but many other institutions around the world.

DCCDEC3F06CB,"Imagine a world where emotional reading is performed by robots, and raw human emotion is simply binary code. This could be a reality if the classroom is converted into such a world. The use of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable, due to the lack of the software's ability to decipher verbal emotion, the ability of humans to naturally perform the same techniques as the software, and the cost effectiveness of this kind of software within a classroom setting.

The first reason why the use of the FACS within the classroom would not be valuable is due to the inability of the software to understand verbal emotion. When a student is confused and or emotional about a topic, often they will express this through verbal communication. The FACS is not able to register this kind of emotion, at least not this early in it's development. As cited in paragraph six of the article, "" 'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers will need to understand that, too.' "" This statement also brings about the issue of emotional expression not on the face, including body language and stature. These reasons defend the idea that FACS is not a valuable software for the classroom.

FACS also is not valuable because it is not diverse enough in its usage nor its abilities. Teachers and peers can easily spot emotions just as easily, and often more accurately, than this machine. As cited in paragraph five of the article, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day."" This would lead this invention's discovery to be unneeded and unneccesary, unless in it's applications of the distinguishment of the emotions of century old art pieces.

The software itself would not be cost effective, with the extravagance of it's research. As cited in paragraph one, ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam."" This two Professers are of very renowned within the hierarchy of education, and the software itself is a product of the two researchers. This would lead one to believe that the software would not be cost-effective, especially within a state-funded school district.

To synthesize, the Facial Action Coding System would not be a valuable tool within the classroom because it lacks the ability to de-code other sensory based emotional expressions, can be replaced by humans, and is far too expesive. Although the software is useful, it is not practical nor diverse enough to be used within the classroom. If the FACS could be more efficient, especially with it's purpose, it might be a candidate for a positve addition to the classroom, but presently, it serves no new purpose.",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8

Being abble to hide emotions from onthers is not that hard, you van put on a smile and act happy around others and be different be yourself happenes all the time with teens and young adults. Will the machine be able to detect that? Or will it show the outer emotions rather than inner.

This may help a lot of schools witth kids who dont like sharing their feelings, but at what cost will it take fot them to make kids go out and do this? Will it be something thats mandatory or will it be a choice? Thats the question we need to be asking, will it help teens and kids overcome feelings they dont like sharing or will it hurt them even more knowing they felt something that they have been denying all along. Also how do we know if thats correct?

Students get told all the time by teachers, parents, and a lot of other people that expressing their feelings is very important and to do it to someone they trust. Will this take that away the connection between two people sharing feelings, will we turn intoa society that relies on a machine to tell us our emotions? In mu opinion schools shouldnt make or even give this option to students it is giving them an ""escape"" to talking about their feelings, will it be worth it in the end?

I think this is a bad idea for the technology emotional thing to be in class room to read students emotion becuase if a student is upset for a reason and the emotional mechine read there feeling maybe the student didnt wanna tell there personal binusness about there feelings.

This software is able to detect percentages of emotions on your face, all you have do do is look in a camera. But, should this be used on student computers? I think that this software should not be used on students computers because of distractions, the speed of the computers, and the anxiety of somebody always watching you. I can see the argument for this software going both ways, but I would not want a camera watching me all day.

This software can be very distracting. Say a student is getting bored with the lesson being taught in class that day. They might decide to play around with facial expressions to see how their laptop with this always-watching software reacts. This can cause the student not to hear the lesson being taught, or make it easier by tricking the software. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" it tells some of the facial expressions you can make to get this software to react.

Have you ever dealt with a slow computer due to something not running properly? With this software on school laptops, they will be so slow that nothing at all will work. As a result of this speed issue, students will fall behind in class, and at home. This software is much to massive for a school laptop. To run this you would need a state of the art computer costing you thousands of dollars. ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorythems used to decode Mona Lisas smile."" Schools can't affort to give every student a computer capable of running this software.

Anxiety. It is a growing problem in the United States today. Anxiety of people judging you, stress from work, or just nervousness. This facial recognition software on school computers would bring anxiety to a whole new level. The thought that someone is always watching you is not a good thought. This program will not only feel like you are constantly being watched, but in a way will be true. The software always tracks you facial expressions, your emotions, to adapt to how you ""feel"". Also, imagine how easy it would be to hack into this intricate software. It would be fairly simple to someone with experience. If someone were to hack into the camera, they could constantly watch you. As long as your computer is opened up, they are watching you.

Did you change your opinion on this software? It is terrifying to know that someone could be watching at any time they choose.

04C90EF1C88A,"In the article ""Making Mona Lise Smile,"" the author describes a wonderful technological advancement called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). This technology allows for computers to analyze a human face and determine the emotion, or emotions, that person is feeling. With the help of this new software, Professor Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at tge University of Illionois, and Professor Nicu Sebe, of the University of Amsterdam, were able to determine that the Mona Lisa is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. This outstanding innovation can be very beneficial to society. They have created something that can not only help us have a better understanding of the body, but can also change the way we communicate in drastic ways.

With FACS we, as people, will be able to better understand the anatomy behind joy, depression, anger, all of it! We will have access to parts of the brain that millions of scientists have never understood. FACS creates oprotunity for discovery far beyond what we already know. For centuries scientists have been asking, ""What makes a happy person happy?"" and ""What is causing all these mood swings?"" With these advancements applied, we can know when a change in mood happens and use brain scans to figure out where and why this is happening.

""Communication is key!"" That's something we all hear all of the time but no one seems to be any good at. The suicide rate is out of control and the divorce rate is crazy high. Using FACS we can deminish these numbers! A simple understanding of the emotions another human is displaying can change, and save, lives. If we have the technology to understand what a person is feeling, then we can fix things before they completly fall apart. We can offer solutions to the problems that people are facing everyday simply by understanding how they feel and what is causing their hurt. This technology could be the difference between wether or not your parents stay together or your friend jumps off a bridge. That is why I believe this technology should be immediately incooperated into society. It can save lives, it can save love.

4727C5135BC7,"Is the ""Facial Action Coding System"" really going to be able to read and react to students emotions? Well this new technology can read the facial expressions of a student therefore it can change the classwork based off how the student is feeling but, a computer can't really read a students true emotions just based off their facial expressions.

The ""Facial Action Coding System"" created by Dr. Paul Eckman is used in a new innovation created by Prof. Thomas Huang, Prof. Nicu Sebe and their collegues. This Innovation is a sort of program that allows a computer to read a persons emotions based off their facial expressions The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, states Dr. Huang. Although the facial expressions of a person are similiar to another like smiling for example, however we may unconsciously have an expression even though we are not feeling the emotion that expression conveys.

""Empathy (feeling someone elses emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another persons facial expressions."" this shows we may show an expression without truly feeling that emotion the expression suggests. Therefore can this technology really help a student in a classroom setting?

A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. with this said it may become frustrating or irritating to the student with the constant changes. This technology sounds very convincing but think of an emotionally challenged teenager can the computer keep up or truly read the emotions of the teen just by facial expressions alone? ""Eckman has classified six basic emotionshappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnessand then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."". The technology can always improve but at the state it's in right now it may not be as accurate as needed to be in a classroom setting with only having the basic emotions proggramed. Although the technology is advanced and helpful to an extent it may not be something we can use right now.

This technology is helpful but also not good enough for students to enjoy and be helpful. This technology as previously mentioned can alter the classwork a student is doing based off their emotional state. According to Dr. Huang this technology can read mixed emotions as well but with only six to go off of it may not be a truly accurate answer and may make the student feel another emotion because it could not respond properly. This technology should be tested and improved on before going in a classroom setting.

In conclusion the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a technology not ready to be put in schools but is still a good innovation. The new technology can't read all their emotions just based off expressions alone but in the future change accordingly to a students emotions hopefully based off not just expressions and be ready for students to utillize.

It seems cool but do we really know if there is a catch at all, like what if the government is just trying to find another way to watch us?

But who knows maybe there are some valuable things to come out of it, like a teacher would be able to see if there students are having a hard time on an online assignment, bored about to fall asleep, or even just having a bit of fun. It shows that they care and higher technology is coming! It is not that weird to think about actually because we can tell when somone is upset so what is the difference does that mean were weird or have something to hide?

A computer that knows when you're happy or sad that's awesome! The ""Mona Lisa"" is intended to bring a smile to our face, just imagine what a computer can do, if you smile into the Web cam to an ad you may just see more that may appear on your computer that make you happy or if you find a picture that makes you frown they'll make sure you won't see any similar pictures/ads.

The process all begans once the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. That's not the last thing it also says that according to ""Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion"" it does't only express emotions but also may even help produce them!

Are you questioning the whole situation different now? Hopefully because it doesn't sound that bad, maybe it'll be for the better, we just have to give everything a chance.               ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
E465837431CB,"There has been a new breakthrough in computer facial recognition software. This breakthrough is called the Facial Action Coding System, also known as the FACS. The FACS is a facial recongnition software that is used to determine someone or something's emotions. In the article, this software is used on the Mona Lisa, to determine that she is eighty-three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and two percent angry. Some people beleive that this software could be useful in classroms, and i agree to an extent. This software would not be as useful to students in a traditional brick and mortar school as it would to somebody taking an online schooling program. I am an online school sudent and the FACS could be helpful in several ways.

The first way that this software could be helpful to a student would be detecting if they are bored. Much like a teacher would, if this software noticed that a student was bored during class, it could take action to engage the student more. An example of this could be if a student was simply reading through a lesson, and became disinterested. The computer could then suggest that the student watch a video on the subject instead. This would bring the student a different type of lesson, and slightly change up their day to engage them more.

Another way that this software could be useful in an online schooling program is it could detect when its students were feeling frustrated. If a student is feeling frustrated, then the software could take action against that, having the student either take a break, or putting the student in contact with a teacher so that they could work through the subject together. This would help the program have a better graduation rate, as it would help struggling students.

The final way that the FACS could be useful is to detect if a given student was sad. There is a rising problem among students, and that problem is mental illness. The most common mental illness is depression, and this program could help with that on some cases. The FACS could help by detecting that the student is sad, and alerting the student's parents, or possibly even a teacher to get in contact with the student, and talk with them about their emotions. This system is obviously not perfect, but it could help detecting early signs of depression among students.

Overall, the FACS could be very useful to an online schooling program. The software could be used to detect if a student is bored, if a student is frustrated, or even if a student was sad. These are all of the reasons that the FACS would be helpful in an online schooling program.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

E84CD172D3EA,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author makes a point about this facial Action Coding System (FACS) and how it is useful in the classroom. In this essay, I will explain how this new software is useful. And how useful it would be in the classroom.

One example of this technology being used in a classroom is, ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

This gives a real life example on how it could be used in a classroom.

The author explains that we already use this in the classroom everyday. This example is, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy worried, etc."" This tells us that we use this everyday and we dont even know we use it. So we already use it in the classroom.

Another fine example is, ""The facial expressions for each smotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" This tells us that there are too many emotions to count and that it would be useful to teachers to be able to tell what the students are feeling.

Throughout this essay, I have described how the author tells us that using this technology would be useful. I fully belive that this would make the world a better place. We would be able to use it so we wouldn't hurt anyones feelings.                   ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2

Some new technology can be a major help like 3-d printers and new computers that make things more conveient for you. But when you are dealing with new technology like an emotional scanner you don't always know what you are going to get out of it. If you think about it in the long-run an emotioal scanner can help make school more interesting, They can tell you if your freinds are haveing a good time, And it can help you feel better about your self.

""A class room computer can identify when a student is getting bored or confused.""When you are in school and your teacher tells you that you he/she will not be teaching you today about your lesson, but the computer will. You will be happy or sad how ever you fell about the teacher, not knowing that there is a emtioal scanner in the computer. You start the lesson and you are starting to get bored then all of a sudden the computer sarts talking to you like an instrutor would helping you with questions and makeing fun for you. That was just one of the many ways that an emotioal scanner can help when it is released publicly.

We humans can calaculate emotions every day, when you are out with your freinds then you see one of them not haveing fun because something may have happened in there lives, and you did not know. What if you had an emotioal scanner it could tell you how to brighten up their day. Then you and your other freinds spend the day makeing them feel better so they forget what they were sad about in the first place. It could be compatable with you school life to it dosen't just help you with your lessons it can help you with your freinds problems at school to. Say that your freind just got a bad grade on a test they really studied for you can use the emotional scanner to make them fell better for the next test they take.

When you are watching videos and an ad comes up and you can't skip it,the emotinal scanner in your phone can change the ad to something that you like. So when you are sitting there and an ad for dish soap comes on in the middle of your show the emotional scanner can change instantly. When you go back into watching your show right after an ad you can feel better after it going back into your show. It could help you feel better when you come home from school. When you had a bad day the emotinal scanner can turn on your favorite video game and make you think that the school was just a bad dream.

There are many ways that an emotinal scanner can help. It could make school more intersting, it could tell you how your freinds fell, and it could make you feel better about yourself. So next time you feel sad or one of your freinds feel sad just remmber what if I had an emotinal scanner. You could change the world for the better. I f emotinal scanners where open to the public nobody would be sad ever again.   ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
6BD7D456AAD6,"The use of this techonolgy so called Facial Action Coding,is not valuable at all. As technology may be advancing that doesn't mean it can't fail us. Reading a persons facial expression will not determine their mood. Like the author said, "" The facial expressions for each emoton are unversial."" It could also have to do with their body language. Weither the person is slouching or always hiding their hands, also how their voice level is. Sure it could be easier by going at a painting, but in your point of view it's a whole different story.

Body language can determine many different things in someone. It could be weither you have a back problem, trying to grab your back because of the pain. Slouching could be not because you are tired, but maybe a syptom of depression. Since the computer is only recognizing your emotion(s). I personally do not think a computer could read or tell you that.

Voice level could be one of many signs of emotion. If one is scared or frightend, your voice can let out a shriek. One can be happy and still have either that low or a more louder voice. Computers can't figure this out and we are trying to depend on some code that was invented. In the text it says, ""muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes."" How can a muscle determine your emotion. One could be confuesd or trying to see more clearly because of the vision.

Your point of view is better than a computers understanding. Seeing a person face to face can maybe change something. They could be happy and here you come with that sad face. Then the seeing the persons emotion makes you suddenly feel better. A computer can't see what just happend between you and the person.

4BE3EE3D73A6,"Have you ever been in class and started to get bored with an assignment? Well the new F.A.C.S (Facial Action Coding System) may be able to help.

The F.A.C.S sytem is able to tell how you are feeling by reading the muscles in your face. The F.A.C.S system atrificially makes a 3-D model of your face with all 44 muscles. Those muscles are what help control your facial features for example, smiling, frowning and scowling. The F.A.C.S system is able to decode what muscles are being used to show how you are feeling.

The argument about having F.A.C.S in our school systems today is that it is constantly reading our childrens faces without them knowing. People say this is an invasion of privacy for example if a child is at home and has left their computer out when they went to go to the restroom and a parent walks up and looks at the screen it could have some teachers thinking that the students parent is doing the work for them.

I say this argument is invalid because a lot of people don't know that Google has a system in place similar to F.A.C.S where it will listen in on what people are saying and show advertisements that correnspond with that. Another thing Google does that is similar to F.A.C.S is that when you are browsing it will track what you click on and then provide advertisements for those things as well. Another example of things tracking us without knowing is that they're reports that the FBI has monitored people through their webcams if they are under suspect. With this knowledge what is the odds a hacker or someone with computer knowledge has not done this to other people as well? This is why I say the argument is invalid for F.A.C.S not to be in our school systems today.

The other side of this argument that I can support is that sometimes our kids are having bad days and with F.A.C.S monitoring them it causes them to get advertisements that make their days even worse. This could possibly cause our kids to not want to use the internet that has helped them so much and is a facle point in most schools today. Another reason why F.A.C.S might be bad for schools is that it can teach our kids how to fake an emotion to be able to hide something from us or be able to cheat the system and be able to get what they want. This is some of the reasons why F.A.C.S might be bad in our school systems.

Being bored in school can come easy at times, so the F.A.C.S system may be able to help your kid one day by making their day better. By being able to moniter the facial expressions our children have.

When knowing this technology can read faces, may it be possible to read amung students' emotion in a classroom?

Facial Action Coding System is a ""3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human mucles"". It has to move all of it's muscles in the 3-D computer to determind a facaial a human is making while using the facial gagit. We come across basic emotions like sad,anger, happy, and more that this gagit says can can pick up when scaning peoples faces, through the Facial Action Coding Systems. It even says in phargraph 3 ""Eckman has cassified six basic emotions--- happiness, suprise, angry, disgust, fear, and sadness--- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"".

When Knowing that, i dont think the mushcine could tell the students' emotion in a classroom. I only say that because, the Facial Action System can always make a slight mistake on judging how someone in that classroom feels. Just think, yes people can see others faces and make thier thoughts on what the person maybe feels, but also sometimes their judgment is wrong. I know the acticle tells me, and the other readers ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facaial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect Yet Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facaial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions"" (in pharagrah 5). I still say it doesn't matter about the studies someone has done to, or on something, technology can make simple mistakes just like humans.

In parapraph two, you can even see the author asking the readers, ""Can we actually ""cauclulate"" emotions---like mathe homwork""? Then goes on with saying, ""And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel"". When saying that it just shows that the author, and probly others that have read this acticle isn't sure about this facial computer tool, looks can always be desiving so it hard to even trust technologys judging something simples as someones facial expression.

Some people just may think the Facial Action Coding System is a very great idea, and some may not think so. It's just to hard to get a good answer on whomevers feeling it's the right technology to use.

With these two reasons we can determine the value that they would have in schools. grades would get better, some may inspire to work harder because someone or something can tell they are confused and need help. Another quote that can support my claim is that ""Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication,"" ""so computers need to under stand that, too."" What this means is that the one kid who is afraid to speak up and ask questions or the kids who cant speak at all will get better help, because the computers can identify what emotions they are feeling and help them.

A drawback to having the technology in the classroom could mean that we could give off the wrong emotions and confuse the computer it self. and this could mean ruining the techology or worse. Another drawback would be that in paragraph seven it states ""Your home PC can't handle the comples algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" this means that we would have to have advanced technology inside of a classroom, And if it is more younger kids its going to be super hard to keep it from being ruined or broken. Another set back would be People who suffer from Depression, Bipolar or PTSD can change emotions constantly and quickly.

This lets computers know if you are either sad or happy, uninterested or bored, etc. So now what? Computers are being able to comprehend our emotions, interact and even understand us? As crazy as it sounds, it can actually work in a good way.

How can a software on a computer actually benefit us, and indeed work in our way, especially if you are a student? Well, this makes computers able to understand student's feelings towards an assingment. It will indentify students emotions and help them benefit by trying to work with them. As Dr. Huang (1 of the innovators of this software) states on the passage on paragraph 6, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"".

The second is, it really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. The third is, it will help you tell if the person that is the most important to you is sad or happy.

The first reason is the Facial Action Coding System is valuable because it help the teachers identify the emotion of their student. It said in the article ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Some of the students in the school won't talk about how they are feeling in the classroom, and some of them would be scared to ask question when they are confused. The new technology would help the teachers so much on how to find out if their students are understanding the works they did in the classroom.

The second is, it really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad. Everybody in this world needs someone that could tell if they were happy or sad, so they would feel like someone is understanding them at lest.

The third is, it will help you tell if the person that is the most important to you is sad or happy. Sometime we can tell that the person is happy or sad, but we can't not tell it all the time. We can makes the wrong assumption about a person by the look on their face.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

The usage of the Facial Action Coding System in schools to determine if a student is getting bored, tired, or angry at a lesson could be very useful. If a student were to get angry or bored during a lesson they are more likely to not pay attention and if you are tired you may not retain the information as well. If your computer could sense this and alert the teacher or change the lesson accordingly then it would give students a better working enviroment and a better chance of doing well in school. This 3D construct could also help teacher's understand their students better and help them learn more efficiently. This can also see through a fake smile and know the students real emotions which is important in case the student is trying to fake it through the leason when they really need help. According the the professional Dr. Huang, he predicts that, ""A classroom somputor could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then is would modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

So in conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System can read emotions and see the real emotions present. This could lead ot improvements in the classroom so that teachers and the computor can alter the lesson as needed to the specfic student and their needs. This is a good idea because it will improve the work enviroment created for students. ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
D6EEEBA9A999,"In this article about the new technology being used on the painting of Mona Lisa the audience learns about what this new technology is really about. The first sentence of the first paragraph the author states ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Since the author begins this article with the percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions, we know that this is going to be about reading someones emotions, not only Mona Lisa's.

Further into the article we read about this technology being in computers and recognizing facial expressions. To have a computer be able to even calculate ones expression, the computer must construct a 3-D model of the face electronically. Imagine sitting infront of your own computer while having it read what you're feeling! This advanced technology is more than what we think. The technology actually improves lessons in school, based on an individuals expression.

To have this technology in a classroom, it would be highly beneficial to students and even teachers. The benefits a student would be receiving are improved grades, lesson plans that are interesting, being more focused, and having more benefits with learning than what a teacher could give. Improving grades can be hard and that could very well be because a student is just not able to pay attention to the lesson due to how boring or confusing it may be. In the article the author says ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Using this to help determine a better lesson plan for the student is great because it will make them more focused along with being interested in their learning plan. This can lead to the student knowing what they are doing on their homeowork which also leads to better grades.

Some may disagree with the opionion of having this technology used in classrooms. Others may say that no matter the lesson, the student could just simply be tired or un-interested in learning. If a student is either of those, they could very well not have a benefit to this technology. However, it is more likely that a bigger percentage of students woud have a positive outcome while having this advanced technology in the classrooms.

Those who believe that this computer technology is not valued in classrooms could think that the software might not work effectivley. When saying this, I am saying that those people may think that the technology won't really read a students expression correctly. The creators of the software could possibly not have all of this technology figured out 100 percent. Although that could be the case, we should focus on whether the students believe they are being benefitted while using it.

There will always be one opinion or the other. However, reading this article makes me believe that having this technology in classrooms would be highly beneficial to students. Getting good grades is a big part of actually being able to enjoy or understand your lesson. While having better lessons, you will most likely have better grades. Teachers possibly can not benefit the students in the way this new technology could with lesson plans and maybe more. That is why most people should believe that having the expression reading computer technology in classrooms is good for the students in more ways than one.

14236F6FEAD6,"The new technology to read emotional expressions I believe is very helpful. Not only helpful in the classroom but also in everyones' everyday life. This new technology helps determain how a person is feeling . They discovered many methods . They use our face muscles to see how we are feeling. There is six classified emotions. There is happiness, surprise, anger, disgues, fear and sadness. They'll use their very advanced technology to determain how someone in a picture is feeling or in person.

The techology is very advanced they are now using it towards ads. They'll see if they should continue putting that ad is it makes you happy or as they ""bring a smile to your face"". If it does not they'll change it and use something else to make you happy. There whole ideal idea is to make people like the thing they are putting out or showing. If the person is showing happiness that will help determain if they like it . I'll show that the person likes the idea and will like to see more of it.

Wouldnt you like to see hows a person 100% feeling. With all this new technology we'll always know how someone is . Everyone thought that the Mona Lisa just smiling. No one would've that she was 83% happy , 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry. Now we can see how everyone is feeling. Now we can calculate peoples feelings thats just another step to the future. Our technology is getting more advanced and is getting better.

I know alot of people would love this new way to determain peoples feelings. Not just by the way they look now just now a little more detailed. Now we know people arent 100% everything . Students will really find this method really helpful for there work. They can get alot of information then just one thing they can just assume but now they can be very determained in it .

I feel like that would be such a great thing to have a piece of technology. I believe that this technology is valuable because so many people might have courosity to know what a person felt in a pictures, painting, ect. In this essay I will be arguing, why I feel this piece of technology is valuble, and what differnce would it make to society.

Technology is a major part of our lives, but having a piece of technology that can read a persons emotion is a pretty impressive on how we have advanced in technology. The Beckman Institute for Advanced science at the University of Illinois was capable to make a software that can read people's emotions. the author states,"" at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions"". This proves that now theres something that can study a persons emotions.

Technology has made a big differnce between the years and to have a software that can read a persons emotions is such a huge expanced on what we know. Now that we have a software that reads a persons emotion can really make a really big differnce of society. The author states, "" the facial expression for each emotion are universal, usinf video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software can even identify mixed emotions"".

This proves that the new software is going to make such a huge differnce to our society.

To conclude, Technology is such a valuble pesesion we have in our lives. By having a software that can read emotions is a big step on making this world big. Many won't believe the same but most people in this world are involved with technology and this is going to change throughout the decades.

9A643EDCE7C0,"I think this artical is important. Our emotions are always changing. This new technology can help us in different ways. I'm for this because learn how someone feels is important in some cases. Facial experssions show how someone feels through their emotions.

The creator of FACS is an psychologists named Dr. Paul Eckman. The Facial Action Coding System is able to read an identify peoples emotion. Only the six basics which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust ,fear , and sadness. The way they found Mona Lisa's emotions was by using a 3-D computer to construct the face. They found all forty-four major muscles, the movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit on the computer.

If the FCAS was used in school it can be a benifit to students and teachers. It can show how student are acting in class to see if they're under standing or not. If someone isn't understanding then the teacher can see and talk more on that subject. If the students id doing an assinment on the computer and get the answer wrong and see confusion the system could reword the question and see if that's easier.

728610F3098D,"As many countries in the world starting on develop high techonology, the use of computers is very necessary. Scientists begin working on study new techonology to help humans lives become more convinience. One of the new uses of techonology is that reading, and identifying human emotions. While highschool students usually have trouble to know their friends, and classmates oppinions about them, the new technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" in a classroom is valuable.

The use of computers to read humans emomtions expressions is helpful, because it can read emotional expression accurately, and people will need it, especially students. Highschool students often curious about what people think about them, but somtimes they could not know what the emotion exactly means. Therefore, they need techonology that can help them, specifically the Facial Action Coding System. This techonology allows computers to analyze both simple and complex facial expressions. In order to do this, the computer has to built up 3-D movements of facial muscles, and all those movements are the same as movements of the face in real life. One more way we can tell this technology can work well is that it compares every emotion to a no emotion face, because it says ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" in the text. With its characteristics, the Facial Action Coding System can help students in classes. Students then can understand their classmates, partners easier. They would feel more confidence, and could focus on lessons better.

The purpose of studying techonology is to help humans lives become better, all techonologies are really useful and have certain value to humans, including the use of Facial Action Coding System. This is a technology that can help identify correctly people feeling base on what they are showing in their faces. When highschool students often face challenges to understand other students facial expressions, the use of this techonology is needed. It is not only because it can work well, but it also help classes more effectively by improving students feeling. This technology is very valuable, and every students will need one.

It can also show which students are board and lets teachers know that they need to make the lesson more interesting.

But I do believe that it can go farther than just the class room, the school counclers can use this to tell if someone is having issues or just a bad day. If the student is upset or angry, the counclers could help them by just knowing how they feel. It can also allow the resource room teachers to better understand how their students are feeling and how to help them.

This could help teachers ease up on the work load given to students by showing them how stressed some students are when given a lot of homework, and it can tell teachers when a student is not paying any attention. This can rebuild the relationship between students and teachers by allowing teachers to better know their students needs and limits, as in how much homework they can efficiently get done with out stressing about it. This can also help teachers push back tests by knowing who isn't getting it, or having less things on it because the students are understanding the materal.

I honnestly believe that FACS really is valuable when reading the emotional expressions of students in the class room by; telling the teacher who needs help, also telling the teacher who is board and how stressed the students are, by telling the resourceroom what their students are feeling today and how to adapt to that, and by helping the counclers by showing them who needs to get something off their chest.

The money can be spend towards a better education system and allowing our schools to get proper funding for what is needed. It wouldn't be helpful due to the fact that there is no real need for this technology when we could spend in other programs.

The money that is put into this for detecting emotions out of a straight face, but this can be considered as an invasion of privacy. This really isn't useful much due to the fact that it will try and read your thoughts practically. Even though it would be fun to see what someones mood is on a straight face, it be more of a burdon to have and wouldn't serve a major purpose in the learning enviornment. The only real reason to use it is if you were to test to see if someone was lying about a topic.

The money to invest into these machines would be costly and hard to afford for the schools that would need to buy it. This would cause the fundings for supplies maintence and learning programs to go down and would be difficult to run the school properly. This wouldn't be effective having it in the classrooms because of the software and the risk of kids possibly messing it up cause the school to fix or replace the machine. Schools already are getting budget cuts from the government so they have to ration and shorten supply due to money cost. These new machines would take up too much of the school budget.

The counter claim it that these new tools can be used to help aid with children and behavior, and allow students to be more honest with one another. This can also help the teacher see if one student is hiding something. The teacher can use the information from the software and help dicipline the students if need be. Teachers can also see if students are cheating or are lying to them and can be able to organize the class with it's help. These can be good but this new machine can invade on personal privacy and wll not help much other than dicipline.

C9EF98006357,"With some thought I really like the idea of ths FACS. Not only can it train us to know someones emotions but it can make lessons at school more intersting. If I am reading an essay about something that I do not like, obviously I will not attain as much knowledge as I should. The computer that reads my facial expressions and designs a whole new lesson per say, is the one I want.

I can see this program coming in play for a lot of applications. We could get more kids to enjoy school.

In the first parapgraph the author talks about how this program can read and understand someones emotions. They used a painting that dates back centries ago, and still can see exactly the emotion of Mona Lisa. If this program can do this to a painting, imagine what it could do in the daily life of most people! Just think about how much of us use technology. We dont always see what we want to see on social media and what not when it comes to adds. This program can read how you feel about that add and change the add the next time. Thats amazing.

In paragraph 3 the author explains kinda how it works. The only problem I could see come about is security. I mean i wouldnt want some program judging my facial expressions 24/7. So there would have to be some type of agreement and some rules. Also I would want what the programs reads about my emotions to only be shared with me and not be accsessed by others. Its a personal thing.

I was wondering about how the program could read mixed or multiple emotions. Paragraph four goes into detail about this. The author writes ""by weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" and "" Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" So I would think this software is decently accurate.

Every day at school us students are forced to read and comprehend stuff that we have no say in. It has always been like that. To me I would think if a student is enjoying what He or She is learning they will learn and attain more knowledge. That is where this software comes in. Looking around at fellow classmates, I could almost guarentee that I will not find anyone smiling. Well maybe I could but I can promise you they are not doing school work.

So again I am for sure all for this software. When you stop and think about all the applications this could be used for, it is amazing. Not only that but look at how this could change education. This software can help truly tell someone how they are conveying themselves in public. You may think you look and seem hapy, when to everyone else you look like a sad puppy.

BB7A76089910,"The Facial Action Coding System should not be used in schools to help students. There are benefits to this system, but the bad outweigh the good. This technology used to reconize emotions will affect students in ways that aren't necessary, and cause unwanted problems in the classroom.

Firstly, the article metions this system being used on computers while students are working to analyze their emotions. The author writes "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming comfused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor'"" (Alto 6). Having a computer watch students' facial expressions while working could make the students feel uncomfortable and give them anxiety. Being uncomfortable while working will effect the way a student learns. They will not be focusuing on the material they are learning, but instead the idea that they are being watched. This is a problem that's not needed in the classroom and can be avoided.

Secondly there are tons and tons of emotions a human can express. The author writes "" Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS. Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (Alto 3). Having only classified six emotions, is not a very wide range. What if for example, a student were to show an emotion that the computer doesn't have programmed and reconizes it as somthing else, changing the lesson to fit the wrong emotion? This would cause the lesson to be changed when the student didn't need it to be. This creates a technology problem along with the problem of fixing the lesson and wasting time the student could be using to learn.

Lastly, having a computer analize a students emotions while working would leave the teacher with nothing to teach or help the students with. This might seem like a good thing at first, but teachers create the classroom atmosphere and keep students ingaged in learning. Why have a computer analyze student emotions when teachers have been doing it perfectly for years?

5F68132C9D49,"Have you ever spent hours sitting in front of a computer doing school work, learning from a computer-animated face, or simply browsing the web? Have you become bored and uninterested in the process? Professor Thomas Haung has created a computer software that can detect emotions. FACS, the Facial Action Coding System, can be useful reading students' emotional expressions in many ways. A few examples include adjusting a lesson the student is learning if the software detects that they are confused or bored, making computer-animated faces more expressive, and relying on the fact that most human communications are nonverbal, including emotional communication.

If a student is spending hours on a computer, whether it be doing homework, studying, or simply learning a new lesson in school, it is likely that they will become bored or confused in the midst of their work. If the FACS were to be installed onto their computer, the software would be able to detect the students' change in expression and emotion, and modify the lesson, homework, or stuyding that the student is doing. This would simulate an effective human instructor. It would also help the student get their work done quicker, and they will become interested in what they are doing again.

FACS would greatly lend a hand in the making of computer-animated faces more expressive. This software could help show more emotions among computer-animated faces, such as disgust, sadness, fear, jealousy, etc. By showing more expressive emotions, the FACS would largely help students become more interested in what they are learning, if they are learning from a computer-generated person. If the person hardly shows emotions and is not very expressive, the student will likely become bored and uninterested in what they are doing. However, FACS can help prevent that.

An important way FACS can be of use is simply detecting human emotion. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. Because computers, and technology in general, are the future, it is vital that computers can understand that. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. However, if you frown when a Web ad appears, the next ad will be different. This will generally make the users experience on the computer more content, as they are not bothered by annoying ads.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System could greatly be useful in many ways. Students can become more interested in learning, studying, or doing homework, computer-animated faces can become more expressive, and most human communication is nonverbal, making it vital that computers can understand that.

In the article, the author describes how a classroom computer can recognize when a student is getting bored or confused based on their facial expressions. This computer can change the way that the lesson is being taught so that the students are more productive in classes. While the Facial Action Coding System detects facial expressions that indicate a person's emotion, the system built in a classroom computer is valuable to students, because it can manipulate the lesson based on how students are learning.

The ability to have a classroom computer that is able to read the emotional expressions of students, would be very valuable is a classroom, because it allows the lesson to be taught in a way that would benefit the students, according to Dr. Huang. In a normal classroom, teachers create lessons that confuse the students or do not appeal to their learning ability which creates a tension for the learning environment. With the use of this technology, classroom lessons would be more educational and responsive. This is because, the technology is able to recognize when a student is confused or bored by reading their emotional and facial expressions. This is useful since the system can alter a lesson plan to be suitable for the students in the classroom which would potentially help them learn better. For example, if a student is confused during class, it is likely that they will not ask for help, leading them to not understand what is going on in the lesson. Having this technology in the classroom, would sense this and modify the lesson so that a student would be able to learn better and understand the topics.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms would be beneficial in classrooms to both the students and the teacher, because it would allow the teacher to adjust lessons in order for more students to understand the concepts.

""New computer software that can recognize emotions"", some may view it as an invasion of privacy, or just straight up weird. I believe it could be a new way to not only help but to recognize your own feelings or your persona to others.

As we speak about the new invention I'd like to mention how it works. ""the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"", there are 44 major muscles in the model that move like a human muscle for accuracy. Someone who is not only an expert with technology works on these but also someone who is an expert in mood, stability, etc works through these. ""Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman.""

""There are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness......"" These emotions are ""calculated"" per say by looks, movements, and the facial muscles. This could help dictate the feelings of someone who is unable to speak or vocalize. Now ""putting on a happy face"" is actually possible.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
5BBC05802470,No i think having technology to read a emotional expressions of students. I think that is really not a good idea . Why because somebody dont like to know how they feeling some people don't like to express their feelings cause it's nobodys bussnies . Tell me would you let them use and technology to read your emotions somepeople would say yes somepeople would no because either the way it goes your still messing being in somebodys else bussnies and some people don't like when they do things like this makes people think that where watching their life . No i disager with the technology to read emotional expression becaue it's like their trying to find a good way to gets us totechnology againts use and try to take over are emotions think about it. Think about how something bad can happen ifthey use the technology to read expressed something can go wrong to where the technology ain't gone be working like its is supposed i think they trying to use itn against take over are mine makes us feel how they want us to feel say what they want us to say   ,2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
AA3B0AF13AA2,"I kinda do agree with this problem. Tech can tell whats everyone mood is at at the moment and i also agree on you can read on people faces if they are upset or something. Tech tells you how to handle your problem and tell you what you should do. but, face emotions can speak louder than words and thats true. also wehn people take pics of each other, that show it all as well. there are many ways that your emotions can be shown not just by phone and other Tech. People try to lie about there emotions and sometimes, that can lead to life risks. If that person really sad then and always upset, then that person might think something that you dont want to see. over the years, people is scared to tell other people what they think or what they should do. Some people dont relized that other poeple can help that person that is going through something that they should be going through. everyone shounld think about the bad stuff and always should think about the good things. now that being said, computers can read other people emotions and i believe it should give them tips to forget about whats going on.

CB440174C470,"Though the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is very interesting to read about, I do not believe it should be present in the classroom. There are a few issues I believe could be argued against using this software in a classroom setting. The FACS should be developed more and put through serious testing before being put in the classromm setting, but there were several other valuable uses for the program. The problems with the system in a school setting are the complexity of the system, the possible issue of privacy, and the accuracy of its predictions.

The FACS is a great idea that could have many applications other than schooling and several of these are included in this article, but it is currently too complex for school networks to handle. The author states outright in paragraph seven, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" The school computers that we use are even more out of date than the one I use at home and if it cannot run the system the school won't be able to without a major upgrade of technology or a major downgrade of the FACS, neither of which is desirable. The technology uprade needed for school computers would be too large of a bill to be practical in all but the richest of schools. The downgrade of the system to a simpler form will essentially defeat it's purpuse by killing its effectivity.

Another issue with the FACS in a school setting is privacy. How are we to be sure that they are not going to use our faces to gain access to things such as confiscated phones or to possibly find profiles online of students? Because this system requires a camera to see your face and put it through a detailed analysis, facial recognition security software like faceID on the Iphone X

then becomes a security concern. In paragraph six the author also mentions, ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This system in schools would essentially let the build a personal marketing profile on every student in the country.

The accuracy of the FACS would also have to be put through intense testing to determine how effective it actually is. Prof. Huang says,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" If the system thinks that a student is confused when they actually aren't though, it could hurt their academic growth. It would be changing the material to a lower level in an attempt to interest them, but also at the same time lowering their understanding of the material.

In conclusion, I do not believe that this system would be as effective of a tool as it needs to be to offset the dangers it poses. The money needed for the complexity, the threats to privacy, and the questionable accuracy and adaptability of the system are too concerning to support the FACS as it now stands. If these concerns were addressed the possibly it could be an effective tool, but for the foreseeable future it is not.",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8
C275B257FC61,"Emotions the things that make us feel happy,sad,angryand scared. But they also show our humanity its difficult for people to understand one another and harder to know how one feels. But a new techology called facial action coding system enables computer to identify human emotions. I think its not right to determin if someone is happy or sad by using a machine. If a simple person can't figure out what emotions someone is feeling then i dont see why they'll trust a coding system that uses 44 muscle found in your face. To see if your feeling whatever emotion your feeling based on how your muscles where being used at the time of the scanning.

For classroom use i see zero ways this can improve anything for students. Because students are emotionally unstable and there moods can switch at any given time. The artical also said something about imagine being infront of your computer and seeing an add the way you react to the add will make it so you don't see it anymore. I think its useless for a coding system to try and calculate how someone feels. The artical gives a great example

""you can tell how your friend is feeling simply by looking at there face""

this little fact made me think that both a human and computer can see your face and how both might say your sad or mad because of the way your face looks right then and there. But nether a computer nor human can trully know what that person feels inside of them.

I dont see how anyone thought this coding system could benifit anyone let alone students. this coding system that can read human emotions might be fun but serves no use for a school. it might be really good for things like seeing how kids react to new toys or cereal before you make a product go on the shelves of stores. besides that this coding system is useless in my eyes.

40D16884544D,"The most accurate way to read another ones feelings is by doing it yourself, because technology is not the most accurate way to read or feel what somone else is thinking or feeling about. Feelings can not be calculated by using technology all the time, therefore technology will never be a good way to read someones feelings or emotions. If technology is being used like it is today then there will be a point in time where humans a ruled by technology.

Technology is a good use for many things but allowing technology to read our emotions and minds is not a good source of use. If we allow technology to grow and develope by observing human behavior then isn't it possible that technology can eventually become smarter than the human mind and be able to manipulate the human kind? If this were to happen then humans can be replaced in many job fields.

In the article it states ("" Technology can read human facial expressions, if so then there would be a lot of revealed information about how many people feel about science, math,reading,history, and even their own job"").",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
61E7F7947999,"The use of facial technology in a classroom is a fantastic idea. If a teacher knows how a student is feeling maybe behavior problems could be avoided. Test scores could start to rise because if a teacher knows how you are feeling maybe they can adjust their teaching a little, so you might understand more. Just think of all the possibilities that could happen if a school used facial technology.

Students get angry throughout the day and so do teachers. If you are hiding you are not angry and then one thing tips your boat, that can cause a big scene to occur. With the new facial technology things like this could be avoided because whoever is in your classroom would know how you are feeling today. It might even be a good thing to use this technology on teachers, not just students. Teachers get angry and upset too, so using this technology could help a student know that their techer is struggling a little bit and maybe to give him or her an easier day. This could also allow the students to help better the teachers mood so things may get a little better for him or her.

Now test scores could really benefit from this new technology. If a tecaher knows when a student is bored or confused then the lesson could become modified. The teacher would know that maybe one student or even the whole class is not understanding what is being taught. The teacher could then do whatever they think is right and try and fic the lesson. At the bottom of paragraph two Dr. Huang says what I stated in the sentence above. Think about it, test scores would sky rocket if teachers knew that a student was still confused, but maybe was afriad to ask a question. If the techers also knows a student is afraid to ask a question then that could help the teacher know to maybe boost the student's cofidence more. If a teacher could find all of that out maybe he or she could simply run through the lesson again or ask the student if he or she might need a little extra help. In paragraph three is says that this technology can already identify six basic emotions and fear is one, so if more emotion are learned and recongnized then the teacher could really help solve a problem. Many possibilities could and will come with this technology.

Students could use this not only with teachers, but also with their friends. Kids tend to joke around and not realize when they are hurting someones feelings. This could allow these kids to know when too far has occured. Like almost all kids some are afraid to stand up and say that something has hurt their feelings. This new technology may help the problems with bullying. Maybe the bystanders of the bullying would see how truly upset the attacked person is feeling. Kids do a really good job at pretending things do not hurt them, but in reality they hurt them a lot. I know the article does not say anything about this but this is a huge possibility this could be used for. We want to help kids so why not do it this way.

This technology would help so much in a school. many problems occur in schools, that could potentionally be bypassed with this technology. Students and teachers could all benefit from this technology. Who is to say that if it works in a school that more advancements could come out of this new technology. We have no idea what the future holds, but this could be a big part of our future and helping us to unerstand each other a little more. ",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8

D45032FAE402,"Is the Facial Action coding system a good idea to put it in the student classroom? I think not,its not a good idea to mein 2 ways. One is because the kids might not want you to know how they feel. My second one is becuase what if a kid gets picked to be mad or sad and he gets into a fit and he gets super ticked off becuase he didn't want anyone to know. The last one is becuase that weird to be checking for the kids emotions. The first two are both similar and the third one is just plain obvious.

Yes it might work in classes like drama club, Happy day club or other clubs but other than that i dont think sobecuasei in just a regular classroom it would be weird as i say. I beleive it could also maybe work for sports but other than that i dont agree that we should have thoese emotion reader system in our classrooms. people might not want to get recognized as mad,sad,happy or even just plain or tired.

Another last reason why i dont beiieve it should be in the classrooms because just as i said in the other paragraph that peoplemight notlike it or might now want people to know how they feel becuase it might be personal. It is personal and its crossing the line. Soem people might get into a fit and that wont look pretty.

In conclution,i disagree that we should put the Facial Action Coding System in the classrooms because it wouldn't look good in the classrooms for students nor parents.            ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2

Another reason why the emothional expressions is that if they are in a play and you want they to actually feel those feelings. Plus you can tell if that person is being truthful or not.

First off the reasion you can use this technology to read emotional expressions is that Dr. Huang and his clleagus are experts that developed a new emotional - recongition software that tracks these facial movements, with characteristics movements of the facial muscules. For example is the text it states ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" This is how that computer knows how you are feeling, by look at your muscles. If they did have the emotional expressions inside of the class room then you will be able to tell if the student is telling the truth or not. By that you will know for sure of the student is lying to you or not and you'll figure out a way to punich them.

91BA3A1A794D,"In this writing prompt the topic that is going to be disscused is that if the Idea of technology going to be able to predict what humans are feeling an a emotional level.

The Idea of a facial expression reading computer is a good idea but for as long it is used for the right intentions such as using it to read picture of families to know how they are feeling, or using it for a class that is not interested into a subject so the computer alters the lesson to change up the lesson to make more entertaining for the students, but for advertisements that is not very good way to use technology in that way. If the human race is going to use technology like it should be used responsibily and used to help man kind to strive to become better.

The technology for this is remarkable and how we are going this far to use technolgy like this for only medical purposes, for learning, and to see if some one is lying or telling the truth. If it is going to be used to fill companies pockets full of cash for advertisements it shouldn't be allowed cause taking photos or using technology to invade on peoples privacy just to adjust their own benefits, and I can see it being used for purposes like art work just like the Mona Lisa .

The Facial Action Coding System(FACS) and really what makes it remarkable it tells you all of the emotions that they are feeling rather than just one specific emotion. It tells you from the emotion they feel the most to the one they feel the least about.

It is outstanding how technology could come so far in a short amount of time and their is a saying that comes with it comes great power, comes great responsibility and their is technology that is either taken for granted or it is misused for the all of the wrong reasons.

962A28D26D5E,"Over the past years technology has had many different purposes in the world, and now with the help of the softtware ""Facial Action Coding System"" teachers in classrooms will now be able to adress their student's emotions when they act out of the normal. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto it shows many examples regarding this topic. Because of the student's lack of expressing their emotions verbally, this computer software must be used to reveal what is happening within their heads.

In order to know what a student's mind wants to be happy and not bored, the teachers must use this software because a person cannot always comprehend facial features. In the aricle it talks about how many emotions showed by making facial expressions are not always comprehendable. According to the author, in paragraph 4 it states ""'The facial expressions for each emotion are universal'"" (D'Alto 4). The term ""universal"" as it is being used in the sentence shows just the magnitude of how much a face can express. If teachers don't use this software, school might just remain boring to students without the teachers knowing.

Even though some people would agree that it is an invasion to privacy to use this in classrooms, the software would be for the good of the lack of communication between the teacher and students. The software would also improve the overall performance of the students during class, since now the teacher would know what to do when the class is bored or happy. In the article it also enhances the facts of nonverbal communication by stating ""'Most human communiction is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Huang"" (D'Alto 6). If emotions and communications are nonverbal, why not use technology to unravel the thoughts of a student. No teacher would want their students to feel negative feelings towards their classes, so here is an opportunity to make school better for both students and teachers.

Students may have to be provoked so they can show what they are feeling, however; the teachers making their students show emotion will help them be happier while being in the classroom. Students who do not want to be in school must be adressed first so they are better of in the future. This statement is supported by looking in the article where the author states ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, butr also may even help produce them"" (D'Alto 9). Teacher making their students ""break a smile"" would aid their bordem into becoming a happier and more positive emotion.

Thus, the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is positive, because of the help it would provide on the student's perspective of school. Less students would drop out and more students would go to school and learn just because of the enviroment that the computer software helps evoke.

Other reasons why i think the Facial Coding System should know our emotions because when they ask a question i feel that you should show emotion in the question they ask like things like why you feel that way , when you felt that way , & when will you change your feeling about the way you feel .

4E69F31CDBDF,"The use of the Facial Action Coding System that is used to read emotional expressions of students in classrooms is valuable. The use of this technology is valuable because students would have a better work ethic. The students would want to strive and would want to do their work.

This technology could help make a better work ethic in students because the computer would know how to keep their attention. For example, say that a student is doing a work activity on the computer but starts lacking interest in the activity. The computer could read the students emotional expressions and make the activity more interesting, like using more colors, or even adding more to the activity that is fun. The computer could do something that excited the student or even made the student want more of something, such as information about a topic they read about.

In the article, the author states that the professor, Dr. Huang, tested the emotion software on the famous Mona Lisa painting. The software collected data that Mona Lisa was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. With that information being collected from this software I believe that its use could be valuable with classroom computers. The teachers would value the work of the software to know how to help the students when the lack work ethic and to know how to keep the childs attention to the work. This software could even help the teachers work ethic by getting to know how their students learn.

The Facial Action Coding System could be the future to a new software in all computers when it comes to all types of schooling systems, no matter if its medical school or even high school. The way that the software calculates emotions is very interesting to me. This software was a great project to complete. In my opinion, this could be very valuable to schools all over. This could also be valuable to the students and teachers using it to work.

Its amazing how a software program can track facial movements to decet emotions. The software uses video imagery, which then tracks the facial movements of a person, which then detects the emotions of the person. This somewhat mimics the way that humans can detect emotions.

Even though the computers could tell you how another person is feeling you could also do the same with your closest frineds and family because you kmow them so well. The computers have no idea who you are but they still know what emotion you are feeling just by how the bones in your face are working together.

The computer will form a 3-D model of the face. All of the 44 major muscles have to work exactly like the human muscles in the model. They have classified six basic emotions such as: happiness, surprise, disgust, anger, sadness, and fear. Most people like to hide their emotions with thier face so people don't know that something is wrong. The computer could see right through that and see exactly what emotion is going on.

In the classroom students that are shy or don't ask for help often lie to their teacher and tell them that they understand exactly whats goingon and exactly what they're doing. If we had those computers in the classrooms then the teachers could help us more by knowing the truth. The teachers could figure out a better way to teach the lesson so the kids are'nt so confused.

These computers could change lives but not many people probably see that since it's just another piece of technology. Imagine using this for someone yu are teaching or explaining something to yoou would want them to learn whatever that is you're helping them with would'nt you? But if that person is scared or shy they wouldn't be so easy to tell you that they don't understand. If we used these computers properly and not just as some toy then we could change how education is taught and it not being so difficult to understand so you could recieve better education quality.

Teachers already try their best to help their students but sometimes it's just more difficult than it seems. Children like to give attitude when not understanding something or when they feel like the teacher is judging them because they don't understand something. When it comes to school and work it's alot of stress and focusing but if teachers had a better way to recognize the emotions of their students it'd be easier for them to help them out instead of leaving them there and not understand anything.

I feel as if teachers would like the idea of having one of these computers in their classroom because not only does it benefit their students but it also benefits them by helping their generation out and not letting their students fail but to become successful. So I think that having these in the classroom would be very valuable and helpful for everyone. ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

Technology that can recognize emotions in a class room could be used to help students who are bored or confused. The ability to tell when someone is bored or lost is a very valuable tool for a teacher. This would change everything about how we learn. That is the problem. We could change a system that has put people on the moon.

The school system we have right now works to educate people very well. Changing our system in such an extreme manor would have equally extreme consequences. We may fail to educate the generation this is tried on, or we may fail to make people as strong as they are now.

Another problem is privacy. This technology would take away any hope of hiding ones feelings. If I am angry at a classmate and this technology tells the teacher, then everyone could be forced into a situation no one wants to be in. We have the freedom of speech and the right to remain silent. This technology would force us to share more than we might want. This could destroy relationships within schools hamper eduaction.

Another factor that must be considered is cost. How much would it be for one student to have one? Howmuch for all the students? Many schools struggle to provide learning materials and having risky technology that costs so much could limit a tight budget even more.

93B9B1911285,"Learning and curiosity are what keep the human race moving foward and contiually evolving. Through this, humans created the ultimate technology, the computer. Computers help with almost everything humans do in their lives, and now there is technology that can decipher the most untouched part of humans, emotions. The technology called FACS (Facial Action Cofing System), can figure out what a person is feeling and do many things with that information. This technology would be valuble because it would help inmprove the quality of learning in the classroom. I believe this because it can help bring back the attention of bored students, figure out problems with students, and figure out the most beneficial way for each student to learn.

First of all, this technology could keep students engaged in their learning experience. Most students drift off during class because the material they are being taught isn't being taught in an interesting way. In paragraph 6, the text states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts."" This shows that a computer could easily recognize when a student becomes uninterested in the lesson they're being taught and what that lesson is about. Being able to discover when a student has become disengaged with their learning could help teachers turn the attention of that student back to what they were supposed to be learning.

Another reason allowing this technology to read student's emotions would be beneficial is because computers would be able to understand more than just verbal human communitation. According the the text, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication.'"" Computers are so ingraned in daily life that almost everything that people do involves some type of technology. If they were able to read the emotions of students, teachers could catch problems before they even happened. For example, if a student was becoming depressed, they might not reach out to anyone for help, but a computer could recognize the constant sadness on the students face and contact someone who could help resolve the situation. That is just part of the reason that this technology, which could read students emotions, is extremely valuble.

Finally, this technology could be helpful in the classroom by learning, by it's self, the specialized interests of each specific student. If a student was more interested in one learning style than another, the computer could recognize the facial cues of the student and ajust properly. The text states, ""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar as might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" That could be easily modified to fit into the classroom. Instead of ads, the computer could display a certain type of learning, such as flashcards. If the student enjoyed using flashcards, then the computer could remember that and display flashcards as the initial method of learning in the future. However, if another student was shown flashcards as a learning method and the computer recognized facial cues that showed dislike or disinterest, it could change the learning method to something else, like matching. By reading the emotions of students in the classroom, a computer could figure out the most beneficial way for a student to learn.

In conclusion, this technology has so many potential benefits if it were to be used in the classroom. It can help bring back the attention of bored students, figure out problems with students, and figure out the most beneficial way for each student to learn. Teachers would finally be able to get students interested in learning again instead of having kids dread waking up in the morning because it's time for another day of the same old thing.

F9FFECDE9A53,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify humans emotions to see humans' reactions while they are using their computers. Computers can recognize emotions by the way you look, and it is allow to the computers to understand your feelings, and to change the topic because they used this technology to see Mona Lisa's emotions. ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model on the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" When technology developed they started their project with a 3-D computer.

A claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions are that the computer can detected the emotions of the student because it has a ""Web ad appears"" on the screen of the student's computer, and it can see his/her different emotions by the way their faces are.

According to the text in paragraph 6 Dr. Huang explains how the computer might work if the student doesn't like what he/she has in the computer and it says ""A classrom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers can understand that, too."" It means that technology has developed, Dr. Paul Eckman and Dr. Huang created the FACS to see humans emotions, it has six basic as: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. The Doctors are showing that the new computers can see what it is in your mind because they improved the technology.

My conclusion is that the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a good appications for a variety of industries because it is able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they try to hide their emotions. The new technology has ""Empathy because it can feels someone else's emotions and can handle the complex algorithms. ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
2D95CCCD4DC0,"I am totally against the value of using to read students emotionals. I feel like technology isn't always one hindred percent right and makes lots of mistakes and errors. Just because you come up with system (FACS) that has all 44 major muscles humans have, does not mean it's going to be right every single time.

Technology is taking over the world and i understand that, but i feel as technology should not get involved with the human features. Reading students emotional expressions in the classroom is not valuable. This system could give teachers the wrong impressions on how their students are thinking or feeling. For example a student in your class could be very sickand look sad because their not feeling good. You as the teacher might think that he/she is sad because of some other reason such as a personal reason.

FACS is not needed in classrooms. this system has a 50/50 chance of being right on its ""guessing"". Some people might think this would be perfect for teachers in all reality, teachers for the must part can see when a student is struggling, and would not need this system. We are all humans with feelings and we all deserve to have some type of privacy. What if a student doesn't want anybody to know that they just lost a loved one. I just think that if we don't want anybody to know what we are feeling, our teachers shouldn't be able to figure it out.

The Facial Action Coding System is valuable in the classroom because there are students who fake a smile when they're sad or troubled. Some students want help but they don't want to bother people with their problems so they stay quiet and fake a smile. With FACS the teachers and students will be able to tell the student's emotions and they can help the student.

It is also helpful because it can tell when a student is bored. When a student is bored, he/she will most likely not pay attention. But with FACS teachers will be able to tell when the student is bored so they can make learning a little fun. That way students will be able to pay attention and get educated.

Also, FACS can tell when the student is scared. The students might be going through something and they're scared of someone or something but some students don't know how to tell. They could be threatened by someone. FACS will be able to tell when the student is scared so the teachers and students can finally help the student who is scared.

Some people would argue that it is not a good idea beacuse what if some students dont want the computer to tell waht ther felling, they would think it was a little weird. I think that it would be a good idea here is why.

I think it would be a good I dead for computers to read students emotional expressions. I think this because say if somebody is falling be hind in class and the computer can tell. The computer could change the chapter or less he or she is confused with so they could understand it better. The student would no longer be confused and could catch up.

Some people would say that what if the computer thinks the kid doesn't under stand the material that he or she is learning. The computer would change the lesson up a little bit so they could understand it better, but in the long run doesn't. In that case the computer would make it harder for that paiticular student to learn the material given to them.

Some stundents would like it because it would help them ina way that makes them understand the lesson or chapter better witch also would help there grade. If I had the chance to use this technology I would.

Sometimes I am a little lost or cunfused and if you dont get that lesson you could fall farther and aferther in the hole. and never catch up. Whith this technology u would nerver fall behind.

With all the infomation we have the technology could ether help out a student or make them fall behind. The information we have concluds that we would still be etter of we the technology.

68B6142F4EA9,"The use of this advanced technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable from three reasons in the article that the author tells us by reading this article.

It's interesting to think ahead and create something big that no one can do. In paragraph 3, the author says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" The 44 muscles can tell how the human is feeling, by seeing how the person is moving. For example, when the person is moving really fast, it means that the person might be angry or aggressive. But when a person is moving slow, it means that the person is sad or depressed.

The author tells in the text, ""We humans perform this same impressive calculation every day."" But comparing a human mind to a computer is different. A human mind can think that the friend is feeling sad, but the computer can have more than just one idea of how the friend feels. The computer can have more than one idea by scanning the face of the person and calculating how the muscles of the face look. It may seem amazing to try to use the technology.

From the picture of Mona Lisa, when you just look at it, many ideas would pop up in your head from trying to guess how she's feeling and how she looks. There would be multiple guesses on how her face looks. In paragraph 6, the author says, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."" Some people might say that she looks mostly happy, a bit disgusted, somewhat fearful, and a little angry. Or they might say all of them and more. We all have different minds, different thoughts, and a different sights at describing a picture.

Moreover, the article gives us a lot of information of the advanced technological computer that constructs a 3-D model, to scan a human face and tell how the person feels emotionally. It's amazing and interesting to even read about Dr. Huang and Prof. Sebe ,his colleague, are both experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
3980928115FF,"In the article, ""Making Mona Lsia Smile,"" written by Nick D'Alto, there is a new technology being introduced to the world called the Facial Action Coding system, otherwise known as ""FACS"". Essentially, this technology allows people to calculate the exact percentage of the emotions presented in one's facial expression by studying the placement of there facial muscles. The machine analyzes your face in search of six particular emotions, sadness, anger, surprise, happiness, fear, and disgust.

Now with the availability of a technology such as this schools are suggesting that the ""FACS"" machine should be placed in classrooms. Although, Many people believe the tool is invasive, there are many reasons that prove a system like this in the classroom can be very useful.

All in all, the amount of time and effort that it would take to take a simple scan is a trivial expense to the reults you can get from it. The main reason is revealed in paragraph 6, the author explains, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", this qouted by Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institutefor Advanced Science. He explains that this device could help teachers better their educational skills in the classroom. When the technology fully analyzes the emotions of a student it is a way of giving feedback to teachers regarding the way a lesson beign taught is received.

In concluson, The ""FACS"" technology is a helpful sourece in the classroom because it is a way to better connect the faculty and the students without presenting any conflicts. This technology will also further the effectivity of a child's education.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
EE003057790E,"While technolgy is being developed as time goes by, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", is when technology wasn't good and for that, no one couldn't tell what she's feeling before FACS (facial action coding system) revealed her hidden feelings. Having a technology that can read expressions is valuable and should be allowed. There aren't many affects to it and it would help many people to express or show at least a sign or a feeling.

before feelings were being revealed and shown by a machine, people we're already talented and smart enough to tell one another faces. In the article, the author told us that it's not hard to tell when someone is either sad or happy, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" this quote provides us information that looking at someone's face can give us a lot of hints, even if they try to aviod it or show it. which means it is natural for somone to know notice it while some can't. Another thing that the author tells us is that the muscles are visible and that there's nothing to hid when parts of our faces gives the viewer an opourtunity to either guess or say what they see, "" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" this quote perfectly explains that there are many majors and units where it deals with the muscles and movement in our bodiues. It's easy to tell with or without parts of the face showing.

Lastly, the machine. As technology increases, a machine called Facial Action Coding System, solved it better than using our proper eyes. Dr. Paul Eckman, who combined his thoughts to create the machine, and Dr. Huang, who helped Dr. Paul Eckman build the machine, helped themselves and others to know the hidden feelings of Mona Lisa and sooner will be used on others. In the article, it talks about how Da vinci made Mona Lisa look different while he was drawing/painting her, "" Yet Dr. Huang observes that the artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions."" this quote means that Da Vinci was smart enough to switch up on the painting and made it seem so realistic and looked like she's going through a lot.

While the readers recieve a lot of information about the technology and how it works, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", was more of a for than against. There's nothing wrong using it while its helping scientist know what's going on inside a person's mind. Not enough of against dosen't mean this article is not helpful, it can still be helpful and especially for those who are for it.

Yes this way of using FACS is a little creepy and it may be a violtinon of our right but really we have no right till about 21 years of age.

9DB0CD72C72A,"Many times during online activites, students can become confused or just simply bored. They often need their teacher to come and explain the topic to them because the online course or activity just simply isn't helping them in a way that works for them. The Facial Action Coding System would be beneficial to both the students and the teachers in schools. This technology can enable online programs to be modified to the students needs, whether they're lost or just uninterested, and it can help the children more efficiently when the teacher has their hands full. The Facial Action Coding System would be an overall help to struggling students and teachers everywhere.

Bored students are never a good thing. No student looks at a boring assignment and thinks, ""Wow, I really want to do this assignment for the next hour."" A bored student leads to an unmotivated student who isn't trying very hard, and there is nothing more boring than staring at a screen for some period of time doing homework. In the sixth paragraph of the article it states that this technology could recognize when a student is becoming bored and modify the lesson like a real human instructor. This could keep students engaged and interested in the lesson. They would be more willing to complpete their work than if the lesson were monotonous. The Facial Action Coding System could eliminate bored students everywhere.

Teachers in public schools can have up to 40 students in one class and they can't help all of them at once. Teachers are human, they can't be in two places at once or helping two students at once. With the Facial Action Coding System, computers can modify their lesson and teaching to specific students and give them the help that they need to understand the standards. All students don't learn the same way and all teachers cannot possibly have time to help each and every one of their students individually. This technology can make studies a little bit easier for everyone, even the adults.

This technology would be very valuable in schools, especially in the times we're currently living in. Almost everything is online nowadays. Classes that taught how to write in cursive are being replaced with classes that teach how to type correctly on a keyboard. In many schools you will find children carrying around laptops instead of textbooks. You can even take college courses online. Why wouldn't you want to make the online learning experience even better by allowing the computers to customize themselves to the specific student?

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would vastly improve the educational experience of students all around the world. If a student were confused or bored, the computer would adjust itself to keep the student understanding and engaged in the lesson. The computers would be able to provide just as good of help as the teacher would, thereby lessening the workload of the teacher and making sure the students are still getting all the explanations and teaching they need.

A software that can identify human emotions can be a great thing but would using this in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of students be worth it. This software can be used for many different and great things. This software can identify mixed emotions which could be helpful for people that work in a career that deals with other people all day.

The idea of using this in computer software in classrooms is a bad idea because teachers usually can tell how a student is feeling by the way they are acting in class or even if they just look at the student. High School students usually tell give off the feeling that they don't want to be there. Plus it says in the article that ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This means that a schools would most likely spend a lot of money on computers that can run this software for in-class use.

This technology could be useful because in paragraph six it states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This proves a good point but at the same time it doesn't because yes students do get bored or confused frequently, but modifying the lesson for one or two students is not worth the technology. Teachers can try to help the student or students that are confused with the lesson they are given. Teachers could also try to learn the simple instructions that ""encode"" different emotions to use in the classroom.

In conclusion, using this technology would be a waste of the state's and school's money to purchase computers that could run this technology in class.

While reading this article I found lots of good things about this computer, such as how if a teacher had one they could find out if their students are liking the lesson or just not wanting to listen at all. In the next paragraphs I will explain how the use of this technology is a good idea.

My evidence to supprt my claim is in paragraph six it says,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" I choose to use this evidence, because alot of teachers don't know if their lesson or what they are teaching is actually going to be a sucess or if the students are just acting like they are listening. At my school, alot of students don't listen to the teache teach. This new technology could detect if the students are confused or just plan old bored, and this could allow the teachers to maybe change the way they are teaching the lesson, maybe make it more interative.

The other evidence I found to support my claim is in the fourth paragraph where is says,""By weighting the the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."" With this technology, it could help doctor, nurses, theraphist, and even school counselors, to see the real emotion that their patients are feeling at a certain time. I know that alot of patients at a doctors office like to hide what they are feeling so that they look tough, well with this type of technology any person that has a patient of some sort will be able to know the emotion they are feeling so they know what they could give them the help that they need. This might be the only use for this technology, but the help it could give to the people who are hurting, upset or have any other emotion, this new technology could help all them.

In conclusion, to my claim I think that this technology will be very useful to alot of people who like to hid their emotion instead of sharing it with the people they should really be sharing it with.

Then it gets into Facial Expressions that could be recognized. In this paragraph it said ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeeling simply by the look on their face"".

This would help many students understand the concept and test scores would be so much higher.

According to the article people are able to tell if you are having a bad day. People can not tell what is wrong with you just because you look sad or upset.

For example if you're feeling sad and your friend tells a funny joke you can fake a smile your friends won't even relize your faking a smile. Also a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, he had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowing (what a great way to practice) as a way of creating these emotions on stage and i think that's a really great way to practice because if they go up on stage and don't know how to do a really great emotion their drama teacher might get angry.

Classrooms are a notorius place for students to fall asleep to the sounds of their teacher or to easily get off task and the teacher may not even know, but with the Facial Action Coding System, it could read the students emotions to see if they're up to date with whats going on in class, you could see if any of them are bored, or .distracted, this helps the lesson planner by planning more accordingly based on independent classroom statistics. Thus, classrooms are a good place for children to be, but they would be better off if they had fun while they had schools as well, this gives them the idea that school is fun and they should give it another shot.

The Facial Action Coding System is a software program that follows intense algorithums that allow it to the the amazing act of reading other emotions, this is very helpful in todays thoughts, it can be used by law enforcement and schools in America.

If a student if going through something mentally the software can ""indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forces one."" If the computer is showing that a student is showing a lot of sad or forced facial expressions then it could notify the teacher. Then the teacher could try to help that student with whatever it is that might be troubling them.

Adding FACS to school settings would help teachers teach at the right pace, keep students on task, even help students become smarter. By reading a students emotions the teachers can help in so many ways. Schools should look into adding a system like FACS into classrooms.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

An example from the article is "" we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on there faces"" Another thing why I think this type of technology is going to be useful, Is because maybe in the future all of the work could be handed over to the technology, Letting the technology do the work for us, Which would make it much easier for humans and less stressful to think about.

If the computer can read our face expression to see that we are bored and change what's on the screen to something more appealing, then maybe it would brighten the mood.

There's no doubt that most students don't like school and fine it incredibly boring. Working on the computers brings a sort of excitement because we prefer technology over standard teachings. Personally, I would prefer to sit on the computer, like I am now, and learn and do assignments. In fact, I'd rather be able to sit at home and work on school work and be able to take breaks whenever I feel like it.

School is like work, I hate it. if this FACS technology can brighten things up at school, then just maybe it wouldn't be so boring. Maybe I wouldn't mind getting up at 6:30 every morning to get ready and go somewhere I don't even want to go. I would love for a computer to read my facial expressions and change what's on the screen to something more suitable for me.

Like I said before, it's no surprise that the majority of students do not like school. This FACS technology could really have a bright future. If it all goes well then it just might make school a place where children and young adults would actually look forward to going to.               ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

Well what it does and how it can be helpful, useful and then it can solv a lot of mystreys in some cases. If somebody can tell what feelings there exspressing can be helpful in a way by telling somebody like a doctors that studys people when there just angry, sad or happy. And that tecnology can help when others are in a certain state of depresion and that certain somebody doesent want to be noticed that machine can help with a person they may commit suicide. When no one knows it but the machiene can tell if there just trying to put on a good face over a really bad time. So then how can it be useful it will also sovle some unusal cases like some artisis make and no one will ever understand what they were trying to go for inside the person. Like the Mona Lisa some people will probably never understand what if just is smiling or grining for the picture. If this invention coms out permanatly that it can show a poll of how kids view homework and then show how some people view work places. If they are dicustuing or just p a place you dont want to goto. Then it also solves the basic stuff like make face detecting how people fell about some presidents andit can solve cases if a person was happy or he was mad to tell if a person was a killer or not.

Technology is a good source for reading students' emotions.

Technology could help an individual see what another individual is feeling. In the text it states that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" that's what the Facial Action Coding system is there for. If someone can't tell how their peer is feeling, they should use this technology. Computers are smart. Technology can tell how you're feeling.

If a student is not in the best mood, a peer or a teacher can help them with what they're going through. ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face,"" humans can't tell what people are going through that wears a neutral face. The Facial Action Coding System reads all of your face muscles and movements. ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar add might follow,"" this tells the audience that computers can tell how you're feeling.

CDAC4415A79F,"The Mona Lisa is one of the greatest pieces of artwork Da Vinci has ever created. It shows great craftmanship and 83% happiness within her smile, according to a new face recognition software created Professor Huang from the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science, and Professor Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. It creates and analyzes a 3-D face to assume what the person is feeling. This could also help students in other ways, by scanning their faces and trying to help them if a problem seems confusing or difficult, but this would give them less privacy and less security. This new system may not even be accurate, in which if they analzyes and assumed wrong for the painting, then the students' expression would also be wrong, making this system completely false and unusable in any way.

First off, a painting is different than a person. You can't accurately assume what the expression is if a person painted it. The facial structure would be slighly different from the actual person, because there is no way to completely recreate a face, especially back when it was painted. It may be very similiar to the person, but it is not the same person, meaning that the software has incorrectly given this person inaccurate or false emotion in which they previously did not have.

If this software doesn't give the correct answers to a painting, then we can assume it wouldn't work a human. Humans can show more visual expression than the software can detect. There is no setting for nervousness or joy. If someone was crying tears of joy, the computer would see this differently, and say this person would be very sad instead of being joyful. Humans can also fake expressions. If someone was sad, but had a smile the entire day, the computer might sense some sadness, but not nearly enough to show they are truly sad and that the student shows more happiness than sadness as the time of scanning them.

Lastly, even if this went into effect, this is giving students almost no privacy or security when using a computer. Sure its helpful for learning in some ways, but they have to give the software new emotions like confusion. Even if the expression showing confusion is implemented, this doesn't mean its safe. From paragraph 6, it states: ""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"". Why does this matter? This just gives more excuses on how student's privacy is being exploited. It's also quite useless. You could be thinking of something else besides the ad, but the computer would see that your expression is happy, so you would get a similar ad, which you may not enjoy at all. It just doesn't make any sense to put it in a computer.

This new software is a great concept and could used in many different ways that would be very helpful, but it doesn't seem advanced enough to be put inside lots of computers yet. It's also quite dangerous, since the computer is looking at everything you are doing, inside and now outside the computer even more closely.

Bringing this kind of technology into your lives could seriously damage your reputation, social life, or anything of the like if your computer got hacked. If the software is inaccurate, then when you want to use this feature on a computer, it would be wrong, making this a faulty piece of software, unable to accurately give the emotion you were hoping to give. This could lead to many problems in the future if this face recogniztion software is used in the future. It's just not good enough to be used in the real world yet. Maybe after some time, but as it is not, it's not ready. ",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8
AD1C015DFBCD,"Emotions can reveal a lot about what is going through someone's mind. When a person is wearing a neutral face on, it is hard to tell what emotion they are feeling. Now there is technology to help decipher what that perosn is feeling. Dr. Paul Eckman has created a process when a computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face to tell what emotion is on it, Facial Action Coding System or FACS.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'alto, the use of Facial Action Coding Sytem (FACS) to read the emotional expressions of students is valuable education wise and emotionally.

Knowing a student does not understand or is uninterested in a topic can help teachers in a tremendous way. If there is

""a classroom computer that could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson"" (D'alto). By modifying the lesson, the teacher will make a change to the lesson. After changing the lesson to an easier way for some students to understand, it can help the students grades. When a student is bored of the topic, the teacher can fix the lesson to be more interesting.

Not only will education be better for students, but emtionally they will feel a lot better. Dr. Eckman designs his system with the basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness (D'alto). In classrooms, students may show emotions other than being bored or confused, but show something is wrong with them. Teachers can be notified that a student may seem troubled and can assist emotional support. Humans can tell when their friends are feeling by just giving a glance, but some may have trouble telling what emotion the other person is feeling (D'alto). With a new computer software that stores similar anatomical information as electronic code, created by Dr. Huang, a classroom computer is able to tell what emotion a student is feeling (D'alto). Teachers may not be close with some students, so they are unable to tell what the stduent is feeling. However, the computer can signal that a student is feeling a certain way to the teacher.

Students can excel education wise and emotionally due to the use of technology to read their emotional expressions in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"".

I am doing bad other kids might be doing bad as well. In class computers should be able to use the Facial Action Coding System to alter things to our knowledge if we get confused on a problem, bored, or distracted.

One way computers can use the FAC System is recognizing when we get confused on a test question. When we get confused instead of asking for help from the teacher the computer can take us through steps to solve the problem and then gives us a new problem so we can do what we just reviewd ourselves. The text also gives us a similar way, in the text it says that the computer can tell when we get confused or bored and modify the test or lesson to make it easier.

Another way the FAC System could be useful is if we get bored during a test or lesson. If we get bored during a trest or lession that computer will recognise that and then taylor the losson so it can be less boring and more fun.

The last way that the FAC system can be useful in schools is if we get distracted. If we get distracted by something while taking a test or doing a lesson of some sort the computer could be able to recognise that and give us some sort of brain break to help give our minds a break to think before getting back into the lesson. This can be helpful in many ways because sometimes if you are distracted by sonmething you are not going to give other work your best effort.

965455C37529,"Facial Action Coding System is a new improved software system for find out people emotions and feelings just by their facial expressions. The Reason using tehnology to read students emotional expressions is valuable is because better way of getting close and personal with people, the improved way of helping people with their problems, and just by looking at a picture or word, we can make ourselfs feel that emotion. Those three exaples are ways that this system is valuable.

One reason the system is valuable is because it is a better way of getting to know people. In the story, the author explains how Mona Lisa has different emotions in the famous picture that was made from Leonardo de Vinci. ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent dearful, and 2 percent angry"". Thinking the only way possible to find out is to ask Leonardo. Well, there is a ""new software system has been developed that improves acuracy in perceiving the emotions of others"". This quote explains how through one scan on the computer, we can find out how they are feeling. This software system is a better way of getting to know eachother, but also it is a better way of helping people through their problems.

Also, a reason this system is valuable is because it is i proved system to help us help other people through their problems. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeoing simply by the look on her face."" That quote explains how facial expressions help. People can only tell if their happy, sad, mad, etc. Just mainly the basics. But with this system, you can tell how they are really feeling and be very specific. Just by raising your eyebrows, it'll tell you are curious. Or just by squinting your eyes when your smiling, the system can tell you are happy. For a computer, that is pretty impressive. Not only you can tell their problems, but it explains how looking at different emotions make you feel the same as them.

One last reason this system is valuable is because by us just looking at picture or a word, we can make ourselfs feel that emotion. ""Empthy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions"". That quote explains how just by looking at a person, screem, picture, etc. we can feel the same exact emotion just because how normal and easy it is these days.

Technolgy has changed many ways over the passed years. Theere was internet coming out, then touch screen, many websites and video calling apps, etc. But now all the way to the fact we can express and know eachothers emotions by just one scan on the computer. A better way of getting close and personal with people, the improved way of helping people with their problems, and just by looking at a picture or word, we can make ourselfs feel that emotion is the reason using technology is valuable.

C16F3B6AAEC2,"Peoples emotions can be hard to detect most times. Personally, my friends have gotten very good at faking emotions. Detecting how someone really feels in nearly impossible for the human brain. For example, in the article it states that the Mona Lisa is, ""83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry."" Being able to detect all of those emotions in just looking or talking to someone just isn't as easy as it seems. Thats why they came up with ""the Facial Action Coding System."" This system has been developed to improve the accuracy in perceiving ones emotions.

Frst, the way this system will work is when the computer constructs a 3-D compter model of a face. The computer will be able to detect the emotion of a person when they see the muscles in their face. To be able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom will be very benificiary when it comes to how they feel about the thing the school is teaching them. If we continue to advance in technology like we have, then using the computers for lessons will be able to detect weather the child is interested or not. The article states that, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becomming confused or bored."" That way when a child is confused, for those who are too scared to ask for help, the teacher could be alerted and try their best to help the child or maybe even change lessons.

Secondly, the computer system could also be very helpful in a school because of teenage kids and their problems. If a student is feeling very down, then the computer could detect that and try to get help for them. In the world today there are many kids who suffer from depression and anxiety, sometimes school can be too much for them. Therefore, when doing school work if the computer can detect the sadness or overwhelming confusion causing their anxiety to rise it could help them out a lot. The article states that, ""In the real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth, while a fake smile the mouth is stretched sideways, using zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" This would help the computer detect kids from being actually happy, or just faking it for everyone else.

Third, the computer system could help with kids who struggle with anger. Maybe school makes them angry, or they struggle with the work. With the school fights in the past, and future, i belive this would help detect how kids feel. The computer could watch what the child proceeds to look up on the internet, while also detecting how the child feels. This way, if a child shows signs of harm to themselves or to others, the computer could inform the school and try to give help to the kid. I believe this would only improve the safety of schools while also offering help to the ones that need it.

Fourth, I believe the computer system could help those of us who tend to get very bored or tired. This way when a child is bored or tired the teacher has a way of fixing the problems, or doing more interesting ideas to help you stay focused. Personally, i tend to get very bored when school comes up to topic, so if my teacher had a way of making it interesting for me that would be awesome! I also tend to get very tired so if my teacher is alerted of a child getting sleepy, we could do exercise or stretches to help wake us up.

This computer system would help school coorporations tremendlously because of all the problems kids go through. I believe that every school computer should have this sytem, because i think the techers could have a chance to keep children interested and awake. This could possibly improve attendance and graduation percetages. Getting a kid engaged and interested can be very difficult but i belive this stystem would help a lot!

To begin with, You wake up for school and your mom is already making breakfast for you, but you dont know how she was feeling. When you come in the room she would erase ""that"" expression and greet you with a smile like usual. Didnt you wish you could tell how she was feeling and do something to make her feel better? With the FACS you can. 60 percent tired, 25 percent happy, 10 percent sad, and 5 percent angry. So you hug her and tell her to go back to sleep, then you go to school.

In the meantime, you arrive at school and meet up with your friends, but you could tell that one of them isnt as ""energized"" as usual. You would ask them whats wrong and they would probably say ""nothing"" and force a smile. You know that they arent feeling great but you dont want to nag them as well. So then you would use FACS. 90 percent depressed, 2 percent happy, 5 percent tired, and 3 percent angry. You can then calculate that they are depressed because of family problem or school.

Last but not least, according to the article ""we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". Using the technology of FACS can help you ""calculate"" your friend or parent feeling.

576DED0D725D,"The Mona Lisa is a very iconic painting by Leonardo Da Vinci; however, no one pays attention to how her smile was constructed. According to the new computer software, Facial Action Coding System or FACS, she's 83 percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful and two percent angry. This software is very useful and can help push technology ahead.

The process begins with a computer constructing a 3-D model of the face and all 44 major muscles must move like a human face. These movements are called action units. Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS, classified the six basic emotions of facial expressions; happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, disgust, and fear, and implied them to facial muscles. The software can even track mixed emotions. For example, the Mona Lisa as she has four different emotions in her picture.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is intended to bring a smile to people's faces., while it shows just how much a computer can do. Dr. Huang predicts, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". He continues to go on about how it could modify a lesson like a human instructor. This can be very useful for children and teenagers who are homeschooled and take online courses. The same technology can make computer-animated faced more expressive for video games or surgery.

This FACS machine isnt very necessary for daily life, but can help in the classroom. It is very cool and interesting, and can help teachers know when students are struggling. This software is going to help humans in the future and will only become more advanced. Dr. Huang notes, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". He is correct with that statement.

In conclusion, Dr. Huang and his colleague did a terrific job in creating such an advanced piece of technology. This will help teachers and schools in the future.

The use of such technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom may change how the school ciriculum leading to missing lessons, risk of teachers losing thier jobs, and how high the price of such technology is.

If the student does not like the lesson, the computer program may inform the teacher, This may lead to the school board taking out important lessons that will help the student later in life. But, how are they supposed to teach if the student does not like the lesson? If per say, the student finds nothing of the lesson interesting, the student will most likely learn nothing. That leads to the student not being as succesful in the future merely because they not learn the key lessons due to the fact that they thought it was ""boring"". If the computer does end up changing the way the student is taught, then the student will most likely get the idea that in life things will be altered to fit thier ends and desires. When inreality, that is not how life works. The student will be ""sugar-coated"" with all these advantages and have a change in character.

Not only does it put the risk of the student's future at risk but also the jobs of the teachers. If the computer alters the teaching is done then how will they know when to help the student? The computer program will eventually become the teacher putting the teacher out of a job. As if we already do not have high unemployment rates.

In the article, Dr. Huang predicts that ""Then it could motify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""(Par. 6). Dr. Huang gives off the idea that the teacher will no longer be a human but rather a computer. Sure it may alter the lesson, but if that teacher put a big amount of time into that lesson only for it to be change, then what is the point?

Lastly, the whole cost of installing face-reading technology can come at a big price. Many schools do not have that kind of money in thier funding. I know that my school most definitely does not have the money to supply all the computers and laptops with this type of technology. Not even a students PC at home can ""handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile. But we can write down some simple instructions that ""encode"" different emotions.""(Par. 7). So basically not only would the school board spen lots of monety on installing the technology but also buy new computers that can handle such algorithms. Including the student , in order to get taught at thier pace and style would have to spend a lot of money on this technology.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts.(6) I personaly would like a teacher that knows when I need help or when I know what Im doing. Its even better if they know when we are bored, it could change lots of students mind sets towards public education.

The FACS could help in many ways, one it could be helpful towards actors or just people that want to be more in touch with there emotions. ""According to the Facial Feedback Thoery of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" (9) When you sign up for a class that you have to act in and your grade depends on it, this machine would come real handy. I was in a speech class my first semester of 10th grade. The teacher made us memorize a monolge of a movie character. We had to say word for word while showing emotions, emotions that I had never felt before. With the FACS future students could be better at that class and it can go a long way.

The Facial Action Coding System does help students in the classroom. It would be a whole new genaration of studnets if this machine went out to the schools. When students dont have to wait on real teachers to move on or help them with something they are stuck on, the makeup of theyre brain will totally change for the better. Students will be faster at thinking, solving and much more during school.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
5C75990D9E18,"The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. Some people say that we should have facial recognition in the computers in schools so that if the student looks bored or confused, the computer will change it up a little bit for their liking. It will also be able to help teachers know when a student needs assistance or needs a more energizing lesson. Using this technology in classrooms is valuable because it will help teachers change their actions and might help the student become more engaged.

Schools all over the world would really benefit from the Facial Action Coding System. By using this, there could be a possibility of more engaged students and finally result in higher test scores. Dr. Huang says,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Not only will teachers result from this, but students will as well. Just by using the computer system, we will be able to tell how a student is feeling in that classroom or during a certain lesson. If we could see the facial expression, be able to figure out why, and change something to fix it, that would be very effective in the school setting.

Although this would be really great, many people could say that not all students have the same feelings about things so if a teacher changed his or her lesson based on one student, then some of the other students might not be as engaged or delighted. It wouldn't be right to do something based on one student rather than twenty-five. If a few students are very engaged in this lesson and they are paying attention and getting something out of it but other students are confused, if the teacher decides to make a change for the confused students, the students that were engaged in the lesson may become unengaged or bored. That would be the downfall of using this sort of technology.

A very appropriate setting for the Facial Action Coding System would be online schooling and home schooling because both of those are mainly based on the one student taking that course or class. If the camera on the computer sent a signal to the online schooler or home schooler, it would be easy to make a change in the lesson to try and get the student more engaged. Having a student pay more attention and be more engaged in a lesson could actually help raise test scores because if someone was doing something that was actually fun and they could actually retain the knowledge, it might be effective.

Using the Facial Action Coding system in classrooms is valuable and effective. It will help students become more engaged and pay more attention. It will also help raise test scores at least partially because they will be able to remember what they learned when it was something that they liked. While some might have contradictory thoughts, it is mostly a valuable piece of technology that should be used in many schools across the world.   ",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8
BB04B818FF32,"Have you ever thought about a computer reading your emotions? me neither, that sounds pretty cool huh. Well today its possible for your emotions to be read by new technology called ""the Facial Action Coding System"" created by Dr. Paul Eckman, this allows computers to recognize human emotions. I believe that this new technology can change things and improve the relationship between computers and humans.

Now lets take it back to Leonardo da Vinci and his Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa. Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help him paint muscles on the face as precisely as possible to show specific emotions. This painting was the first to be tested on this new software, yes a painting not real physical human face. The result showed hat Mona Lisa was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry. The whole process of calculating emotions begins with a computer constructed 3-D model of the being identified, the 44 important muscles have to move like human muscles. the movement of one or muscles is called a ""action unit"".

Dr. Eckman has classified the six basic emotions which are; Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Dr. Haung says in this passage that ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly)"". humans calculate emotions everyday, you can tell when your friend is mad, sad, tired just by looking at their face. but not everyone can some people have trouble reading facial expressions on people.

Think about a computer knowing your exact emotion. For example when your doing an assignment that requires you to do research and the computer can tell that your getting bored with the website that you found by indentifiying your emotions at the moment, it could give you other sites that might interest you.

Now on the other hand you can figure stuff out on your on because you can feel certain stuff that is wrong with ya like, for Example you can wake up and just know today is not my day...I mean come on now like you just know if someone talks to you the wrong way you are gonna pop off or if someone looks at you the wrong way you are gonna flip out about it and start going off. You can know or not if you are not feeling it today because really its a mind set thing...You have to process you mind to certain and be like you know this is not the right thing to do you just know it.

You could see the percentage of how happy, sad, or angry a person is by their facial expression. This seems like a technology that would take years to create, but it has already been created. This technology is already being used and perfected as we speak. While creating this technology it was suggested that we should put this into classrooms around the country to read the emotions of the students. I believe that this would be nonbeneficial and a major invasion of privacy for the students.

Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institue for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. Thomas and his colleagues have created a technology that can calculate your emotional state. This would be expressed by a percentage of the six basic emotions; happiness, suprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness. However, according to the article in order for this to work,""the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face."" Therefore this would mean that the students would be watched by a computer or camera at all time for this technology to work. There can be arguements made that students are already watched by a camera or a computer at all times. While this is true, students are only watched to monitor their actions in the school environment to ensure the safety of the students. However, this would be watching more than just the actions of the students. It would be monitoring their body language, facial expressions, and emotional state. This would be a complete invasion of privacy for the students in our schools.

This article also shows how this technology can benefit the learning of the students. The article states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This would be a great thing for the students if we already have a human instructer. It is a teachers job to do the tasks that has been stated above. The article supports this by saying, ""In fact, we humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" If humans already have the capability to perform this task, then why do we need a machine to do it for us.

Therefore I believe that this technology would not be beneficial to students. As stated above, humans already have the capability to read emotional expressions on a day to day basis. This would also be a complete invasion of privacy seeing how the students would have to be monitored constantly in order for this technology to work. When someone asks you if you would want this to be put in the classroom environment. Think to yourself, would I want my child to be watched constantly and envade their privacy to read how they are feeling?   ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
ABBBEE1FCCD1,"Modern day technology can identify human emotions. One very strong claim and great example is the 3D computer model. It begins when the computer constructs the model of a human face or painting.

Leonardo da Vinci, a famous artist, painted The Mona Lisa, but new technology computer software can recognize emotion, according to Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois. The 3D computer model can construct all 44 major muscles in the humans body, but it must move like human muscles. The movent of one or more muscles during this process is called an ""action unit"". According to Dr. Huang, ""facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", even though some individuals often show varying degrees of expression.

When using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software can track facial movements in a real face in a student or painting. Weighing in different units, the software can identify mixed emotions because each experssion is compared against a neutral face. For instance, in person, you can probably tell how someone is feeling simply by the look on his/her face. Scientists and Professors today would go over types of human emotions through the 3D computer model.

The home PC you own can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's or any humans smile. The Facial Action Coding System only enables lab computers or computers at a University to identify human emotions. This same technology is used to make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery.

In conlusion, modern day technology can identify human emotions through a 3D computer or The Facial Action Coding System. The value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions is very valuable and can be used to express how someone feels.

Everyone experences diffrent things every day no matter what they do. People may always be distgusted by going somewhere or even leaving something valuable for something thats not worth a probably a penny. A lot of people are happy for there own reasons might be seeing the sun shine. Or even hearing birds singing we dont need a computuer for these when we know how to read emotions. A computer desgined to read or emotions on calculate emotions, facial expressions, and impressive calculations no bodody needs a computer to read what we our feeling.

When someone asks if your ok from what they are seeing from your eyes face or acting they try to help they dont calculate emotions for someone. In paragraph 2 ""how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"".

Do we type what makes us sad and a robot answers with a question or something silly or something out of subject for the answer. In paragraph 3 ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"".

If it just looks at the human muscles than theres in issue becuase we could be hurt and not be sad, or something else it could just be we hurt something or just lost a tooth we don't need the calculations to tell us how we feel.

Facial expressions is when we are show if we are happy, sad, angry, and surpirisesd. In paragraph 4 "" emotions are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like smiling broadly)."" Everyone can read peoples expressions unless they just look the same everyday of the week. Therapists are trained for this to see how people are to read to see how they feel if they feel bad or good. In paragraph 4 ""By weighting the diffrent units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece)"". The computer might be better for paintings made by people or even a pictures in a book, and games.

Not everyone is good at looking at facial expressions or how somone is acting out if someone takes the time to help there friends out or even somebody they can see that they can read emotions well enough without a computer.

The conclusion is we dont need machines helping us with our emotions. If we do we gotten lazy or even just they cant read it or they dont want to read the facial expression on there face. Some of us are glad we can help others for not ourselves without the help of tech we dint need tech in every part of our lives. What we need is people that can help or even want to help us out.

0916B9AA4575,"Computers have come a long way in the past few decades. Coming from computers that filled up an entire roomonly having so much as 2 gigabytes (GB) or smaller for memoryto having a computer that is smaller than your torso and can contain as much as 128 GB (or more) of memory. However, we have only started scratching the surface on the technology of facial recognition. Believe it or not, there is now software that canfor the most partread your emotions!

The software is the latest creation made by Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, who works in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. (1) Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologist Dr. Paul Eckman who is ""the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System)"" (3).

How the computer works is that it creates a 3-D computer model of the face that incorporates all 44 major muscles of the human face into the model. Eckman has classfied these six basic emotions into the software: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. (3) Each emotion is associated with characteristic action units to differentiate between emotions. (3) Video imagery (4) is used to capture these action units. For example the text says: ""frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when youre surprised;..."" (3). The computer captures all of that.

This advancement of technology is truly fascinating, however it can be harshly criticised by the public if it comes out to classrooms now. It's new and can only capture so much; they only considered using emotional features from six basic and distinct emotions that Eckman ensued into this innovation. (3)

It can also be compatible with one computer, so it wouldn't be practical or create a state of financial stability if a school had to buy one for each student. Even if it were software it could probably slow down a less-compatible device and could hinder the work process in a school for a machine whose sole purpose is to capture how a student scorns during a math lesson.

If the tech were to be efficient in speed and usage in a classroom or any other setting, then it should be a necessity in school. However, with programs such as Google, the computer just would not be necessary. In the text it says: ""Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" (6) Google does that by taking information you search publicly in your own Google accounts.

As for identifying how students feel during class, as said in the text in paragraph six: "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr Huang predicts."" (6) Teachers are able to get a public opinion by using a program by Google Classroom to send a poll out to their students, or just by being amicable and approachable enough to let students ask questions about confusing material.

If the previous information can be proved wrong, then it would be good to have in a classroom. But how can a computer capture someone's emotions if they have their hand over their face or their head down? They simply can't help that type of situation. Also, humans are very complex creatures. People can act like they seem happy outwardly, even if they aren't. Some people can be born with facial deformities. Deformities in people's faces can be very unitelligable to the eyes of society, in some cases, or just stoic due to a chronic disease that causes muscle tissue to be stiff. The program would not be able to read people's emotions if they can't express it like most people can due to their conditions. Again, the program was designed for an average human face and only 6 emotions as a base. (3)

As a civilization, we are moving forward. It would not be a surprise if in a decade or two, every classroom has an emotion-reading computer that works efficiently for everyone. However, as of now, we are only merely scraping what is FACS tech and how to modify it into our everyday lives. Releasing this innovation to the public mow wouldn't be practical due to how new it is. But it would be cool to have something that works that way with little error.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
738E700E4719,"The use of technology being able to read the emotional expressions of students is a little bit personal and invading someones privacy and their space just to see what they are actually feeling is pointless. I don't think that it is just to find out what someone is feeling if they don't want to tell you how they feel or don't want to be bothered then they should have that respect of not having to explain to everyone what's wrong. It would also divided people even more than they already are esspecially in schools, kids wouldn't hang out with each other if they had that type of technology to find out what someone else is feeling.

One reason for saying that emotional express reading is that it not the school job to tell a student, tell other students, or anybdy else what someone is feeling, besides possibly his or her parents being informed. My choice for saying that reason is that teachers, students, and people that aren't really associated with the person the are trying to read shouldn't have the elligability to read someone else's emotions. If they wanted to get to know the person they should do it naturally instead of seeing how they feel and then not wanting to be friends with them because maybe they are angry or depressed or what ever emotions that normlly others them from wanting to be frineds with someone or at least talking and having normal conversations.

My second reason for being opposed to the idea of using technology to find out what someone is feeling at the moment is that it's an invasion of privacy which is one of natural rights and not abiding by that natural right is essentually breaking the law. If someone doesn't want anyone to read their emotions then it should be left at that, but there are people that will push that boundry and do it anyway which isn't right.

My third and final reason for not agreeing with using technology to read emotions is that it divides people even more than they already are. If everyone was able to read someones emotions then everybody would know everone else with out knowing them, and what I mean by this is that they won't take the time to talk to them and get to know them but they will judge them on what technology says and will more than likely not like one of the emotions being read and possibly stay awaay or make fun of them because of it. Technology like that would keep apart and not really wanting to get up and visit people as much as it does now with smartphones and computers that have social media where people no longer have to go outside to visit their friends next door, they can just call them and not actually enjoy the outside and activities that come with it but will stay inside the house doing nothing but texting and calling.

To conclude my claim against the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions is a little bit personal and invading someones privacy and their space just to see what they are actually feeling is pointless. I don't think that it is just to find out what someone is feeling if they don't want to tell you how they feel or don't want to be bothered then they should have that respect of not having to explain to everyone what's wrong.

Using technology would be a good idea to tell the different types of expresions because imagine someone being really mad and you did not know. I think technology would be a good idea because they could have many different options to choose from.

For example on paragraph 3 it gives really good reasons on why technology would be good. It show that a computer can construct a 3-Dmodel face showing all 44 mucles in our face and it would move like actual human muscles. The movement of our muscles are called action units. We have would have six emotions to tell to someone and a computer could do it all by its self.

We humans may have the same expression on a daily day basis because most of the time we are not happy consedering the fact that most of our facial expressions are angry, sad , happy , surpris fear, and disgust, so this means that with just a computer you can do anything when it comes to facial expresions. Also on paragraph 4 it says that '' using video imagery'' would be really good to tell the emotions through facial movements or on a painting like Mona Lisa. A new software would be good to tell the facila emotions for example like on the masterpice of da Vinci that the expressions are compared to the natural face of a person.

This idea of computer emotional expressions would be a good one because with just a scan or a picture would be great because they wouldn't have to be asking the person what is wrong with them. I think this would be way much easy to tell wheather the person is mad, sad, or surprised this idea would work also on pictures that may not show no expressions

In my opinion i think this would cause good controversials because your emotions would simply be easy to reach like in Mona Lisa picture. Your expression can change real quick as to when your standing in the mirror or when you are really happy , sad, or mad. This would help for when a person is showing a fake smile or when a celebrity is being truthful with the camras.

One reason i dont think its valuable because emotions can change at any moment .Saying someone is 80% happy in a pictuer wouldnt always be ture becuase they could be smiling but also could be more sad than they are happy. Some people have a bipolar disoder which makes their eomtion change very fast , and some people are just very temperamental. Some students show emotions differnt than others . For example one student that is very upset could be yelling and shouting about it and another student that as angery as the other student could be very calm about it and not showing that they are angery.

Another reason i dont think its acurrate is because sometimes we dont just use one muscle to make a facial expresion. The computer only test one facial muscle to an emotion. Paragraph three states"" For example , your frontails pars laterlis muscle raises your eyebrows when your surprised ..."" but also when someone is surprised they sometimes move their mouth muscles. We move our mouth muscles for almost every emotion.

I dont think it would be a good idea to put one of these computers in a classroom becuase each student shows emotion different and some students might not shoe emotion at all , therefore the computer would be getting emotion from about half the claaroom which wouldnt be acurrate .",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

Also in paragraph 6 Dr. Huang states ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, so computers need to understand that too."" meaning that in day to day life humans interact by facial movements or gestures so if computers could read those expressions and gestures, life could be made easier. Finally, in paragraph 8 it reads ""muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes.

The Facial Action Coding System can allow us to keep students in classrooms entertained while learning a lesson just by seeing there facial expressions. This is a great idea and can truly work, it will keep students focused and allow them to pay more attention in a class room setting. This can help a lot because students will be more entertained and will pay attention in class.

Millions of students go to school every single day dreading what they will learn next. Half of the time when you're in class you will look over and see one person sleeping. However, if the Facial Action Coding System is put in classrooms this could give students a chance to be more alive during a lesson. Since it is able to read our facial expressions, it can see when students are becoming bored or irritated of the lesson and switch it up a little bit. In fact, it could possibly make learning fun again. Students will no longer dread going to class all the time, and it can finally be something to look forward too.

By installing the Facial Action Coding System into classrooms, teachers would be able to understand their students emotions more, and know what to do if people are becoming distracted. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Teahcers would be able to know if they need to switch up the lesson and make it more entertaining. This could cause less problems in students failing in school, and really change everything. In fact, if more teachers make classroom learning fun, more students will be less likely to fail.

In my perceptative I like this idea but then I don't. It is pretty nice that we have a software that can be able to do something like this. it is pretty cool to tell people that we need a picture of you or someone and we will see how happy you are, how mad you are, etc. But I'm really not for it that much. There can be more things we can do instead of doing this. But doing this picture was preety cool.

In paragrpah 5 it states that people can tell how your friend is feeling simply by the look on their face. I totally agree with it. If this is your best friend and they are the same to you when you see each other you should smile. But when they don't and still look down then you know there is a problem. Friends are there for each other.

One thing that I argue about this is on paragrpah 6. When you are happy then when a ad pops up then it should be happy. Same way if you were mad then a mad or something down ad will pop up. I don't really agree to this because when people see ads they dont really pay attention to ads. When they see an ad they look at the close button for it and they close it.

51E6F16CE862,"The Facial Action Coding System is a great program with many applacations. We have facial expressions even when were not feeling any thing but we dont realize it. Takeing the The ""FACS"" would be great in schools. Not it also can pick out the ones who cant consentrate, when they are overwhelmed .It would allow teachers to get real time feedback on what they just introduced to the students.

The more majority of kid dont like to admit that the dont under stand somthing when all their classmates do. So ""FACS"" could help find kids that are confused before they fall behind,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a students is becoming confused or bored"" - 6 Nick D' Alto. This could help improve students test scores becuase the teacher would know who needs a bit more time for and explanation and who under stands it. This could help students from digging themselves a hole , but it's not a total safey net they still have to do the work.

Facial action coding system have one of the best uses in the classroom. They can see somthing that teachers cant or dont notice. With this tech we could also spot learning disaplitys earlier too, so they dont get maked as a ""dumb"" kid and get swept under the rug.

C520733738FF,"in this essay i am going to be writting about how a new technology called the facial action coding system enable computers to identify human emotions. an i am going to be writting that this could be valuable. i am going to be writting about why this is valuble.

first,in this paragraph i am going to be writting about how ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal.""in the article it says that some individuals often show diffrent types of expression,for example they used the one not smiling as broadly. what this is showing that this new thing that can identify the emotions could be usefull because it can let ther people know what is wrong with you and why you are not happy or why you are sad. in the article it also said that it can identify mixed emotions as they used da vinci's masterpiece.

second,in this paragraph i am writting about how this could help you with your friends and other people around you. in the article it says that we could already tell how one of our friends is feeling and how they look because we already know them. but it also says that we could probobly have some trouble describing them facial traits. and that is what this new technology does it tells you and shows you th facial traits that convey happy and worried.

third,in this paragraph i am going to be writting about how this could be useful in class and how this could help others. the example they used was a computer and some ads. the ads could tell your smile and if you are happy then another ad will pop up that is similar,but also if you frown the ads will be diffrent. they used a computer in a classrom because in the article it says that this computer could recognize if the student is becoming cnfused or bored. aalso in the article it says that this means that it could modify the lesson to the way you might understand it. this is why i think this is valuable in some cases.

in conclusion,i wrote about how this could be valuable. i said that this could be valuable because this could be used to show the diffrent emotions and how people are feeling. i also wrote about how this could be used in the classrom because it could tell wether they are confused with the lesson and if they are then the computer will modify the lesson to a way that you could understand it. this is what i wrote about in this essay and i am sying that yes this could be valuable in the classrooms.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
EB191792379F,"Would you like someone to be able to read your emotions? Reading someone's emotions ican help you know that they need some help. Here are some reasons why it is good to be able to read emotions.

Reading the emotions of someone is amazing and should be used. In the article, Dr. Huang stated, ""The facial expresions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varing degrees of expression."" This shows why it is important to know how people feel when they are being taught something they don't understand.

Reading a person's emotions can be complicated when you're with a friend. The article states, "" She's (The Mona Lisa) 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This says that when The Mona Lisa was painted, she had 4 different emotions. When your with friends, it is unclear how they feel.

This research shows why it is necesary to read the emotions of somebody to know how they feel. This face reading software can help people who need help but can't tell others how they feel. Using software to read friends emotions can show you when they need your help.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
9FAEE71C268E,"In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa smile"", by Nick D'Alto, the author explain how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers software to detect human emotions. The use of this technology can help teachers recognize their students feelings or emotions in order to help them in the areas they need help in. The author states, ""the new-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa"". The new technology can help teachers recognize if the contents being taught in class is boring or confusing for the students and it will help the teacher to clarify or modify the lesson or determine a way to help the students understand the materials.

The system can help teachers identify their students emotions through their facial expression.

Many experts are developing ways to recognize and percieve mixed emotions and subtle facial movements we use to express how we feel through technology. This new technology can be very effective in classrooms all over the world. It will help enhance students learning in classroom also it will be useful for the teacher as well.

In the article, the author states, ""A classroom computer could recould recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", Dr Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"".

Many teachers can use this new technology to boost their student knowledge and make learning fun for the students.

Teachers can also use this new technology to promote their students growth. They can use this new technology to determine the areas they can help their students in by using this new technology to detect how they feel about the contents being taught in class. Many students don't ask questions or ask for help even if they need it.

""Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"", notes Dr. Huang. ""So computers need to understand that too"", states Dr. Huang. By using this new technology, teachers can recognize nonverbal and emotional communication in order to find a way to help their students.

The new technology can enhance students enthusiasm. It can build their confidence in learning through their achievements in school. It will helps students with their performance in school and their grades. Teachers using this technology to detect how their students feel about the lessons being taught in class and finding a way to help them with their studies can help students achieve high scores on their test. The technology is very valuable in classroom.

In conclusion, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very useful and valuable. It can help teachers to recognize how their students feel about the materials being taught in class in order to help them better understand it. It can also help teacher clarify topics to students and help them achieve a high score on their tests. The new technology can make learning fun for students.

B62DB13C6E18,"I disagree that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because why should we care if this kind of technology knows about our emotions, It is a waste of time and money, worst things could happen if FACS becomes the next big thing.

First, why should we care if this kind of technology knows about our emotions. Technology is basically making life easier to work. For example building constructions with cranes, using snow blowers to get the driveway cleared up faster, building wind turbines and solar panels to harvest energy from the earths elements. This type of technology does not need to know how we feel. Technology should only envolve if it is going to greatly effect the future in a positive way.

Second, it is a waste of time and money. There is no benefit of having Facial Action Coding System but one, reading our emotions. It is the peoples' job to know how all of us feel. People who are into technology should only spend money if and only if they are making life easier. FACS should not be pattented, it is a waste of time, and no benefit but one and that is reading our emotions.

Last but not least, worst things could happen if FACS becomes the next big thing. People out there already making androids that speak like humans, look like humans, and eventually act like ones. What is next? Androids doing their own job by doing curtain actions, or maybe taking our everyday jobs so that we can sit on our couch being lazy, and get fat because we are no longer proactive. My history teacher said,""When is helping hurting?"" You don't realise it until something bad happens.

In conclusion, the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is ""not"" valuable because we shoud not care if FACS knows about our emotions.

The artice is saying that the new techonology can determine ones emotions due to their face muscles. This new techonology being able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it could let a teacher or someone know that something is wrong and could help them. Also, it is valuable because like the article said if the student seems confused or unintrested the computer could modify the lesson. Another reason why it is valuable is because it could help with classes that you're taking.

Letting the teacher know that something is wrong with the student can be a great help because they could give the student recources to comfort the or even just try to talk to them and see if they need further help. If a student is not feeling well it could impact their school work and potentionally hurt their grades. With this new technology it can possibly prevent the student emotions hurt their school work and grades. With that being said this technology can help improve students in a classroom.

As I stated in my introduction i said that this new technology can help the students learn better. The way this software works is that the computer that the student is using in the classroom wil can have complex algorithms to determine the students feelings. Now if the student is showing a confusion facial expression it could modify the lesson as if the teacher was to do so. if the computr determines that the student is confued or bored and it modifys the lesson it could help the student by actually teaching/ presenting something that is going to be able to teach them more effectively.

This new software can help som student with the classes their taking. It could help with art, drama, music, speech class. The way it could help with art is that being able to determine emotions can benefit how the artist protrays what they are making by knowing what feautures dtermine a persons emotions. for drama clas it can benefits also by helping with facial expressions on stage or when ever they are preforming. In the article it states that a ""renowned drama coach, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage.""

Keeping in mind that some student would not want their emotional expressions being read due to their privacy. But if some student were to agree on being read if could potentionally help them academically and emotionally.

In conclusion, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. This new techonology being able to read can help because it could let a teacher or someone know that something is wrong and could help them. Also, it can help the student if they seem confused or unintrested the computer could modify the lesson. Another reason why it is valuable is because it could help with classes that you're taking.

But it also will make other people uncomfortable, those who have problems or they just don't want to talk about it, they might feel ashamed, furios or emberrass and will cause low selfsteem in their lives. In the picture in the right about Mona Lisa, according to the Facial Action Coding System she is 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry, maybe she never talk about how she felt when the picture was took and people just say she was happy and she wasn't happy at all . in conclusion, these new technology will make people understand more how other feels and people will be able to understand and konw more about that person's life and why they feel like that, and just making things up that are not true.

I believe this could be a good use for in the future for students in school who deals with depression and anxiety and doesn't show it. Some students probably wont't like the idea of a computer telling how you're really feeling because like some they probably doesn't like to show any emotions but this technology could help a lot of students out dealing with their emotions.

It would be just like us telling a friend how are they feelings just like in the article its says For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feelin simply by the look on her face"".

We all need just a reminder to smile every once and a while just like in the article it also says helps the muscles and helps preduce them.

I think if you going use technology to calculate someones emotion they should aleast do it and keep it private. Im going to be telling you a little bit about why using technology to read student emotion is bad.

First of all i am against using this technology because, In the passage it says Faces dont lie and it can tell when someone is inmatating a fake smile and i dont really think that is true sometimes faces do lie. I honestly think that being able to read student emotion is awsome in all but its kinda personal. i dont think people want other people know about their emotions. i also think that if this technology is used people will probably become addicted to it and it will probably start getting on people nerves. In the passage it states that when a student becomes bored and confused Dr. huang predicts that it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor.

In conclusion use this technology will probably effect people thoughs and emotions. It will also effect how people feel towards one they care about it will cause a whole lot of misunstands confustion effection and unsterstanding. i think that using a computer technology to calculate someone emotion is bad for the enviroment and if we just ramdomly add technology in the world to know people emotions it will get crazy and out of hand.

So just because you rate that website a 7 doesnt mean you like it you might just want them to think its a good website. The computer would have to be very reliable and trusting for it to be valuable. The students these days is hard to tell because they just don't care anymore. If they don't care then there is no way to tell if they like something or not.

So in my opinion no I don't think they should use the technology to read emotions because it will make things more expensive and less people will buy them.

One might say that this new technology can limit student-teacher interactions, which is not benficiary to the students at all. One might also say that this type technology will lead students to become more dependant on technology then the Teacher. These can be proven true but a majority of our communication is nonverbal.

I think we sould really give kids the right to hide their feelings if they want to because i know what its like not talking about thinks but there is only so much people can take before talking so kids should reealy have the right to hide it if they want to. It could also inbarise kids because of them not wanting anyone to know they are sad or mad but the computor knows and they had not choice if the computor knows or not. I think kids have the right to have a little privetce and not have to tell anyone whats going one.

The facial action coding system is a good thing in school by letting the teacher know that something isnt right with that student and somethimng need to happen. i think that it will help kinds lern in school.

Making Mona Lisa Smile is written by Nick D'Alto,and it points out the fact how computers can tell how emotions by calculation. A technology known as the facial action coding system enables computers to indentify human emotions. Some of the advantages of the computers is that it can observe, calculate and identify the human muscles.

One way the computers can identify how emotions is by observing the 44 major muscles bone in human. Creating a 3-D model of the face the computers has been able to observe this muscles and where they are located in the body and their movement, in paragraph one the text states that ""

the process begins when the computers constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. without observation of this mucles movement in the body the computer wouldn't be able to indentify the muscles that actually produce this emotions. Therefore they also need to calculate like humans.

in anothert different way the computers have been able to calculate this bones that makes this emotions in the body through the producers. The producers observes the way human tell emotions by calculation, on paragraph five the text states that "" in fact we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday. for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by simply looking on her face. Calculation is one important thing the computers need to do for better result without them calculating like humans they would probably give us wrong result, and they can do this by observation of the bones shape. whereby can tell emotions.

Way other way computers would provide specific answer like angry, happy... is by knowing the parts of the body to identify the positions of the bone. Emotions as we know can be told by looking at the face at an individual face, on paragraph 7 it says ""while looking at the mirror: raise your lips at the cornersof your mouth, then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling (""cow's-feet) at the corner of your eyes, holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up. toward your eyes"" basically the computer has to identify parts of your body to detects the bones which can produce excellent result.

In conclusion, we can now see that computers can actually detect exactly and maybe more accurately than human's. struggling everyday to find out if he or she has actually forgiving you about yesterday would be more easy than ever. Through calculation and observation we see the ability and capacity of how this technology can make our life easier, teacher wouldn't have to confirm if students understand the topic if they act like they do.

It would be good to use this type of techonlogy in a classrrom because the teacher will notice when his class is gettting bored and is learning less, so the teacher can improve something to do better and make his student to pay attention and learn more. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Most of the times when a student is bored in class is because he does not like his class, and whyhe does not like his class? probably he dont understand well, and the student needs help, so if the teacher would have this technology they will know what is happening, and they can try to fix this problem, either making his class more interesting,explain more, staying more time, or working after school. The point of of this is to make students to focus and be able to learn well. After the students learn they will doing better in school, better grades, and later on they can have better future.

This new technology can help us in many ways because it can helps us to know if there is something wrong happening that maybe it needs to be changed, if we choose to use it we would increase our opportunies to do good. kids would have better education, and the better our education is the better our nation will be.

CF52358A03FF,"Of all things that you would want to learn about the human face, what would you want to know about the most? In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" author Nick D'Alto explains why and how emotional expression is valuable. In this instance, being able to tell what emotions people would have by using smart computer programs such as the ""Faciak Action Coding"" system would be revolutionary. This would be an amazing ability to have because it could most likely help people with a lot of life problems.

D'Alto explains that by calculating the facial muscles in the human face, his example being the face of the Mona Lisa, you could instantly detect each emotion like a simple math equation. This would be very helpful because it could help people with things such as school. D'Alto supports that claim by quoting Dr. Thomas Huang, who says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"", and that if the computer does recognize the situation ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human

This techonlogy should be valubale, and usable. It would help the human societcy amazingly.

1028F5A588AA,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes the new technology facial Action Coding System or FACS which allows a computer to pick up on what you feel like and how you are feeling. I claim that the use of FACS in a class room enviroment could have used but mostly believe it is not a valuable resource in class.

One reason why It is not a vaulable resource is it only programed to read six basic human emotions which are Happieness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.

Another reason why it is invaulable is that a human is already prepared to read another persons emotions because it is a task that is already done each and everyday. Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states ""using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face."" This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet.

Another person could say it is vaulable to help students and keep them entertained in a lesson and switch it up a bit. Dr. Huang is talking about how it can change the ads you see and veiw if you dont look happy when you look at them. Dr. Huang states ""For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work but the problem being is that a program so complex like that requires so much code and algorithms that it requires a beffy computer to run so you would need to make multiple servers capable of holding that much information not only that but the school would have to divert much more of their budget toward stronger computers because Dr. Huang states Your home Pc cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode smiles"" This saying from Dr. Huang proves that a PC for home use is not strong enough for this program so what makes you average home pc different from a school one other than filters put on the pc which reduces preformance but the worse thing that could happen is what if the power happens to shut down or go out do to a surge that program requires power to run so that is also a big problem.

In conclusion, The use of FACS in a classroom enviroment sounds like a great idea but when you put it in different catagories it fails in almost every one of them you dont need a computer to read emotions when a human is perfectly capable of know how you feel even if it is just a little bit. The schools will need more funding diverted to even run the program and keep it working when schools already have a budget that they have to work on and they will need to be prepared to do something if the power goes out because that system will not run if it has incffecient power.",6,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,1.0
6F8200CADE90,"The Facial Action Coding System technology that let you reads emotional expressions of students. I strongly disagree with this statement because emtions is not some that you can just get a computer software to scan you to let you know if your happy or sad. How can a computer just express how humans feel emotions are some you feel when another person tell you that you are speacial, and not by letting a computer tell you. Computers are program to do what you wan them to do and help with things such as homework, research pappers and essays they are a software system bulit to help you with over the site needs.

Dr. haung and his collegue are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. I feel like you can't just program a computer to pick what emotions you think students are feeling,a and what if the software system was wrong and thats not what the student was feeling. Emotions are a feeling you get when you feel like you don't have a care in the world , or when that special someone makes you happy because they smiled at you those are emtions they are inside you not on a machine that was bulit by man to tell you how you feel.

And in my conclusion the facial expressions for each emoion are univeral oberves,and even though individuals show varying degress of expressions. Each student have the own facial expression is compared aginst a neutral face showing no emotion in a student face. A machine that will let you know if a student is borde or confused is good but that's why we have are own voice to let our teacher know that we need help.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
6C09B4AA6A77,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I'll be using details from the article to form an eassay arguing whether the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom is valuable. I'll be sure to include, a claim for or against the value of using ths technology to read student' emotional expressions, evidence from the article to support the claim, and an introductions, a body, and a conclusion to my essay. The reasons i'm going to use are why it's valuable, how we can use it to help other, and how to use it correctly.

First of all let me explain the passge, the passage talks about how we can use technology to identify human emotions. How is this technology valuable, well it's very valuable. The FACS (Facial Actions Coding System) which is the technology that identify humans emotions, can let us see how everyone is. We can use the FACS everywhere that will help us to help people. Help everyone, and even animals. Help everyone in there time of need. Help those whom don't want help. Those who can't control themselves. Those that can't think correctly. Those whom are at the blink of death. A lot of people and so many more lives can be save with this technology.

How can we use it to help others? We can use the FACS to identify human emotions and help the ones that are sad. We can help them before somethings happens, like we can prevent a school shooting if we know how the persons feels. We can give them all the help they need. No lives have to be lost if we know how everyone feels. We can even stop people from killing themselves, we can change lives with this technology. We can even help those who don't want help because they are people to that are hurting. We have to help those in need and I know we can do it with the help of the FACS and change the world. It would be a lot safe out there. We can do all of this because of FACS and that's why i think its very valuable.

But there always a correct time to use this. If we can tell if someone is really depress that's when we do something because it's hard to control yourself when you are really sad. We shouldn't just wait and see what happens, we have to do something about it, because we are all human. If we see someone very depress we try to cheel them up, but what if we can't tell. That's also another example when we should use them. We can stop things from happening, bad things.

Futhermore I believe that the use of this technology can be very useful in many ways. In my essay i have show you why it's valuable, how we can use it to help other, and how to use it correctly. I also include a claim for or against the value of using ths technology to read student' emotional expressions, evidence from the article to support the claim, and an introductions, a body, and a conclusion to my essay. This technology called the FACS (Facial Actions Coding System) which is the technology that identify humans emotions, can help many people in there life, make it easliy for us to help those people, can help save people lives from hurting themselves or others, and make us prevent school shooting, people killing themselves, and save people life in many ways.

One reason I think it will work is because as a student I personally tend to get bored and doze off and get distracted. I also know this happens to other kids because too because when i'm bored I look around the room so i see all the other students who are not paying attention. If a student were toget mad and the computer sensed this and changed up the lesson then that could get the student back into it and make them want to do the work. these computers would make it the same as having a perfect teacher there for every student.

9631D2A1BB2C,"Im going to tell you if the facial action coding system is a good or bad idea. First the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vincis masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).

In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc.

Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.

The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do. Imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad. For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Huang. So computers need to understand that, too.

This technology could help teachers in the classroom or coaches working on film or a business, to see how all of their workers or their students are reacting to all that is being thrown at them. this benefits the teachers mostly because society has changed so much and alot of stuff is done on computers and they teach alot of lessons off of computers and in the text it says "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This means that whenever a student is sitting there learning the lesson and something comes up and they are very confused they may make a face of confusion and the computer will read that face and the teacher could know how the students felt about the lesson based on the results that the computer came up with when the students were learning the lesson. From there she could help certain students figure something out or teach them an alternative way because now she knows that some kids dont get the material. With this new technology she is able to figure out who is getting the material and who is not and before, she could not figure out if a student was having trouble with the material or not because most of the time students dont speak up and say anything when they are confused because they feel like they are the only ones who are having trouble but with this technology they dont even have to say a word they can just express their emotions and the computer will pick it up. With this new technology it knows what a fake expression is and what is not a fake expression do to the muscles inside your face.

4A78B7E0CD23,"Human emotion can be expressed by many things such as body language, tone, and language. Emotion allows us to understand others and empathize easier. A software known as Facial Action Coding System has been developed to improve accuracy of calculating the emotions of others. Using this technology to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is invaluable because humans already can ""calculate"" emotions, the classroom is not taught by a computer, and human emotions are very complex.

The first reason that the FACS is invaluable to the classroom is because there is no need to use technology to ""calculate"" emotions of a student. A classroom consists of a teacher and several students which are humans. The author stated within the article, ""humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day,"" He further on states that we can probably tell how a friend feels just by the look on their face. Since humans can already perceive and understand emotions of others, there is no need for a mode of technology to figure out when someone is bored or confused about certain subjects in a classroom. When a student is bored or confused about a certain subject, he or she could simply ask for help from a teacher or a peer. Using the FACS technology would be redundant in reading emotional expressions of students; Therefore, it is invaluable technology.

Computers are not what teach students in a classroom. The author tells the reader to imagine a classroom computer that could recognize your emotions, so it could ""modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" There is always a human instrcutor( the teacher) in a classroom, so there should not be a need for a modification of a lesson by a computer when the teacher can modify the lesson. Students do not need to be dependent on a computer to learn what they need to learn in a classroom, and a computer that can calculate emotion is obsolete by its uselessness in the manner of learning.

The final reason why emotion calculating technology is invaluable in a classroom is that emotion is too complex for just a classroom computer to calculate. First of all, emotion differs from person to person. In the aritcle Dr. Huang, a professor of the University of Amsterdam, said, ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal,"" but he also stated, ""individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" If emotional expressions are all unique, it would be very difficult for computers to calculate the exact feeling a students is feeling just by their facial expression. Also, in the seventh paragraph, the author stated, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."" This means that the classroom computer would not be able to calculate like how it was used in the article.

In conclusion, the FACS is too redundant and under developed to be of any use for a classroom enviorment. It is invaluable and there are mulitple substitutes that can read emotional expressions of students in a school. In the future, with further innovations, there will be a time where classrooms use this type of technology to enhance education; but as of right now, the system is not useful for helping classrooms teach students.",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8

There are many emotions in a student in a class room that a student wouldn't want to be recogize . For many student there always someone who is in love and does not want anyone to figure it out . In paragrahp 3 it tells readers that "" happiness, surpise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" can all be shown with the Facial Action Coding System. The student might be sad because the girl wouldn't go out on a date with him and show that emotion in class.

For many students I honstley think alot of students would not like it . Another reason why it would not be a good idea to put this new Facial Action Coding System in many classroom is it might distract many of the students. Alot of classroom students are already going through alot of things like stressing, grades, finals, and credits. They wouldn't want that to be pick up by the system for a example a student could be really sad about his grades and doen't want anyone to know. Our minds are only safe place to go where anyone can't go.

Other places would be a better option for the Facial Action Coding like hostiptals and nursing homes. A good reason why I think it would be a good idea at a hostpital because it can help alot of people that are sick and feeling pain. In paragraph 3 it say the system can pick up happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. At a hostpital a patient could be help out with the machine and tell if she or he is sad or happy. At a nursing home he can help out the the old folks by making sure that there not depressed or angry.

What if the Facial Action Cding system shows that 50% percent of the student show that they really get the work. And the other 50% percent do not get the work what would the teacher do? Would the teacher choice be right to choose to get the same work where the 50% percent doesn't understand it and give the same work to the other 50% percent of the class that already knows how to solve the work. I think it not a good idea for classrooms to have Facial Action Coding System at schools.

At schools it might not be a good idea and might be better in many other places. For many students it coulld distract them or if other dont want to show emotions because of there personal thoughts being shown to teachers. Would you want schools to have this new Facial Action Coding System at there school and on computers?            ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
89BF18395FCC,"As technology advances, humans find themselves wondering whether it is helpful or if it hinders humanity. According to Prof. Thomas Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, computer software is now able to detect emotions in facial expressions. Although the software could help notify teachers when the students feel confused, this software could also make students feel insecure and violated. The Facial Action Coding System should not be used in the classroom.

Dr. Huang believes that his new software could inhance the classroom setting. It would ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson,"" (paragraph 6). However, it is healthy for students to have human interactions with a teacher. Also, having the initiative to speak up if they do not understand something is part of becoming independent. School prepares kids for life beyond high school by giving them the freedom to speak up and to make their own decisions. Placing a Facial Action Coding System in the class would not help solve the need for students to learn how to live independently.

In paragraph two Dr. Huang states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that, too."" I strongly disagree with this statement. Being able to express ourselves and being able to interpret things in different ways, is in our human nature. If we, as a race, should expect to rely on a computer to detect our emotions, humans would become robotic. The beauty of human nature is being able to see through peoples' emotions and forming different connections. Taking away any room for interpretating peoples' feelings would also take away the mystery and joy in life.

Just as nobody can read thoughts, our feelings should also be kept private. By adding a computer system that detects emotions in every classroom, students would not have the privacy they deserve. They would never learn how to live independently and this system would not prepare the students for life beyond school. Finally, the need for human interaction is constant. Humans need to be able to communicate face-to-face and have the freedom to interpret things differently. This open communication is what creates bonds and friendships between people. Without it, humans would not be able to enjoy life.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
41C6D3432C49,"Can you see the emotions in the Mona Lisa? A latest technology that can recognize emotions was the latest innovation from Prof. This technology claims it has the ability to read every emotion, even in pictures. Is this a reliable technology or is this something that isnt exact?

The recent technology on seeing emotions talks about how the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. How can we know if this is true because we were not there to tell what her emotions where. Yes you can see some emotion in her painting, because it states that Da Vinci studied the human anatomy so that it would help him with painting facial muslces precisely to show emotion.

This technology can be good for some purposes. Dr. Huang makes a statement saying, ""A classroom computer could tell when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human structor."" This is a good factor, because this can help students with school so theyre not falling behind.

Overall this technology may have some pros, and it has some cons. If you put it to good use like for instince helping kids when theyre confused or bored it will show them other ways which is good. Then you have your cons. This technology might not always be precise and at some point this could lead to problems when trying to solve a serious situation. This technology is realiable at some points, theyre are multiple ways it can help and then there can be some disfunctions. Every technology has their flaws though.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
8B882092B4A7,"The technology fro read the emotionals expressions, its something aswesome. For example, in the articule is used the picture of the Mona Lisa, because this is a great example, she has detected many different emotions in her smile, something like, stay happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. She have many emotions in her face, can be change her smile.

""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.""

In this articule explain us how the computers now can check one smile and know if is a fake smile or a real smile. In conclusion, the computer now encode different emotions if write down some simple instructions. This help us for can know if the Mona Lisa is smiling or had another emotion in her face.

95FE7FC98A67,The new technology called Facial Action Coding System should should be used in a classroom to read the emotional expressions of the students. Why? you make ask. I belive it will actually rise the students smartness and test scores. Also it would be the best for years to come! It will hepl the students more smart becasue in classroom there are kids that are to scared/embrassed to rise their hand and ask questions. So if the teacher see a student is confused and sees that kid is to sacred to rise their hand then he would rexplain what he was teaching. Then if the technology shows he or she isnt confused then he would move on. This will be so great years to come because kids wouldn´t be left behind and wouldn´t feel that they have to drop out. If they will see their selfs being something big in the futer. Then we will have more doctors and mostly likely to find new medinces for illness like cancer. We will get sincetes to help us live in this earth longer and maybe hopefully keep the earth clean. They would be smart enugh to find new ways to keep the earth clean. Not even just to help the eart but help kids prevent from doing things that will harm themselfs and others. For an exmaple if the teacher sees somoene is so mad they can try to help and talk and that could help a school shooting because sometimes all we need to someone to talk to. So in conclusen i belive the new technology called Facial Action Coding System should be in the classroom because it will help the earth and thw world but mot imporantly us humans.,2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
23A195AB438D,"I believe that the use of this technology would be valuable to use in a classroom full of students. I believe this because instructors must know what their students emotions are like toward the subject being taught. For example, let's say a students emotion is bored, the taecher would then know what his students emotion is like. The instructor may be able to give a 2 to 5 minute survey to his students based on what he can do to improve his teaching skills. Which would therefor give his students a better environment to work.

The prompt explained a somewhat new computer software that could recognize emotions. It explains what the software can do and how it works. 'The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscle. Movement of one or more muscle is called an ""action unit.""'(D'Alto), this quote talks about how it reads ones face emotion. Which brings us to a students emotion and how its read. This is where it is valuable, 'But if you frown, the next ad will be different. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming counfused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human insstructor.'(D'Alto). This is where it is valuable this software, it will be able to tell an instructor their students emotion toward the subject and how they'll be able to improve/modify the lesson.

With this software many instructors would be able to improve on their lessons. Thanks to Prof. Thomas Huang and his colleage many students would be able to focus on their lesson and not be bored again. This is why I believe this technology would be a valuable use in a classroom full of students.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
072BF1F05F66,"According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world. The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it would allow teachers to know when students become confused, are being dishonest, or are depressed and possibly having problems at home.

In the classroom, it is common for students to tend to get confused while being taught a lesson. It is also common for students to get bored and become uninterested in the lesson at hand. With the Facial Action Coding System, teachers can make sure that their students are acquiring the best education possible and absorbing all of the material. Teachers can adapt their teaching style according to how students respond to the lesson being taught. This way, both the students and teachers can be on the same page, making education easier for students and teachers. The article states,""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'"" (D'Alto). In this quote, Dr. Huang is telling the reader how this new technology could possibly develop into something much bigger where it can modify the lesson for students who become bored or confused, making it an easier and better experience for the student.

School behavior is a big part of a students education. If a student is constantly acting out and misbehaving it could affect his or her education pretty badly. Although, that is why Facial Action Coding Systems could also be very useful in a classroom environment. The technology could be able to detect if a student is being dishonest, which could prove very handy when dealing with situations with delinquents and trouble-makers. In the excerpt, the author writes, ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful,"" (D'Alto). In this quote, the author tells the reader about some facial muscle clues that allow experts to tell if a famous figure is being dishonest. These are some of the same facial clues the FACS looks for.

Finally, The FACS could help find if students are depressed or having problems at home. The machine can detect six different emotions, including sadness. This could prove useful when dealing with distressed students. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (D'Alto). This quotes tells the reader about the emotions the machine can read.

915EC7748175,"I belive that the FACS technology would be valuable. I think that it would be valuable because it can probably tell if a student is cheating or if the student is tired.

The Facial Action Coding System would allow the computer to track the users face. It would allow the computer to know if the student is cheating seeing if the user is smiling a little. It would alse be able to see it the user is tired or bored. If the user (or student) was tired or bored could tell the computer to switch it up a little bit and try to make whatever they are doing a little bit funner.

The text states that if you see an ad on your screen and you smile it will show you a ad just like that one. If you frown when you see that ad it will show you a conpletely differnet one.

That is just a couple of thing the FACS can do. So that is why I belive that it would be valuable.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
0C44D7D7F0FD,"A new type technology was invented called Facil Action Coding System, this enables computers to identify human emotions. We have 44 major muscles in our face and by using a 3-D computer model it will help the computer better see your emotions. It's belived that by using computer codes to help see emotions can help at school. It could also help us with our personal life.

Psychologist Dr. Paul Eckman creator of FACS had six major emotions. '' Movement of one or more muscels is called an ''action unit''. The six major emotions are happy,surprise,anger,disdust,fear,and sadnees. When you are feeling sad, your face muscels change and when the computer see that change they know u are feeling sad.

When you are on the computer and your computer knows that you dont like an ad it will change to something differnt.''A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.''. This can help the teacher by helping sudents or pick up the pace so students dont get bored or confused. And most comunacation is non-verbal and by emotions.

This tecnology can also help us with our personal life as well as school. We can usually see if one of our friend is happy or sad we do this every day. So why do we need a computer to this for us. Well if we dont know the person we mught say something wrong. And with the help of tecnology we can better understand it. BY making the a little move on how you feel it can change your emotion.

The theory of emotions states that just smiling makes you happy and changes your whole mood.

The Facial Action Coding System should be used to read students' emotional expressions because it could help them with their work if they do not inderstand something and the teacher cannot make it any easier for the student.

While others think that this new technology is a bad idea, others think it is a good idea. The text states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... It could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This proves that this technology could help students with their school work if they did not understand it.

Others say that the new technology coul dbe used to make computer animated characters more expressive. The article states, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-- for video games and for video surgery."" This proves that this technology can make people happier by just making others smile.

The Facial Action Coding System should be allowed in school and other public places. It would help people understand what everyone else is feeling and if they need someone to comfort them. The new technology should be allowed to make others around them happier then they were earlier. It will make everyone's life easiler because then they will not have to hold in their feelings and they can just talk to the people they feel they can trust.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
20E320AA966E,"Imagine a classroom specifically tailored to each individual student and their emotion. The students there enjoy coming to school. If they are bored, the lesson changes to regain their interest. If they are confused, the lesson uses a different method of explaining to help them better understand what is being taught. The article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" describes a new emotion-recognition software that could do just that. The use of technology to read emotion is valuable and should be used classrooms.

The technology that is used currently in schools could be bettered using this new software. Throughout the United States, many schools are looking for solutions to better their classrooms. Emotion-recognition could be the answer. Most schools already have devices in place such as lap-tops, iPads, and classroom computers. With technology already in schools, why not strive to make it better? The only step that would need to be taken is putting these softwares in place.

Students could have more enjoyment and better understanding in schools with emotion detecting softwares. Those who find it hard to pay attention could recieve lessons that are constantly changing. Students that are having a difficult time with a particular portion or subject could recieve help. Even those who are commonly bored in school could be given more challanging lessons to keep their interest up, simply through emotion-recognition.

With happier kids and more personalized instruction, student's success in school could increase. If children had a more positive experience in school, they could enjoy learning more. If students enjoyed learning more, they might have more motivation to do well in school. Also, each individual student would be given instruction tailored to them, so no student would be left behind or have less oportunity to succeed than others.

Overall, the use of emotion detecting technology is valuable and should be used in classrooms. Technology is already being used in schools, so all that would have to be done is putting the new software in place. Increases in student enjoyment while at school could greatly effect the levels of student success, leading to a smarter generation of motivated and positive individuals.

The system has six basic emotions-happiness, surpise, anger, disgust fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characeteristic movements of the facial muscles.

The process begines when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.

The argument talks about if the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable or not. The technology will idnetify what the students behavior is like. If a student doesn't want to show what they are feeling, the technology will solve it out. Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions. Whoever thought that making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.

I think this technology is not valuable in a student's classroom. The student's emotional expressions will be easy to find out what they are feeling because it's in person. Mona Lisa painting needed the technolgy because no one knows what she is feeling like. This technology will be good use for paintings, pictures, etc, that it can't be expressed. The technology should only be used for educational purposes, not to find out what the student is feeling in daily. It is easy to see a genunie smile and a fake one.

This ties into the new software, the Facial Action Coding System. This software analyzes your face and can tell you how much percent happiness, anger, sadness, fear, suprise, or even disgusted you are displaying. Since we already have facial recognition, why not have the software to tell you your mood. This software would benefit education and provide a safer area for students through recognizing extreme signs of depression or anger.

Our mood can either help or damage our learning processes in school. If you are in a bad mood, you will not care as much as you would if you were happy. This software would be very benificial for any classroom. Having this software could help students learn. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Huand predicts. Then, the software could modify the lesson to suite the students need. This software could boost the students grades, because the students would be more focused or not get confused due to the Facial Action Coding System. Not only will the software boost the students education, it could also help the school identify if someone is extremely depressed or angry. This software could prevent anything drastic from occurring. It could prevent suicide, shootings, fights and all sorts of things. It could save someones life, if not many peoples lives.

Overall, the Facial Action Coding System can benefit our education and learning processes in numerous ways. It can recognize when a student is confused, and then it could modify the lesson to help the student understand the topic. It could also recognize when a student is bored, and then modify the lesson to be more interesting. It could improve the school's awareness to when a student is extremely depressed. It could also improve the school's awareness to when a student is extremely angry. The shool could then help the students who are depressed or angry to prevent anything drastic from happening.

Just one example of this technology is emotion recognition technology in which a computer can identify one's emotions from only his face. For example, Thomas Huang used this Facial Action Coding System to read the emotions of Mona Lisa, a famous painting by Leonardo da Vinci. Experts are beginning to realize that this technology, Facial Action Coding System, could result in great advancements in the classroom. But will it really have great benefits in the classroom? I believe that there could be some tremendous problems with this new technology; but if it is used properly, it could have far greater results. Although there are some dangers involved, the Facial Action Coding System has great potential value for the classroom.

The Facial Action Coding System could become a valuable tool someday in classrooms around the globe. But before looking at the great value that this tool could potentially bring, we must look at the harm that it could cause. One-on-one individual contact is vital to a child's education. Whether at home or in a classroom, a student needs an individual present in order to best teach him the concepts necessary for learning. If the computer begins to replace the teacher, then this Facial Action Coding System is no longer a benefit to the student, but rather a harm. On the bright side, however, the Facial Action Coding System does bring large benefits. Most importantly, it engages the student. Doctor Huang, innovator of this Facial Action Coding System said that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" It would then recognize that it needed to better explain the topic or rather grab the learner's attention. This could greatly benefit the academic world. Students could be taught individually, at their own pace, and possibly even in their own way. Those more advanced could move on to more advanced subjects, while those struggling could receive the help they need.

Facial Action Coding System, a wonder to us all, could greatly affect today's world, but it must be used with wisdom. It does not replace the teacher, but rather aids the teacher in teaching. Teachers are still tremendously needed for our students, and their personal mentoring is still of priceless value. Yet, along with these great blessings, the Facial Action Coding System could be added to better improve our academic world. The world needs educated men and women, and this Facial Action Coding System, innovated by Professor Thomas Huang, could be the exact element needed better educate our students, and make for a brighter future.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

On the Facial Action Coding System would not be bad if you could shut it off and on other then it being on non stop all day tring to read your face.

The Facial Action Coding Systm would be cool if the creater could make it read other creachers like cat or a dog for we could see how they feel. cats wag there tail but my cat is happy when he wags his tail what dose that mean than?

My dog growls when he vplays what dose it mean? Maby later on they can move on from human faces to other animal faces.

Dr. Paul Eckter man has alot of good idals with his program. He just needs it were the people can turn it on and off othere than being on all the time. like how when some people are angry they turn tv on or funny videos. That could turnout to becume disaster.

The Facial Action Coding System is a good idal for school work for if the student would get bord it could change there studing ways up or class room asiments. The program could read diffent shown emotions in the program. In fact us human perform the same impresive caculation every day.

Also another plus is it could show students themselves something they may be interested in which they didn't know even themselves.

First of all, it would show teachers the understandment level of students to a certain topic or subject, so if there is a subject or topic in which kids faces were scanned for their feelings about that subject, the teacher could maybe improve or make the lesson easier for students, which overall would create a better education system for the sutudents in the class and better oppurtunity. The second reason as to why it would be valuable to have the facial action coding system int he classroom would be because it would show students and teachers levels of interest kids may have on a certain subject or topic. For example say there are kids in a class and they begin there science notes or studies etc., and some kids have more higher interest feelings than others on the topic, that can show both teachers and even students what they truly feel about science, and it can lead to helping kids making bigger decisions in their lives, such as whether or not they want to pursue a career with lots of science involved or not. The third reason to use facial action coding system would be because it is universal. From the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", it is said that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" The facial expressions for each emotion being universal means that anyone from anywhere around the world can use this as a tool to help them succeed in school, no matter what ethnicity they are from, and if they look different. Also if this facial action coding system is universal, imagine how accurate it is. So it definetely would be valuable to classroom setitngs all around the world, and would creat greater oppurtunites for students to get a better education.

To conclude, the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable to a classroom setting because it shows understandment, shows interest, and is universal which could also mean it is extremely accurate and enhanced. The Facial Action Coding system has many benefits to it which would be a great help to teachers in a classroom as well. The Facial Action Coding System could be used as a tool to succeed to many around the world. And so overall, the Facial Action Coding System is great and would be extremely valuable to classroom settings. ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
30D7FD691AE3,"As technology develops more, we need to consider what is valueable and what should be left behind. The Facial Action Coding System would be beneficial to read students' emotional expressions. Being able to adjust or identify how a student is feeling might prove to be invalueable.

Boredom is a very common feeling in school. It disengages students, stopping them from participating and paying attention all together.

According to the article A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. Technology continues to play a more prominent role in education, this technology could help every student learn and stay interested. Identifying what the student is feeling could make crucial adjustments to the learning plan and the students would be better off for it.

This technology could be valuable for students in a non-academic way. Teachers being able to understand what a student is feeling could be life-saving. People experience problems of different kinds every single day. In paragraph seven the article states, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" A teacher identifying that there is a problem with a student would allow them to talk with that student who might be going through a hard time in there life and provide some relief to a student who might feel burdened or stressed.

This technology would be very valueable in the classroom. Being able to adjust a lesson plan could help students stay engaged and understand the material better. Identifying sadness or any other negative emotion could help with any problems someone might be experiencing at home.

I think that if you want to find out your emotions, you're pretty weird from my point of view. You should know how you feel, not letting a computer or any other technology ran device to find out your emotions. If you don't know your emotions that's because you have mixed thoughts. Your facial expression that you show to people as you walk around should tell them how you feel, for instance; looking upset shows many emotions, smiling could mean you're happy or just faking it because you're actually really depressed and don't want anyone to know. This technology that people are creating just to do that is a waste of time. Do something different, don't focus on something that people may not really even use. There are more reasons on way I am against it because all it did was just show a painting's emotions.

But what if there was a software that allowed a chance to put the individual infront of a camera and the thought of guessing was no longer an option, because all the answers are sitting on the screen? Professor Thomas Huang from Beckman Institute has created such a software, a software that has the ability to calculate someone's emotions much like in math class. This new software can open doors for the future, and give us new advancements in the classroom, but could it be an end to simply asking if some is okay? Could this be the end to emotional privacy, or simply emotions?

The new software, the Facial Action Coding System, has many promising attributes and the ability to open new doors for technology and learning environements in the future. It being able to calculate emotions as easily as math problems, could help us decode a lot of the mystery that is the human mind. The process starts wiht a 3-D computer model of the face, and contains information of all the 44 major muscles in a human face and with the help of psychologists, it can classify six emotions and associate them with movements of facial muscles. This type of technology has the ability to be used in a classroom to watch when a student is getting bored or tired to help the teacher better themselves when teaching. Or maybe even help in real world situations when someone goes in front of a jury, or even during interviews for a job. But how accurate is this new software, and how do we know we can rely on it?

The Facial Action Coding System is seemly flawless with many positive outlooks on what is instore for us in the futrue, but has two big questions sitting on its shoulders. How can we rely on this system? And how do we know that this is even an accurate reading? When thinking about someones emotions, one thinks of the individuals emotions as diverse and extremely different from everyone elses. So how can this software accurately read individual emotions around the world? Dr. Huang says ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"", he firmly believes that his new software can identify the most mixed emotions with the use of video imagery and emotion recognition. This however, still does not provide us with a good example of how we can be sure that this is a reliable way to read someones emotions and could potetially ruin human socialization and emotions toward one another.

While this new software may seem like the ""next big thing"", there are many ways that this could potentially ruin the human race. Society right now is circling around the phone, it is how we communicate, have a social life, and figure things out. It is in our way of life and we have adapted to the idea of constantly having a phone at our beck and call. So why not add in another way of relying on technology, but this one can help us figure out someones emotions, since simply asking ""Are you okay?"" is too hard and time consuming. Why not just stick them in front of a camera to have it tell them how they are feeling instead of trying to listen to how they feel and talking with one another. This new Facial Action Coding System has the ability to open many new doors, but it could close the door for human socialization.

The Facial Action Coding System is an advancement in technology and has the abilities to open and grow our future. It had the ability to help out in classroom environments and give more support during other real life situations. But with it can come the destruction of human socialization and emotions and make a total mess of how we interact with each other. While trying to figure out someones emotions is very difficult and challenging, it may be better to stick with such ways rather than completly giving up what makes us human and causing a catastrophe in the human world.

27E904ED6981,"Imagine if you could realize your friends emotions all the time. Facial Action Coding Systems might be our new way to know how someone is feeling. New software is being developed to better comunicate emotions. What if we had this technology in schools? To better understand our peers and know if they are okay. This would be a tremendous advance in schools nowadays.

If we had this technology in school teachers could better understand their students. Teachers could find out how the student are feeling and adjust according to what the students are thinking. This machine would help classrooms everywhere because if a student is board of the lesson odds are they are not going to pay attention. A student is not always willing to talk to a teacher and tell them why they are not doing well or what they dont like about class. You cant always be perfect at guessing how someone is feeling by what you see because they could be hiding their emotions from you. People would think that the machine would not work right and it would be false information being read. The machine is constructed by callibrating it to recognize all 44 major muscles in the model to move exactly like humans move. The machine has six basic emotions happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness. And along with the characteristics are movements of the facial muscles. Each one of the emotions are designed to be read of human facial movements to detect emotion. All the steps to constucting this machine are great and are taken off of human facial movement.

Facial Action Coding machines could help teachers and staff stop suicidal thought or actions from occuring. Teachers are at school to help students and just the regular teacher dosen't always catch a student having a horrible day or getting bullied constantly. This machine could help teachers find the kids that are having it rough and sit down with them and talk. This machine would take away the amount of suicidal thoughts and even suicide at high schools all across the country.

This machine would help in many different catigories. If teachers started using this machine and making kids feel better everyday it would make students want to come back to school and want to learn. This would increase grades and student to teacher bonds. The students would carry that home and that would help parents. Kids would do more choirs and help around the house more. They would stop being so hostile twords their parents. This machine could bring so much good to schools and communities all across the world.

Although this machine would be great to have in schools it could be taken as a privacy issue. Students might not feel comfortable if a teacher or elder has a machine that can read how they are feeling. This could be an issue for many parents as well. If a parent does not want this in the school their child goes to they are more than likely to take their child out of that school. This could provoke other parents as well to get the wrong idea about this machine. The parents could see this as a danger in a school because they would no nothing about the machine or the students could be frightened from this machine.

To conclude my essay I think this device would be a great thing to have in schools. It could prevent kids from being bullied, having suicidal thought or even being board in class. It would help teachers get the right idea of what to teach in class and get the idea of students that might be having a really hard time. All in all this machine would be a great tool to use in schools all across the world.",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8
5ACC26FF2398,"Identifying Human Emotions

Imagine being able to figure out exactly how anyone in this world are feeling with just a computer. Now software has developed that could help you do just that. The Fcial Action Coding System has applications that will be extraordinary to modern day technology.

Dr. Huang and Dr. Eckman created the the FACS. All which have six emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These are emotions that are used on a daily basis around the world so they are pretty basic. Video imagery is used that tracks one's facial movements. Therefore it can identify mixed emotions. The video imagery compares each expression with a neutral face in order to figure your emotions.

Imagine being at school on your classroom computer learning something boring, and all of a sudden the topic becomes fun. Dr. Huang predicts that your classroom computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored. It would be useful to many students in order to make and help them learn better. This same technology could make identifying emotions much easier. The boring lesson for you would modify. This way the computer will know to keep giving you boring lessons or fun ones.

Facial muscles are obviously an important item in this. If the technology could not identify the way your facial muscles move, then the technology would not work. Not only do your muscles express emotion, but they also help produce them. The article states that a renowned drama coach, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emotions on stage. This clearly would help the actors express themselves better, thanks to our face muscles. People may not notice, but we imitate other people's facial expressions with empathy.

Who would have thought that sience and technology could be involved with a big feature of who we are. Sometimes being able to figure how someone is feeling. At times we may even have to bug them in order to figure the emotion. Now with the new technology of FACS, this task will be easier. Even for students in a classroom, this will be valuable.               ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

For instance, you can problably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect. Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code."" This shows that most people do not know the specific traits that describe the emotion but most people also know that when their friend or family memeber makes a certain facial expresion that they are either happy, sad, mad, or even annoyed.

People can figure things out without needing a machine to do things for them. Maybe for paintings the FACS can be useful but not on ordinary people who know when their friend is feeling down or not. People do not need technology to do everything for them.

Sometimes humans can show many emtions and we might not know whet they are for example there ar ethe simple emtions such is happy, excited, sad, anger, but then there are other emmtions where it might be mixed like happy but sad or angry and sad and sometimes emtions we might not even know what they are and that when the Facs comes in to see what emtion someone might be feeling. There can also be a hiddin emtion within someone when someone might seem happy they might show it on the outside but in the inside they are probly feeling another emotion. One way Facs can be very helpful is by knowing wether that person is going thru some stuff for example a person could be thinking about commiting suicide but nobody would know until their facial expression shows that and it might not be a sad facial expression it could be a diffrent one but with the Facs it would be able to tell someone right away what emotion they are feeling.

Well being all about the new technology will tell you a lot about your self. Being about the technology will tell you about facial expressions, how the muscles in your face can tell how you really feel, and how the technology works for people. This technology will tell how a person really feels.

Facial expressions can tell a lot about a person and how they might feel. When someone is frowning others may think that your mad or sad. But when someone is smiling others may think that they are happy or excitied. Facial expressions can tell a lot about people but noone really knows what the true facial expresson is. When a person is happy they might simle, when a person is scared they might make a frightened facial expression. Each facial expression means something different.""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"", ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."".

Muscles on your face tell what expression a person is using. Someone who is smiling muscles are shaped different from when they are sad or mad. Depending on how you feel is the way your muscles are shaped. ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above our eyes) raises your eyebrows when your surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."", said Dr. Paul Eckman.

You may be wondering how this technology works and what it really does. Well ""this process begins when the vcomputer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."". ""Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit.."". "" There are six basic emotions- happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fera, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristics movements of the facial muscles."" By weighting different units, the software can even indentify mixed emotions, meaning that the weight of it can tell. Each one of the expressions that are used are compared to neutral faces.

Imagine if a computer can tell weather your confused or mad or even sad. What if when it could tell what facial expression you was meaning it woud change to your intrest. This technology could help a lot of people. For an example it could help school kids become more intrested in school work if it could tell you was bored and made it more intresting.

I think this because sometimes its important to know someones emotion, and if they are faking or lying. This technolgy could be helpful for people to indicate wheather they need help or not. I also think that tis technology could help save lives too. I'll explain why.

First reason on why this technology is valuble is because it can be used in the classroom to know wheather a student is confused on the lesson or not. A shy student sometimes wouldnt want to ask for help about the lesson. So using this technology for would be very useful because teachers would now know who and who needs help. It could also help teacher to know if a student is angry, sad, etc to know how to help them. That one reason why I think this techonolgy is useful.

Another reason why emotion reading technology is useful because in paragraph 8 the article stated "" to an expert, faces dont lie; these muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politcian or celebrity isnt being truthful"". This means now we could know if a leader is being real or not. It could help with votes during an election to choose the correct politician. Not only that but in genral to knoe if people are lying or not.

last reason why I think the use of this technology is valuable is because it can save peoples lives. using this technolgy would let you know how a person is feeling. If a person is depressed and on the edge of doing something that they shouldnt , using this emtion reading technology could alert people on how others can be feeling very down and thode people could help them.

The machines gather information about us to make our lives easier. Most of the times, it's a good thing. They help us by reminding us of things and let us connect to the rest of the world with just a few keystrokes. However, this FACS, would have a major impact in the school system. It would be a terrible decision to implement FACS into the school system.

Don't get me wrong, I love technology. It's improved and become what many consider just a dream. It always us to do many things that we could not do physically. I'd go as far to say that they're smarter than us in a few ways. They give results and they learn more and more about us. To some, that's concerning. To think that machines are secretly learning about human behavior and plotting plans to take care of the world. Most don't care or don't mind. Either way, people have different views on this.

Which brings me to my new point, implimentation of the Facial Action Coding System in schools. The Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, is a profiler. Profilers monitor how a subject works, thinks, acts, and even feels. Scary, huh? Put that into a school system and you may just have found treasure trove of blackmail. Now, I know what some will say. ""This system will help us help the students"", or ""FACS will help decrease school shootings"". Those individuals make good points, but there's one thing you have to consider. Human behavior. People don't just cough up how they feel most of the time. To have an eye watching them and judging them will only make them hate it more. It may make people feel worse off than they originally were.

I'll end with this. Yes, the system could be beneficial, as long as it's in the right hands. Privacy is a critical part of people's lives and most like it not to be broken into.

39D95DDBDD5D,"The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The problem with this is that not all classrooms have computers. This new technology would only get used every time computers are used, so the FACS wouldn't get much use. That is why I think this technology is not very valuable in a classroom.

The article states in paragraph one that FACS was developed to help humans and computers communicate. Then, in paragraph five, the article says that humans read each other's facial expressions all the time. I do not think that humans need computers to read each other's emotions if we already do it so well.

Another point to my argument is that the computer may not be able to read people's correct emotions. For example, there is no definite way of knowing Mona Lisa's emotions in her painting. Just because a computer says what her emotions are, doesn't mean that it is right. She may have been happy, she may have been faking; we simply have no way of knowing for sure.

The last point to my argument is using technology to read our emotions. Most teachers don't allow students to use electronics in the classroom. In paragraph six, Dr. Huang says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"". To me, a student's learning is more important than them being entertained. Now, being confused is an entirely different thing. If a student is confused they should ask the teacher to explain so that they do understand.

I think this technology is not very valuable in a classroom. My biggest issue with this is the tech being faulty. If humans can read each other's emotions without much difficulty, I don't see why computers need to be able to read them as well. I don't see how that benefits anyone.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
909F92280E04,"Have you ever been so confused when it comes to reading and understanding a person that you just ultimately cannot? A new technology system has been released to give exact percentages of a persons emotions just by looking into a camera. The Facial Action Coding System was designed to decode by using ""some new computer software that can recognize human emotions"" (1). The test subject, the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da VInci, has answered many questions when it comes to what she is expressing. The FACS can be valuable in classrooms because it can help with the studies of human anatomy or psychology, and it can help others understand each other.

Calculating another persons emotions can help with understanding human anatomy and psychology classes at schools. For this software, human anatomy has a major role and ""stores similar anatomical informtaion as electronic code"" (5). The research going along with this system shows there are ""action units"" within facial structure that signifies the movement of one or more muscles. Each of the six basic emotions that Dr. Paul Eckman has classified are all associated with the facial muscles. It is important for students to know these muscles and learn how they work. According to Eckman, ""your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises eyebrows when you're surprised"" and the ""orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger"" (3). This up-to-speed technology comes up with information that no human could, but helps students become knowledgable of how it works. Society is based on technology as of right now, and is the forefront of the younger generations, so this software should partake in a students learning.

Emotions are something that are unbelievably hard to understand when coming from other people. One typically cannot tell how a person is feeling just by the way they are looking, unless they are close with them personally. Being able to understand someone's emotions will benefit them and their surroundings, as they can get help if they are down or can have reassurance if they think someone is mad at them. Students can become more aware of each other and can give more support to their peers. With a program like this, the most accurate percentages are provided, giving a description of how the person feels. In the Mona Lisa for example, she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" (1). What other technology can get those numbers? The more understandment of each other that is within society is valuable and can potentially create peace amongst us all. The reason the world is in such a bad place is because there is that confusion within each other and nobody knows how anyone truly feels. If students can grasp this concept, this entire generation can change the hatred and all come together.

As the years go by, society is becoming more and more aware of technology, making it have a greater effect on the population as a whole. In schools, technology is the greatest way of teaching and learning because curriculums can be made simpler. Technology is all that will be there eventually, so we might as well use and understand it now. The FACS can answer many questions about a person or group and how they live. The constant wonder and confusion in the world of how people feel about each other can come to an end and create peace. This can only begin with the young generations.

The facial coding system could actually be valuable to about almost anyone . IT could maybe replace therapists and or guidance counselors because the computer could read how theyre feeling and make them feel happy if theyre sad . It could very well ask them questions on how their day was or by simply giving them a compliment . I would keep testing it to make sure it wont mess up or make the users mad enough to where they break it or get mad at it and throw it down because what you want to do is make them happy.

E2A68D0D296D,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa smile :"" they have a technology called the Facial Action coding system"" , this system lets computers idenfy human emotions , this is a very valuable method . This could help students get better grades in class and it could also help the teacher know how the student is feeling so they can help them out if they are depressed or sad or even afraid .

This is a very vaulble system if a kid is afriad maybe somethig is going on at home to make them feel this way the teachers would be able to detect it and get the student the help it needs . In the article it says "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored "" this means if the student is confused the teacher would know to maybe take the lesson a little slower and help the kid out or if multiple students look confused she could maybe just go over the lesson all over again.

This system works like a math problem in the text it says "" Shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted , 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry "" You would know all the students feelings right away . Many kids do not ask questions or open up the saddest ones are always the quiet ones. Without this system the kids that have a fear of getting made fun of for rasing there hands to ask a question would never get help . Without this system the kids that are sad and depressed from who knows what would never get the help they need to over come that . Without this system kids that have the fear from maybe getting beat at home or getting bullied from the means kids on the play ground would never be healed , maybe the rate of school shootings would go down because the sad people would not be alone anymore .

This article says the computer can detect "" happiness , suprise , anger , disgust, fear and sadness "" thats 6 emotions you may never know from just looking at a kid without this technology. It says "" Then it could modify the lesson like n fffective hum instructor "" the computer would break down a lesson that a student is confused on and help them .

3EF3E5B52108,"What if the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can help students get better grades?

I think the new software that has been developed, can improve the grades/ learning of students.

The Facial Action Coding System has lots of great reasons to why it's valuable for students in a classroom.

I think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

Why, because if the students had the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) the teachers would be able to see if the student's are focusing/paying attention to what it is that they are doing.

The teacher's would be able to tell what's wrong with the student.

The student's emotions would show on the system.

I think it's a good idea, now the teacher's can read student's emotional expressions.

If the student is not getting good grades, the teacher will be able to see what it is that the student is feeling.

When the student's are feeling confused, the teacher will know.

Some student's are shy to raise their hand or even ask for help on what they are confused on or about.

"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"".

Reading the students emotional expressions, would be a specific result with the FACS (Facial Action Coding System).

Maybe you could tell hows your friend is feeling by looking at them.

But, the system would tell you their exact emotions.

Being able to see how you feel is a great for teachers.

So yes, I think the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valueable.           ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
2A906C1535A0,"Is the use of technology to read emotional expressions in the classroom valuable? Maybe. In paragraph 6 of Making Mona Lisa smile by Nick D'alto, there is reason to believe that reading the emotions of students can help focus on what students want to do, or what they enjoy in the classroom. Which will ultimately help them learn better if they're learning what they like. Artificial emotion reading is a new technology developed by Thomas Huang in the Advanced science branch at the University of Illinois, and has reached word of many schools, who are ready to fully endorse it as a form of reading the emotions students feel, to help adapt the way they are taught into a more fun and interesting way.

However, there is one clear down set to this idea, and thats that if kids need to be facially monitered to know if they enjoy the class or not, then it's probably the teachers fault. Yes reading emotions would be a cool feature to add to know if students are enjoying what they are learning, but it will probably be an expensive technology to purchase. Furtherly noted, also stated in Making Mona Lisa Smile, we don't completely communicate with each other through words, so it wouldn't exactly be an impossible thing for teachers to realize if they're being boring if they pay attention to how the students are reacting to what they are teaching. It just seems as though it is an unnecessary piece of technology that many want entered into the classroom setting.

All in all there are pros and cons to moving this piece of artificial intelligence into classrooms. Some pros would be; The ability to know how students are reacting to what they are learning, and it would help to focus on what motivates kids to do there school work. However, a few cons would be; Its not cheap, and you most likely don't need it in the classroom. Lastly, there could defenitely be legal trouble with parents not wanting there children monitored throughout the day via their mobile school device. Artifical Emotion reading is a cool idea, but honestly, not very practical, and not exactly necessary.      ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
963E8B231ED0,"Its hard reading peoples facial expressions. Some people dont have the type of face where others can take a peek at their face and know whether they are happy or upset. Life just is not that easy. Although being able to read someones facial expressions can get in a way of teaching a student, make others feel bad, and perhaps the technology can misenterpret a facial expression.

Students and teachers alike may feel highly uncomfortable knowing that technology is veiwing their face at every point of the day. Humans now live in the 20th century where technology is booming and will continue to improve. In the article it states that a computer classroom will be able to defrentiate ones emotions and change an ad to best fit the persons prefrences (""Making Mona Lisa Smile""). Thats fine and dandy until they change from ads to actual lessions. Lets say that a student is watching a class video independently as are the other students. Perhaps the video is for biology and what is being shown is a dissected frog. Of course watching a frog being dissected can make some students disgusted, but in the end of the day the student still has to learn all this since it is required in the class. Perhaps in order to achieve a good grade in the class the student has to sit through and watch that video to learn.

Having technology constantly viewing ones facial expressions can be pretty unfortunate. The technology can apparently know if someone is happy or sad (""Making Mona Lisa Smile""). If it can tell if someone is happy or sad can it tell if someone is lying? Lets say a female student asks the teacher for permission to use the restroom. Perhaps this teacher is strict and does not allow restroom passes unless necessary. Telling the teacher in front of everyone that she is on her mentrual cycle is embarrassing for younger female students; even more so if the teacher happens to be a male. Now having technology that can pinpoint the fact that this female student does not have to urinate would be classified as a lie. Therefore the teacher would say no knowing she is lying about having to pee. This of course puts the female student in a difficult position; leaving her to feel bad and embarrassed about being caught in a lie. There are two choices now she doesn't go to the restroom and risks staining hersle with blood or she tells the teacher in front of everyone that she is on her period and be embarrassed about that too. Having this technology can be greatly embarrassing for many other students too.

Technology is bound to mess up at one point. All humans and technology are not perfect. There is not such thing as perfect, so having technology that reads human expressions around may be cool until is messes up and reads ones expression incorectly. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...,"" (""Making Mona Lisa Smaile""). For exapmle if a student is intrigued by a subject and understanding what is being taught then there is no real reason for the subject to be changed. Imagone that a student sitting in class deeply engrossed in the sunject to vome to school the nect day and have to sit through a boring lession just because a computer read their expression wrong.

It is normal to be excited over new technology. People need to be level headed though and ask themselves whether or not it will be beneficient towards whatever purpose the technology is bought for. The new software Facial Action Coding System can be pretty appeasing when thinking of it at first. Actually owning it and installing it in a classroom can lead to bad consequences like: A student not learning well, making others feel bad, and the risk of the software making mistake.

CBA185D3B277,"I think that the ""Facial Action Coding System"" may actually be valuable. The machine detects emotions from using a picture and that can help with knowing how a person feels. The machine uses the muscles in your face to detect your emotions, it calulates all emotions found, and has most of the common emotions so the FACS has a very good chance of being accurate and valuable.

The machine uses the muscles in your face to detect emotions. This is useful because different muscles makes different emotions, In the article the athour explained how the machine can tell if someone was happy or not. ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" That explains that even if the person tries to change their emotion the real one will still be seen because of the muscles that they are using.

The ""Facial Action Coding System"" calulates all the emotions found in the persons face. Since the machine can calulate all the emotions it has a better chance if getting the right exact emotion the person is feeling and get all the emotions. This machine would be about to detect how any person is feeling and can show up at 6 emotions.

With the machine being able to caluate your emotions its able to detect up to 6 different emotions that people use everyday. ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. That was a discription of the Mona Lisa painting that the FACS gave. This shows how many differnt emotions she had and the machine was able to pick them all up.

The Facial Action Coding System is usefully when it comes to trying to figure out someone elses emotions. The machine uses the muscles in your face to detect your emotions, it calulates all emotions found, and has most of the common emotions so the FACS has a very good chance of being accurate and valuable.

The software to detect the emotions of students would be too expensive and that makes the Facial Action Coding System not valuable. ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile (Nick D'Alto)."" Most schools have standard home computers in class, which means the school will spend a fortune to replace the old computers with new and more powerful computers. After replacing the computers schools will still have to buy the Facial Action Coding System, which will most like cost alot of money that could be used for other things.

Another reason the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable is because it would be a distraction in a classroom. ""Empathy (feeling someone else's emotional state) may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions (Nick D'Alto)."" After being told one student's emotion the other students in that class will unconsciously feel that emotion and distracting them for their lesson.

Just like the Facial Action Coding System, this thing can be someones enemy, becasue maybe this person can be against the whole thing.

On the other hand, other people can come foward and say ""it is time for change"" and be all happy, and the next thing you know is that the world is run be robots. Change is good, but it can also lead to destruction and caos. That is why we have to be careful with what we do in future, because what we do now can harm some innocent life that didn't deserve it.

A8A8A9369A41,"People have been debating if the use of new technology should be used in the classroom; however, people have yet to decide. There are two sides to this arugment the pro side. The people who want the use of new technology and then there are them who think newer technology is not needed to learn. These people are the con side. The author Nick D'Alto made great points on how new facal technology could be helpful in the classroom.

The first way, new facal technology could help in the classroom is by showing when a student is confused and not sure whats going on. In paragraph 6 Dr. Huang states "" A classroom computer can recognoze when a student is becoming confused or cored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" As for example, of this when doing math homework online or english the computor could recoginize when the student is confused and then send the student step-by-step insturction. Also the teacher could request this imfomation on which problem the students are confused on and go over them into more detailed.

The second reason, as to why we should use facial technology is for students who are intrested into coding and computer-animations. Students can learn how to make video games charactaers more expressive. As in paragraph 6, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive- for video games or video suregery"" This could help when student is taking and computer-animation class and is very intrested into becoming an coder. When making these games the more detail and expresstion the animators can put into these games the more infomation they need. This program can help provide that kind of knowleage.

On the other hand, yes this new facial technology is not nessary. People often say teacher can read their students facial expersstions just fine without technology; however, an teacher might just over look it or not be able to tell what the student is feeling. This new facial technology can track facial movements and identify mixed emotions. The teacher could also access this and use it to help their students for the better.

Should schools allow new facial technology in classrooms? That what has been decussed in passed years. If they do allow them in classrooms it could help students when they use work online. When the computer detects a student is confused or having trouble they could send out helpful work. Or when a student is intrested in computer animation, the computer could have facial expresstions and detailed know how to make these possible on the computer. Schools should allow these in their classrooms not only for students but for teachers also.         ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

D926CCFBB6E4,"Ding! Ding! Ding! The bell has now rung and you must take your seat. Class is beginning. Here goes another day of zoning out and being bored for seven hours!

New software has been developed, the Facial Action Coding System, and it can detect your emotions. The Facial Action Coding System being in the classroom would be very valuable!

This technology being in classrooms would be beneficial for many reasons. In the passage Dr. Huang predicts,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows how the Facial Action Coding system could help the students learn. By being able to know if the student is not understanding or getting bored, the computer can now review what the student is confused about and make a different approach on how they are giving the student information.

Knowing what people's emotions are is very important when it comes to communicating and teaching them new things. In the text Dr. Huang says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that too."" This shows that because of emotion's being a big part of communicating and understanding things, computers should know what people are feeling as well. This will make computers even more helpful than they already are. In addition, the computers won't have a hard time being able to recognize these emotions! According to the article,""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."" This shows how even though many people show their emotions in different ways, your face muscles do similar things for you to be able to tell each expression. The passage also says,"" They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forces smile."" This proves how the software is really aware of how you're feeling.

All of this can show why the Facial Action Coding System would be very valuable in the classroom. Hopefully now you would like this new software in classrooms at your own school! Ding! Ding! Ding!

Well with technologies like Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman's FACS or Facial Action Coding System, that is quite possible. With a technology that is able to read and recognise facial expressions, it can help improve students online lectures and help them pay attention and focus. A technoloy like FACS that can read emotions through facial msucle movment would provide the education system with a better way to connect to the students and aid in their emotional focus to the lectures and assignments providing a valuable aid to student education.

Even though humans can already perform similar actions, being able to tell what those around you are feeling by looking at their face. Humans can only ""calculate"" how such individuals are feeling and many fail to get a appropriate calculation. As Dr. Huang notes, "" most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" so for a computer to be able to read nonverbal expressions is very helpful as most students are kept to themselves. A computer with the FACS tecnonly would be able to recongize a studetns needs when learning on line. As Dr. Huang states, "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored [allowing the computer] to modity the lesson."" This ability to recognize emotions through facial movment can help improve the students performance by modifying lessosn to meet their educational needs. As some students already have trouble focusing in class and loose attetnion when lessons are boring or they just simply don't understand. Technologies like FACS provide the students with an adaptive and responsive system that will help them improve their focus and learn more affectively.

On the other hand some people may argue that technologies like FACS are an invasion of privacy. Or that these technologies can not really tell your emotions. These technologie dont do anything millions and millions of people do not already do everyday, read facial expression. The is what tecnologies like FACS do they read and recognize facial movments to determine emotion. Just like all of us do when trying to figure out the feelings of those around us. These techonlogies use a complex level of facial recognition invented and tested by proffesionals like Dr. Huang. As well as Dr. Paul Eckman who studies anatomatical movments and sturcutres. Being able to classify six basic emotions those being, "" happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"". Even though these six can not analyzse every single emotion it will analyzse the one expressed the most.

Allowing those around, like teachers and instructures to aid in figuring out what is wrong with an individual and how to help them perform better.

So overall technologies like FACS which are able to read facial muslce movments are benefitail to student learing. A technoloy capable of adapting to analysed human emotion will help studnets learn , focus and feel more attented to in their learning. By identifying the emotion these technologies can also help teachers and guidecne counselors work towards aiding those students which are emotinally depressed and need help but wont verbally say it. Such technologies not only offer a way to aid and improve student attention in learning but also help those students who hide their emotional prolems, which affect their learning by having teacehrs and counselors provide that help thanks to technologies that can read emotional expressiosn ",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8

Hard times, and the feelings that come with them should not be spread out for your peers to see. I disagree with the Facial Action Coding System. Kids and young adults should be able to hide their emotions becuase not everyone deserves to know how they feel.

Everyone has different feelings. Some negative, some posotive. If you are in class and your mom calls informing you that a loved one has been seriously injured and they are in critical condition, the feelings you have at that moment belong to you and only you. If you are in class and the coding system says that you are feeling 90 percent sad and 10 percent fearful, your classmates are ging to attack you with questions that could possibly worsen your mental state.

I understand that the system could increase test scores and grade averages, but the one thing that means the most is your security. Teachers' lives would be much easier due to the fact that they know which students need help and which students are soaking up the lesson well. There is just one problem. People (especially the youth) are insocure. Privacy is very important in this world and I believe the Facial Action Coding System would snatch that away from us.

C035045D2327,"I do not think that the Facial Action Coding System is valuable when using it to read students' emotions. I have many reasons why I am against this new technology. I believe that unless a person wants to share his or her emotions then nobody else has any business knowing what that person is feeling. My three main reasons why I am against this are because some people hide their emotions because they don't want other people to know about them, emotions are personal, and this new technology will invade the privacy of people.

Fist of all, I will be talking about my first reason that I am against the Facial Action Coding System. I am against it because some people hide their emotions so that way other people don't see them. Many people in the world like to keep their emotions to themselves. They do not like others to know how they feel, but with the new software it will be almost impossible for people to keep the emotions to themselves. In the caption underneath the picture of Mona Lisa, there is a sentence that says, ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" That sentence explains that this new software will be able to tell exactly how a person feels. No matter how hard the person is trying to hide their feelings they will no longer be able to fool anyone because of the Facial Action Coding System.

Second of all, I will talk about my second reason why I am against this new software. The second reason why I am against this software is because emotions are personal. They are not to be put out in the open all the time. When someone is experiencing negative emotions he or she may want to keep those personal feelings private. Paragraph 7 and 8 state that the face uses different muscles when fake smiling and real smiling. If a person is not happy and uses a fake smile then he/she is most likely indicating that he/she does not want to share his/her emotions with another individual. This software can detect which musles in the mouth are being used when smiling. This means that fake smiles will no longer fool someone who uses this software.

Last of all, I will be taking about my final reason that I am against this technology. This technology is an invasion of privacy towards people. The caption underneath the picture states that this software can detect exactly how a person is feeling. Imagine if this techonolgy was used on a student who had a lot a personal and private things going on in his/her life that made him/her not want to talk about his/her emotions, but then comes along a new software that can detect the emotions of a person. If this is used on that student then that student's private and personal emotions were just uncovered. What if that student didn't want people to know? It's too late now and that student feels worse because he or she did not want them to be known. Emotions and feelings will be detected without that person's consent too.

In my opinion, this new technology is not valuable when it is used to read the emotions of students in a classroom setting. I do not think that it should ever be used on a student, child, or even an adult. If a person feels that he/she wants to share the emotions he/she is feeling then he/she will tell someone.

This technology could be what schools need to keep their students awake and interacting. In the passage Dr. Huang says "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". If a computer could predict when a student was bored or confused and do something to change that it would change the amount of people who actually learn something drastically.

346078C1BCA3,"Hello readers my name is PROPER_NAME and, today I'm gonna dicuss the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System created by Dr. Paul Eckman that enables computers to indentify human emotions. Also I'm gonna support this claim about the new human emotions technology,and I'm gonna use details from the story to back up this claim so you readers know ""this new"" technology is legit. So now let's get to it shall we you readers out there.

A Renaissance painting by artist Leonardo da Vinci called Mona Lisa was studied by a scientist named Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois who innovated some new computer software that can recognize human emtions, working alongside with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr Huang and his colleague were developing a better way for humans and humans to communicate with each other.I agree with this claim, you wanna why? Because technlogy in general has come a long way, and the fact it's taken to the next step is phenomenal. Like it might be a chance that a computer software can determine how we feel and not just humans in genreal, but even old paintings so long ago isn't that incredible. But in part of the story i feel like tihs software could actually work out was that it said that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one oe more muscles is an ""action unit."" which means that they need to scan the face of a human like features in order to scan the face. When works on thigns like this he normally relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, he is the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). Edwin has classified six emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the muscles. For instance when you raise your eyebrows you're surprised, but when you raise your eyebrows down by your mouth you're angry.

Another good reason why i think this technology is really good and it can help is.That when facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression. Use videp imagery, the new emotion-recogntion software tracks these facial movements- from a real face such as Mona Lisa. If u weigh the different units' the software can even identify mixed emotions. So cool that just shows you how advanced technology can be. Also each expression is cmpared against a neutral face.

My final defense to back this claim up is that computers got so advanced over the years it's kinda like it knows who to set up your mood of what you wanna see. For instance, if you smile when a Web ad appears on oyur screen, a smilar ad might follow. But if you frown , the next ad will be different. Hell a classroom computer could even detect when a student is becoming confused or bored. Well in that case it could vhelp modify lesson for the student to make them become more intertested in the assignment.

Well thank you readers i feel like i backed up my case with tih claim, we know computers or even technology in general might've changed in a jurrasic way but we will wonder what the future has in stored for us. We just gotta find out what's next in technology. My name is PROPER_NAME and this is my claim for FACS.      ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
AEA59D014F8B,"The use of technology that is able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom would be very valuable. There would be a number of benefits if there was such technology availiable. This technology would not only benefit the students in more ways than one.

If schools had technology that could read the faces of students and modify the lessons, it would increase the students chances of success. In the article, Dr. Huang claims, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" If the lesson was altered to improve the facial expression of the student, there is a huge chance that the student will become more engaged in the lesson, resulting in success. When a student is bored in a lesson, it is more than likely the student will not pay as much attention to it as well as they would if they were truly interested. Confusion may cause frustration which would lead to a more difficult learning process.

A student who is actually interested in a certain lesson has more of a chance to become excited about the lesson, making the learning experience more enjoyable and easier to learn. In the article, Dr. Huang says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This being said, most students will more than likely not verbaly express when they dislike a certain lesson. Most would show their unhappiness through facial expressions. Because a teacher may not be able to fully read a students facial expression, it would be more effective if computers were availiable to read the expressions and alter the lesson for the student.

Technology that is able to read the facial expressions of a student would benefit the student and the teachers. The student would be more engaged in the lesson, and the teacher would have a better understanding of what grabs the attention of his or her students compared to what drives his or her students away. The new technolgy would make a students more confident their skills, leading to a better, more successful educational system.    ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

We've managed to create and discover many great things, such as discovering fire, electricty, finding the cure for terrible diseases, and we must admit that all these things have changed our lives completely, whether it's in a bad, or in a good way.

We have now recently created a software, that allows computers to recognize our emotions, all by reading our facial expressions. They are now debating if they should include the software in school computers, this way the software would know whether the student is enjoying, struggling or getting confused by the lesson, which is exactly what they would need to know in order to modify the lesson. I personally believe that it would be a great idea to allow schools to have acces to this software, it would be a great help, since for many students, verbal communication is just not their thing. ""Most human communictaion is nonverbal, including emotional commmunication,"" notes Dr. Huang, sometimes it isn't easy to open up to people, especially teachers. Most students fear that teachers are going to yell at them or judge them instead of helping them out, and unfotunately this type of situations still happen in our school. Everyone deserves a chance to be heard or understood, even those who dont have the ability, or simply don't feel comfortable communicating verbally with others, this shouldn't even be up for debate.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2

63F4D4192E13,"A new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is described by the author of the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"". This system enables computers to identify six of the human emotions. This technology should be used to read the emotional expresiions of students in a classroom, because it is a very valuable technology.

Firstly, we should have this technology because it would help explain how people would be feeling on a certain subject, lifestyle or in everyday life. ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."" Since Dr. Eckman has programmed these emotions we can better understand how someone is feeling without having to ask him; each emotion inflicts a facial muscle movement which is recognised and is catagorized as an emotion.

In addiotion, we should have these identifiers because it could help students learn better. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This software could help someone who is easily distracted. This technology could find a way to help with this person, and the coding system could produce a lesson that this person can listen to and understand it because it was made for them.

Also, the Facial Action Coding System can help teachers and staff. Some students do not show what they are feeling. If this technology can figure out facial expressions then the teachers will know who is having a bad day, the teacher could then talk to this person privately and see how they are doing. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotuions, but also may even help produce them."" Since studies show that if a student smiles they could have a better day. The teacher could recognise that someone is feeeling down so they could say a funny joke and sprout an emotion into a particualr student.

In the final analysis, we should have the Facial Action Coding System in school because it will help students feel better and learn better. If a student does not want to go to school then they probably do not want to learn either. If this system can make someone's day then students would want to come to school, and teachers would then have students who want to learn. ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is a great article and the technology that is included in the article may be the next big thing. The first step for the coding system is to use the technology to read the emotional expression of student in classrooms. This technology can help a student throughout their school work. It can also help the teachers to teach more passionatly to students who want to learn and are not forced to come to school, but come voluntarily.",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8
204C675CDF5A,"Using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is just wrong. People are already feeling like they are being watched through their technology as is, and this would only validate that we don't have any privacy.

Technology just keeps growing and getting more advanced. We have robots that can cook, and cars that can drive themselves. While all of this can make our lives easier, you have to wonder where what these robots see goes. Today, there is a huge issue of privacy from the government. Almost all of our devices have cameras in them now, and we might not be the only ones who can see through them. With this facial expression recognition, it would only prove that we are being watched. I'm sure that some, if not all of the computers data gets observed by a human at some point, which means that you don't really know who is watching your every move.

Not only is this technology a threat to just your personal privacy, it could end up being a threat to your life. If someone has access to see through your computer, who knows what else they can access. So much of our lives are put on our computers with us trusting that noting will happen to that information. The article says that the technology can react to your face when you see certain ads on websites, which means that they are most likely able to see what is on the screen. Say you are logged into your bank account and switch over to another website that has an ad on it, while your bank tab is still open. Someone may be able to see that bank account information and rob you of your money. This example can be applied to many other things as well, like your credit card infomation if you buy anything online, or social sercurity number. At any time i'm sure this technology could also pinpoint your exact location, and if that gets put into the wrong hands by chance, yous ands your friends and families could potentially be in danger from an in-home robbery, or even possibly a murderer. Even in classrooms, the school's information could be hacked and threatened, so is it really even worth the risk?

I can see the positive side of this technology. The artuicle talks about how it can react and change ads based on your face, and even modify lesson plans for children in school, but unfortunatley the bad outweighs the good. There is too much of a risk of what can be seen, and who has access to that information, even if it is used in classrooms to help students.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

Facial Action Coding

This new technology that has ben created by the Prof. Thomas Huang, is realy impreseve and it can became realy help full in our lives. But can help more in the classromms because it would help the teachers to now how their students are fealling and if they are having problems in the class or in theyr personal lives.

The Facial Action Coding System worcks by associating characteristic movements of the facial muscles witch emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This technology can help the teachers ""reconize when a student is becoming confuse or bored""(Dr. Huang). So the teacher can find a way to help their students, by founding another way to make them comprehend the class better or talk about their problems and find a solution.

In conclusion having this tipe of technololy in our schools can be realy help full and make a big change on the way students see the chools and in how the students learn. Beacuse by using this technology the teachers can find ways to make theyr clases more interesting or find diferent options so the students cant learn more, and they also can help to identify students that have problems or that have tipes of sadness or anger so the teachers can help them find a solution to theyr problems.

0C8E8861F91A,"I agree with the claim against the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions. First off, we perform these calcutions everyday, as we can tell if our friend is happy or sad by looking at their face most of the time. Also, video imagery tells us that the facial emotions for each emotion are universal. Another big reason is that we really don't know just how much computers can do, it can be where computers detect whether you're happy or sad.

Performing this calculation every day, we would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. However, we can also use human anatomy to help paint precisely enough to convey specific emotions. New computer software has anatomical information as electronic code. Video imagery which is the new emotion-recognition software which tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. The software can detect mixed emotions by weighing the different units. We really don't know how much the computer can do, it can detect if you're happy or sad, and make computer-animated faces.

In a whole, this is a lot to disagree with, since computers are taking over our world now so I believe this is a great idea. Reason being is that we have video imagery, the amazing and undiscovered knowledge of a computer, and our own brains because we calculate expressions on our own every day.

DDEEC49D2390,"Kids across America probably know someone who looks or acts like they are depressed, but when they ask what is wrong they usually say they are fine or nothing is wrong and they will try to continue their day. Having a Facial Action Coding System inside of schools would benefit many schools and people. If schools had this and staff heard about a kid who is not looking mentally well they can have the kid go through the system and if anything is wrong they could give the kid the help he or she needs.

The child will not be able to slide past the system with a fake smile either because in paragraph 7 the FACS can detect the difference between a forced smile and a genuine smile making it harder for you to slip passed the system. The FACS does not always have to be used to see if a child feels bad and needs help. In paragraph 6 Dr. Haung says that if a child was on a computer the computer could recognize if the student was confused or bored. This could benefit kids greatly because sometimes kids are afraid to ask questions in front of the class, but if this was set up to where the teachers were alerted when a kid was confused the teacher could just walk over to the child and ask what they were confused about and asses the problem right where the kid is sitting.

A339C727FB27,"I think that using the Facial Action Coding System in schools is a great idea.

Teachers always want to know if you understand the lessons and objectives they are teaching you.

If you're anything like me then you will just act like you know what's going on because you don't want to ask any questions.

The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classes would be valuable because it would help show the teachers if the students understand what they are being taught, it would help the students understand eachothers emotions, and since most schools have technology the system could show how they are feeling on their devices as well.

If teachers had the Facial Action Coding System device on hand they could easily see how the students are feeling about a particular lesson.

This would work well for the students that don't share their opinions in the classroom or at all.

If students did not understand a lesson the emotion reading device could show the teacher how the students are feeling.

If the device shows students are confused or bored, the teacher could modify the lesson to better the students and increase their knowledge capacity and possibly make it more entertaining.

The technology could also help the teenagers express how they truly feel because some teenagers are hard to read.

Some teens, like myself, have a resting face that makes me look angry at the world and unapproachable.

I think a device like this would show that some peers are not as angry or upset as their resting face shows.

Also, most communication takes place over technology nowadays.

Personally, my school has laptops and I think it would be great if the software was on our devices because emotions play a huge role in everyone's lives.

This software would also help numerous school guidance counselors across the globe because they deal with all sorts of emotions everyday.

I know some of my peers do not enjoy sharing emotions or their opinions on certain situations with people they are not familiar with, and I am the exact same way, but if you are in harms way and still will not express what is going on then this device would be exremely helpful.

The technology has the intelligence to identify mixed emtions which is helpful because most people have trouble percieving facial traits and expressions.

If my school had this software, I would be all over it trying to find out how I feel because sometimes I don't even know my own emotions.

037C6126FDE4,"Technology that can read your emotional expressions is very valuable to students in a classroom, because it can provide information on how you are feeling. It provides emotions that a humans eye cannot detect. A lot of people dont realize how others are feeling because they hide their emotions. Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) created a facial system to detect the emotions of a person's face. This system is very valuable because it gives better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

This software constructs a 3-D computer model of the face with all 44 major muscles in the model. Eckman classified six basic emotions-happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness and he asscociated each with characteristic movements of facial muscles. A big amount of students dont focus because of the distraction around them. A teachers job is to keep them focused at all times, but sometimes it is hard for an individual person to keep track of so many students. This techonolgy can help students in many different ways. By weighting the different units, the software can identify mixed emotions, which can help the student by making the work they are doing simple or more difficult. For example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. It modifies the lesson, like an effective human instructor.

The FACS is a very valuable techonolgy for students because it helps to guide them through a problem they might be facing. It can help a classroom full of students that are confused on a lesson.

In the school teachers know if you are confused or mad they see you expresion on your face. Teachers are in the classroom to help you understand and learn what is being teached to you.

One of the many reasons why the facial acting coding systeam technology is not a valueable in a classroom is because it does not help when you are given an assignment on paper and a book and if you are confused you ask a teacher to help you a technology will not help you solve the confusen it will just tell you are confused. Another reson is it is very unuseful to what you do during school hours because you work durning school hours that does not help the work ethic you put into your education. Lastly it does not help you graduate if you use a facial action coding systeam it justa systeam that you can have fun with and know how you are feeling.

The Facial Action Coding System is a usless system that does not help you growth in learning in school. You do not need it to graduate to the next grade. Also it does not help you to use it if you have a question on an assignment , homework or test that is what a teacher is for to help you solve your questions.

First of all, the article explains that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. It's crazy how a computer can configure that. If this is brought into classrooms, this could be a gamebreaker. This is a plus for kids that may not have access to computers at home, to give them technology at school. In paragraph 4, Dr. Huang says people show different degrees of expressions. He says a computer uses video imagery can track facial movement.

Next, this new process may bring in new technology and promote computer use. In paragraph 2 and 3, the article states that you can calculate an expression similar to math homework. This wil not only promote the use of technology, but it may get kids to do their homework. If this interests children enough to get them to do their homework, it could promote new classes for them to take.

Moving on to the next topic, creating new topics. If kids really like to examine peoples expressions, not only will it be amazing but it could create a whole new field of learning. Similar to a crime investigator, they could literally investigate someone's face to see what their expression is. In paragraph 5, the article digs deeper into the investigation. It explains that you can tell if a friend is happy or sad, by looking at their facial expression. If this was taken to a new level, we could have profesionals on our hands, just by making a class for it.

To conclude the topic, reading a facial expression by using a computer, or just by looking deeper into somones face, could take you far.

39AF0292F9B3,"Schools are places where kids end up spending the majority of their childhood in. Most kids end up disliking school for one reason or another, while others might love school. To have the ability to know how a child is feeling and map their patters can become useful in more ways than one. The use of reading a students emotions is valuable in many ways like helping with possible depression, enhancing the material, and creating a better enviroment.

School can be a stressful time for many students and also a time of growth. Especially in high school and even middle school, the childs body is going through puberty. This chemical change in the body can lead to mood swings and other issues especially when school stress is added on top. This technology is capable of indicating ""...the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(paragraph 7). With the aid of this technology the school can help students before they develope mental illnesses like depression that often go unseen due to hiding true emotion.

Also, in many schools students usually find the learning material to be sub par or boring in many cases. However with the aid of this technology ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (paragraph 6). If a teacher was able to pin point when exactly a lesson becomes boring it would majorly help with being able to reconstruct it as well. For difficult classes being able to know when the students are lost would help significantly in increasing the understanding of the material as teachers will be able to know exactly what the students dont understand, and thus be able to help them achieve better grades.

Being able to understand students emotions in a learning enviroment can also help with improving the school overall. SInce the technology would be able to understand the basic emotions like ""...happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" (paragraph 3), this can give a school tons of feedback on how to improve. For example, with negative emotions, a school would be able to improve its cafeteria food quality from knowing what foods are highly unpopular, and as a result save food from wasting. Or during school events, even though the event might be a success knowing how each of the students felt about the event would help with improving it for next year. The addition of this technology would allow a school to be the best the possibly could.

The addition of this facial technology can be quite revolutionary in a school setting. As students often dont share their true feelings, issues can be confronted and the students mentality can be improved. Also a better, and positive learning enviroment can be created. The ability to remove student confusion and make learning interesting would go a long way in helping not only the students grow and move forward positivly, but also the school as a whole.",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8

508DB90F68C7,"I think using this technology in a classroom would be a huge breakthrough. Teachers wouldn't have to work as hard to figure out what he or she needs to do to help a student learn what they need to learn. This technology can tell what their emotional state is when in the classroom. If they are bored they might not like the way their teacher is teaching them. So the teacher can modify the way she teaches that specific lesson, so that the student has a better attitude toward that subject.

This technology can also help councelers talk to the students that might be having personal problems like bullies, or family issues at home. Kids wouldn't be able to hide their emotions as well with this techlology being in every classrom. For example with a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major, and another muscle called the risorius. You cant download the software on a normal computer, so schools would have to pay for the device its-self. It would be extremely expensive but it would help many students in classrooms, or some that need counceling.

Humans perform this type of calculation every day, for instance when you ask a friend if they are ok, because they look depressed or angry. We can perform this calculation as accurately as the current technology we have now. For example Leonardo da Vinci used this type of calculation and knew exactly how her face needed to look in order to get the emotions he was looking for.

In conclusion this technology has many benefits for students and children that need counceling for personal problems, and or family problems at home.                                 ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
7D0DC6F08EB2,"The Facial Action Coding System is a new software that enables computers to identify human emotions. This software detects how other people are feeling even if they are trying to hide their emotions. Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute of Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, is the creator of this expectacular software. The use the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is helpful.

This computer software works with emotion algorithms. According to the passage, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" Mona Lisa, Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, was tested with this software. A recent study shows that Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, 2 percent angry. The Facial Action Coding System uses video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements. The text also states that this software can even identify mixed emotions.

The Facial Action Coding System is helpful at schools. With the help of this software, teachers could know when a student is sad or angry. This computer software can also detect mixed emotions. This new software could even save lifes. For example, nowadays with the bullying's situation, a teacher would detect when a student is being bullyied or if the student is under a depression. The teacher could help him and prevent any type of accident. The software can help at schoosl in other ways. The text states, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Hung predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'""

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System has been developed that improves accuracy in perciving the emotions of others. Making faces reveal so much about the science of emotions. Becuase of this software, teachers could see when a student is sad or angry and the teacher could help him. The software could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.

This example ""these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful"" how can you tell if someone is being truthful through emotions? We all express our emotions differently, so differently that computers can't tell the difference. I think that the technology is useless and they should use their time to cure sicknesses or to help people besides telling their emotions through a computer. Instead of using their knowledge to make a computer telling the difference between emotion's they should put it into a good use like a cure to all sickness.

Anyone can put a smile on their face just to get through the day and be feeling so much or simply going through alot but only someone whom is close to that person can probably detect their emotions and by their facial expressions on how theyre feeling. So when in the passage it stated faces dont lie these muscle clues are sometimes used when spotted when a smiling politician or celebrity isnt being truthful I disagreed. How would they know that if they just met them and are simply having a conversation maybe even if the celebrity or politician is or isnt being honest the subject may have made them feel uncomfortable or upset them but to say theyre not being truthful isnt the case because you dont know them enough to say how their feeling, or if their being dishonest based on the other peoples faces you've"" studied"".

Due to new technology such as, the Facial Action Coding System, professionals can tell exactly how someone is feeling in a picture, or even in class during a lesson. This new application will have a massive impact on how teachers educate kids. This will help out teachers with how to teach a lesson and improve how engaged kids will be in class.

First, classroom computers could use this program to recongnize when a student is confused or bored. The computer would then modify the lesson so the student will hopefully become interested again. This program could really get kids to learn and become interested about what is being taught. This would ultimately lead to higher passing rates and better futures for kids.

Secondly, this technology can make video games or video surgery alot more expressive. Some faces in videos are really bland and boring. If the faces were better detailed and more expressive the viewer will be interested and will pay more attention. Expressions on animated faces are really important, these features draw the viewers attention and will interest them.

All in all, this new technology is very valuable in a classroom. It would durrastically change how kids learn and would make them way more interested than they currently are. Most kids do not learn the same, this technology could change that so each student can learn the way that best helps them.

This technology can be helpful for students because of new emotion-recognized software tracks these facial movements. By weighting the different units, the software can identified by the using mixed emotions. Each emotion is compared against neutral face, in other words no expression shown. You can tell the difference of a person's face of how they're feeling just by looking at their face. But they might alsp, have other feelings within inside them.

Not only student but also adulsts might not like it either when they go to work and there boss trys to scan them and see what emotion thier in. I don't think anybody will like that idea of have that kinda technology. I'll say it will not be a good idea because what if the scanner is wrong not saying it is but what about after multiple tests on the scanner and its scans a person and the scanner says thier in that mood and if the person might not be in that moods the machine will probably be giving the wrong information.

I can say that I don't believe that techology can always be right and always be right because theres been problems with other stuff that they have invented like cars,phones,computers,laptops,and droms. Some stuff can maunfunction not everything that has been invented turn out great. That why I said a scanner that can read emotional experssion is kinda of a bad.

My seconed reason is becuase reason a article can halp people feel better if they pay good attions to what the story says. my last reason is becuase showing feelings they the way we look.

My first reason it can help students becuase by the way people read the story and look at the foto there is a lot of ways to look and read it. If there is a person who really is feeling sad they can read a story that has a lil og exititing moments on the story and with happy pictues that shows the feelings of the story. It can help alot beuase by looking at the pictuce and really paying attintion to the story it can grab the readers attintion. Once th author got the readers attiontion the reader is going to be focesed of what the book is about and going to make them change their feelings.

My seconed reason by reading the article it can change feelings. It can make then get into the feeling they want to get into eather it can be mad, sad, happy scared, exited, ect. There is a lot of feeling people can get into if they into what the author want to tell them by reading.

My last reason is by the way they look. Not alot of the people show they way they feel. If people dont show how they feel it becuase most of the idea is becuase hey are holding there feelings down deep in them. If they not showing it most people say they dont show it because they dont want to make people worry becuase they are in a bad mood and just dont want to get bothered. They try to show they are stong but deep dow they are holding a hard feelings they they going to remember at some other time becuase they are heoding it in them and they are the people who just dont want to do stuff at a surten time.

0A1D964232EF,"I agree with the idea that the Facial Action Coding System should be used on students and infact anyone in general if wanted to read emotion expression. It can help out alot by if a teen or someone has something bottled up deep inside of them.

Its not good to keep emotions bottled up for a long time it will eventually get to you. But with the help of this machine if you use it on someone and there not okay you can genuinely help them or you can get some help for them yourself. For an example if something is happening at home and they become all sad and depressed and wont tell anyone why theyre feeling what they are feeling. And no one has a clue you can use the machine to help figure it out and get them the help that they properly need wether if its they need someone to talk to about troubles or if they actually need to go see a doctor to check and see if they have something wrong with them.

One downside to this machine is that. What if they get the emotions wrong? Out of all the emotions the machine is bound to get one wrong because so many people feel like so many differnt things and there is a chance to get the feelings wrong.

On the other hand we dont know how many types of emotions there are listed within the machine there could be almost all emotions plugged into it.

At the very beginning of the article, it talks about the emtions of Mona Lisa for she is eighty-nine percetnhappy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful and two percent angry. Honestly, if I was forced to sit for hours and stare at nothing while some old guy painted my picture, I would not be very happy about it. The technology works by constructing a 3-D computer model of the face that it has been presented with all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding SYstem) has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness.

In paragraph six, Dr. Huange predicts that a classroom computer could recognize whena student is becoming confused or bored then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. As a student n high school, I honestly do not believe that Facial Action Coding System is necessary for a classroom. Our biology teacher makes the notes for us herself so the computer would have no way of changing anything to make it interesting. Along with the fact that most human communication us nonverbal, inclusing emotional communicaton, the computer need to understand that also. I believe that this Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a waste of time when there are more important matters at hand in this world. WIth the recent school shootings, I believe that we should be spending more time trying to make different types of affective things to protect students when a shooter enters a school. I saw an article about how a school has recently installed bullet proof ""rooms"" into every classroom. Whenever someone comes over the intercom, telling the school that they are under attack, the students rush into the room that can hold up to thriy to forty kids. This is what we should spend more time with. Making sure our students are safe, not trying to figure out whether the emtions of students while in class or the emotions of a painting from a few hundred years ago.

Now, I am not saying that FACS would not be helpful in some cases. It could be used with therapists who have patients that do not want to cooperate with them or a patient in a metnal hospital. The effectiveness in a classroom is very low in many cases. The facts that they can recognize the human emotion based on the muscles of the face like the zygomatice major (muscles that begin at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. Yes it does seem interesting but like I said before, it should not be used in a classroom.

This would be because we wouldnt be able to tell if ther person is scared or worried or just in need of help from anyone.

First of all, my biggest problem with this is that we cant rely on computers to tell us everything they cant feel what we feel when we look in the eyes of someone else. Not to metion that a computer can only do as much as we program it to do so it can only know all that we have discovered so it cant tell the different emotions of any accuratly because it doesnt know their give aways or how well they hide their emtions.

Secondly, you cant just base someone's emotions off of their facial expressions. This is because everyone including me find ways to hide how they are feeling and find ways to make their face look unemtional. To this effect people can control their facial muscles to a different degree of effiecenty. So, there for the computer would possible give inaccurate reports over and over again.

So, in the end I dissagree with that fact that this computer can tell how people are feeling based on their facial expressions. This is because for one they can't know for sure how well the person can control the muscles in their face, secondly they cant see the look in the eyes of the person and feel the emotion that is coming off the person who is looking at the computer.

If we have FACS in the classrooms then the kids are going to be told what they feel and not learn what they are feeling on there own. If a student is sad but doesn't want everyone to know becase they dont want to talk about it then Facs would not give that student the space they need.

FACS is reading your emotions before you know what your emotions are. Its telling you that you will be sad before you know that you will be sad. Or if someone says something mean to you and you dont know how to feel about it FACS tells you to feel happy or sad or mad.

If you want privace then FACS takes it away by reading your face. it reads it and knows your mood. it can tell when you are mad at someone or sad about something. You cant get away from your emotions so FACS will always reed them.

44BD004D9B29,"The Facial Action Coding System a new technology that helps you to understand human emotions, it can calculate the movement of the major muscles of your face, it can recognize six basic emotions, and it can make a difference beetwen a real and a fake emotion

First, The Facial Action Coding System can calculate the movement of the muscles of your face, the software has a process that begins by making a model of your face in third dimension including 44 the major muscles of your face, after associate the movement of your muscles with a face that has no emotion then it know what was the movement of every muscle from its normal position to the position that has when there is a emotion.

Second, it can recognize six basic emotions, the six basics emotion that the software can recognize is: happines, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. how it works? well it recognizes every muscle and analyzes the movement that every muscle makes when you have an emotion, that means that there are predeterminated movements and the software associate the movements of your face and the prederminated movements for every emotion.

Finally, it can make a difference between a real and a fake emotion, it means that the software is capable to recognize natural movements of your face and forced movements, it is a helpful characteristic because the software cannot have a mistake when it is analyzing emotions.

In Summary, the software has enough capacitiy to recognize, the movements of your face, Recognize six emotions, difference between a real and a fake expresion, it means that it just need to add more emotions and improve the analyzing of faces and the software would be helpful.

In the article it states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. this shows how the syetem can be used for good in a classroom and help kids who may have learning disabillites have an easier time understanding the lesson and learning more.

Another reason that this system can be useful in the classroom is it could make a computer animated faces have more expression so say the lesson the student is learning is online using an animated instructor the system would code the instructors face to have more expression when explaining the lesson leading the the student to learn more aprehensivly. In the Article is says that ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressivefor video games or video surgery. Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Huang. So computers need to understand that, too."" this shows how it can makes animated faces have more expressions such in Video games, Video surgeries, and classroom lesson.

11A5C9E39DB3,"Yes, the use of this technology is very valuable in many ways. The technology can detect how you are feeling, in the passage it tells you that the computer can tell if a human is mad, happy, sad, worried, etc.

This technology can be very useful to techers as well as anyone else. If a student is feeling a lot of emotion and trying to do school work, they will be more focused on what they were feeling instead of the work the teacher has given him/her. It can also help the teacher to know how exactly to act twards a student. For example, if a student is feeling 75% sad they are most likely going to cry. If a student is about to cry and teacher starts yeling at them for not paying attention, because the student isn't feeling like themselves that day its going to trigger the students brain to make them cry.

In conclusion, this tehcnology in my opinion should most defiently be used in schools. Not only to help the teachers out, but for the stundents themelves. I think that if we use this technology it will increase focuse on school work will improve moods, and increase better grades and testing scores.

CD32C611650D,"I think that using the Facial Action Coding System is a very good and valuable resource to use. I think that it could benefit society and schools very well because then they could tell if a student likes school or does not, tell if the undertsand a lesson or not, and just know how they are feeling throughtout each class so that the school or place can try to fix it. They can even make adjustments according to the students emotions on the internet.

I think that if we had this new technology in our schools it could benefit us a lot. In school you can finally tell if someone truly likes it or just puts on a fake smile to fool everyone else. The new (FACS) system can help to determine how a child or adult feels during every hour of everyday. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" You can tell if your classmates are sad or happy or however they feel around you and just in the school place in general. If someone in school is sad or mad we can finally understand and try to get them the help that they need before the situation worsens.

The new (FACS) system would also benefit the school system by telling if a child is confused or not. In class everyone has gotten bored and just stops thinking sometimes. ""A clssroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. The classroom would change forever because then people will not be embaressed to say that they are confused because the computer will adjust the lesson for you if you look confused. This is a great way to make sure students get the help they need so they can move on and succeed.

Finally, we can predict how a person feels even if they just are looking into a computer. ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different. Our own computers can pick out ads for us to enjoy based on our intrests and facial expressioin. Nobody likes ads but this can make ads more tolerable then to get and ad about something that you have no intrest in. Computers will understand non verbale communication because these days people text and talk on the phone there is really not much talking in person so the computer will know that you are happy or sad when on a certain page or watching a certain ad.

In conclusion i think that this is a great idea and is valuable to have these in schools. There are so many pros about having these in schools and they can and will benefit a lot of people and their lives. In class we no longer have to be shy we can get our lesson adjusted according to our own understanding not everyone else's understandings.         ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
F446AA6BC388,"I believe that the use of this technology would be valuable, as long as students sign off or allow their emotions to be detected by this software. It could be valuable to find learning plans and lessons for all students, so their learning is more interactive for them and more interesting. It could also help detect things such as depression and try report that to a parent or counselor to try and improve their situation. Eventually the software could become so advanced that it could detect suicidal thoughts, in which case, could save lives. But alas, students would have to be okay with this technology being used on them, otherwise it's an invasion of privacy.

A professor by the name of Dr. Huang at Beckman Institute at the University of Illinois is working in collaboration with Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang taught a computer what facial muscles equal what emotion. If this software was implemented into school computers, I wouldn't see a problem with that. By implementing this software students could have a more interactive learning environment or a more interesting learning experience overall. But there are still flaws in this software, a student would be able to manipulate the software into only teaching them about a certain subject that they partcularly like. So the software needs more advanced fake emotion detection, and needs to teach things that ""seem"" boring because its still vital information humans need to live. If someone were to dislike math, but really like science and they were never taught math at all, the person would be unable to succeed in life due to this software failing.

If this software is implemented, it should not be used often. Although it can help the learning environment it can also hurt it. While I support the software being used in a learning environment, I do not condone this being put onto personal computers for financial gain or marketing purposes.

That is a good idea because this could impact investigation, like cops figuring out who the're dealing with. For example, say there was a bank robbery and the criminals got away, but soon the cops found them and arrested them, they could either sit down with them and try and work their way around to see if the're is something wrong with them or they could just snap a picture and figure out thier expressions by using the FACS, (Facial Action Coding System). that would make it easier on investigators because the artical says ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly"". using video imagery, the new software tracks the facial movements in a real face. This technolgy can improve how well things are animated too, like on tv, and video games. overall i think this is a gonna impact so many cool things that is still to come.

This new technology is valuable in many cases and in classrooms in not the ecception because it can help students have a diffferent learning enviroment.

This is 2018 and we need changes, good changes. The way that we learn is changing really fast and now there are better methods to help students understand and learn, for example: apps, websites, homeschool ,ect. By the use of this new technology students can have the chance to have a better education by having the help of a program that can see your facial expression and determine if you might need another teaching method that can help you improve your learning skills. For example in paragraph 6 says: '' A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confuced or bored'' Dr. Huang Predicts .''Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'' this shows how effective this new technology can be to students that want to have a better education. With this program or technology students do not have to worry if the teacher do not know how to explain a specific subject in a different way that the student can understand. This new technolog is valuable because is prepared to have multiple ways to teach a subject so the student can understand it in a way that could help them memmorize the subject.

With this new technology being able to recognize students emotions can be useful. It should be used the same when students get their vision and hearing checked. Every student in the school should be checked by the technology to read their emotional expressions. Someone might be going though deep depression on the inside but seem to be fine on the outside to where they dont show their depression. My oldest sister was depressed but didnt show it, we could have lost her to suicide. I wouldnt want anyone else to go through what my family did if they can just get help by the new technology.

This new technology is to tell the six basic emotions and which emotions the person is feeling more. Sadness and being angry are the two emotions that should be focused on more. Somone who cant express their emotions can take this test and end up getting help from others who can help this person in makinging them feel loved and cared for. It could also help in school when students are confused or bored with the lesson. This technology can read the students emotions and help the teachers help their student comprehend what is being taught.

With the help of a computer identifying wether a persons emotion shows sadness, confusion and etc., the help of this technology can educate students in different ways. For example, if the computer recognizes a student is confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. This invention could completely change the way teachers teach and help them understand how a student feels about a topic. Just by looking into this advanced computer, it can improve your skills and help you better understand the topic.

Using this new invention can impact the way students are learning and determine if they are a slower learner than others. The technology can easily modify the lesson if it recognizes a confused emotion on your face. Students may tend to find themselves further educated with the use of facial recognition just by showing a single emotion and the way your facial features are moved.

In conclusion, I believe the use of this technology in schools can change the way teachers are educating their students. It can also notify teachers if a student is struggling on a certain topic if the teachers can view that the lesson had to be modified on a students laptop.

Some students might want to talk about it, but most probably wouldn't so it might make them even more upset or angry and sad if you ask whats wrong and they dont want to talk about it. Also if it a personal issue the student is having and they tell you what's wrong and you can't help them they might feel like they're doing something wrong and get sad or depressed becasue you can't help them. Also if this was used to read the emotinal expressions of students in the classroom I feel like it would be a distraction and take time out of the students learing to figure out how every student is feeling based on the facial expressions. Another thing could be what of the technology making this possible is wrong, so you walk up to a student and ask them why they're so happy but they are actually really sad. What if the student just changes their apperance to make them look a different way when they are read for their emotion.

Even though have a computer or some machine telling me that i feel a certain way sounds cool, it's not going to benefit students in a school enviroment. I say this because , students already stress enough. Why tell them that they're stress? That will make thing worse. Say for instince, a student is having a bad day andhe comes to class mad your tell they're mad is just goin to make them MORE mad. In the artice it saids, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions..."" there are way more than six emotions that exist. So what happens when your non of those emotions, say your depressed and computer says your angry, then the computer is wrong.

One other thing everyone says, phones and elcetronics are a destraction to teens, why bring a machine in to the agurement and tell the students they aren't in a good mood. So everytime they a feeling a certain way they are worried about someone else telling them how they feel because a machine said they feel some type of way. Therefore making the worry about someone elses in their business and trying to mask the emotions completely so a computer system won't detect any emotion, instead of doing the work assigned in class.

The ability to detect human emotions is not valuable because some humans are embarassed when others know what they are feeling, and they would learn to keep their face neutral while feeling because they don't want to constantly be read like a book by some robot.

This technology could be valuable because you could tell when kids in school are getting mad or even have depression or anxiety. Facs could help us to help the future generations of students to talk about their emotions because they won't have to state how they feel, but a robot would be doing that for them.

FACS is not the best idea because some kids like to keep to themselves and just the thought of eveyone knowing how you feel constantly would give them anxiety and make them fearful to feel because of what others may think and so on and so forth.

I dont think that using this technology is a valuable idea because then the government could end up taking the technology into the real world and using it against the people. I am not okay with being read but a robot, personally.

This technology could also help to keep schools safe, by letting the administration know when someone if looking guilty or even if they are starting to get angry because of something, it could help to stop some school shootings because the students would have a certain emotion to them and then we would know to pull that student aside, or it could help students who have anxiety to tell when they need to step out of class and go for a walk or use their coping skills.

I don't have a straight forward opinion on the new technology because it has alot of pros and cons.

The reason being for my opinion is that if a computer in a classroom can tell if im sad it'll probably change my mood by the time I leave that class. Like the passage said if the computers in the classroom can tell if your sad it'll give u a different ad from the one youll get if your happy or smiling. Also , lets say a student is sitting at the computer bored maybe the ad that pops up may change that for them. Many students now a days dont do their work or what their supposed to do because of boredom. I think having computers understand a persons emotions, mood, facial expressions and etc. is pretty cool. You dont know what goes on out of school, to cause that persons emotions. If a person and computer can comunicate I feel like itll help out in so many ways.

EBFCCFB520CF,"Using technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because I don´t think we need social media to tell us how we feel in a classroom setting because as students we know what are facial expressions are like. For example, happiness is one of the expressions that people use everyday without this technology telling us if we are happy or not which I would argue is against this think it is unreliable. According to the text it states that ´´moving our facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. Another reason why I think using this technology to read emotional expression to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because I just don´t see it as helpful really and everybody has different emotions happy, sad, mad, or proud. So that is why I don´t think this technology can help figure out emotions in a classroom.

The technology that we use to determine emotions in a classroom can be through social media and how I think that it is not helpful at all. For example, a lie detector is a tool to tell whether you are lying or telling the truth which I can see is helpful but really not that helpful at all that´s what we got courts to go to and if somebody did something in the classroom to attract facial expression we can tell by the look on their face and how they reacted to the situation which is why we got counselors to talk to when we are faced with personal issues or just having one of those days. Another reason why the the technology like FACS according to the text wouldn´t be helpful for students in a classroom setting is because all though technology can determine facial expressions when used in the reak world I don´t think it can determine emotional feelings students have in a classroom. According to the text it states that ´´a classroom computer could recognize´´ when a student is becoming confused or bored´´, Dr. Huang predicts´´. While that may sound good I just think it´s bias and would never be used because we can determine as humans if students are confused or bored by how the class is or questions on an assignment.

In the classroom technology I don´t think could handle what we feel as students emotionally on the inside and outside in a classroom whether it be the whole day of school or the last day of school. This brings me back to my point about the students being confused or bored in a classroom really because if a classmate is bored their expression would be mad because a teacher would talk a lot or a student might take a lot of time with a presentation by talking for a lot of minutes, or another way might be yawning or sighing. Technology wouldn´t help the cause of emotional emotions when a studet loss a loved one and a student would have to miss a day because they had to go to a funeral for the person that died, and anytime students here that they grieve and start crying. That is another reason why technology would not be valuable to read certain emotions.

Using this technology like FACS could not read certain emotions because number 1 it wouldn´t be able to tell what students are feeling in the classroom. Number two I don´t think it would be as resourceful when describing emotional feelings inside and outside of a particular student in a classroom environment. And the last one would be that it wouldn´t be able to tell if a person is confused or bored. I just don´t see the value of technology proving anything to us about how students feel in a classroom. That´s why technology wouldn´t be valued as a reliable tool.

In conclusion, I am against the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions in a classroom because it wouldn´t be helpful. It wouldn´t be valued as the greatest thing to help determine students facial expressions like happy, sad, bored, confused, or mad. It would be a waste of time just using the technology for that particular situation with students in a classroom. This technology would fail and not meet the requirements or standards of facial expression. I would advise people to go against the people that are for technology being valued as a way to read facial expressions.       ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

I think that using this technology in a classroom would be valuable. i think it would because, when a student is acting up in a different way but doesnt really like to show his emotions the computer can detect it and the teacher can help him out through what he is suffering through.

Second, i think it would be a great thing because the facial action coding system could allow us to interact with one another and globalize each other around. i think this becuase their are times when students are mad and fired up and just do not want to be bothered so using this can help out a lot. This new technology can benefit the teachers too because they can know what his or hr students are feeling whether they're bored, about to fall asleep becuase then they can figure out another way to figure out a way to teach the class in a better sucessful way.

Third, the system can a smile to your face when you realize what the computer is capable of and not only will it detect that also the little facial expressions you make time to time such as confusement, boredum and ETc.

In conclusion i do think that the facial acting coding program is a good one and should be allowed in classrooms because it could help each other out and the teachers by makking the class a little better just by a different way of teaching. not only the education but also with being friends and your family because now you can check up on them.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

Here's the big question, do you really think this technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom?

The Facial Action Coding System is a system for the computer to read your facial expressions. In paragraph 3, the author states,"" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 muscles must move human like."" A movement of one or more muscle is called an ""action unit"".

According to the article titled ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D' Alto, The Process begins whe the computer constructs a 3-D computer of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. This software is an innovation from Prof, Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Sciense at the University of Illiniois.

This computer software then could change the lesson, like an effective human instructor. One example is thet, Your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) rases your eyebrows when you are surprised.

Well, this new software that has been made to perceive the emotions of others, could be very helpful in schools as they would be able read students' emotional expressions. This will lead teachers and even parents to know how the person is feeling about school or in other aspexcts.

9B4D623F1D2A,"The claim as an imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even trying tot hide their emotions. Perhaps the new software developed improvements in perceiving emotions of others.

It explains within facial expression for each emotion. By using the software as they use to do tracks and making it 3D realistic, it can identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared against a neutal face which meaning no show of emotion. As an example, imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen then a smiliar ad might follow but if you frown the next ad will be different. I know that its not true that if you make a confusion face in front of the computer screen it wont appear a confusion. Let's say you make of your own, using the computer to make a 3D of a person face which it could be anybody, you control and how you feel into it, it'll appear what you put in and it will show how you felt about it by loking of your final results on making the portrait.

For humans which they perform the same impressive ""calculation"" of how much emotions come into what you feel. As an example: you have a friend and you look upon their face, you wonder and can tell if their sad or happy. It's way different as they say on software than in person as a human. You can automatically describe how the person feel is by looking and talking to them. It shows a lot and you can define if they are good or not.

By knowing the differences on defining facial expression each on software and as a human, they are two completely different things and how it can be solve too. As being explained how they calculated by using technology and making 3D Mona Lisa, showing emotion to it collecting your actions. By how you make it as weighting the different units. In human which person per person, you can define their feelings and talk about it. There's no way you can hide away your feelings because sometimes you can sense it.

5D3A3ABBF956,"My personal opinion is that a machine like this would be useless in a classroom. Why spend lots of money on a machine, when all it does is read emotions of students. Students dont need a machine to tell them what they are feeling. If a school is going to spend alot of money on a machine that does only 1 thing, then they should be donating money, having really good school lunchs, and very nice field trips. Having a machine that tells emotions, is like having a machine that tells people when to eat.

Humans are cabable of knowing what they are feeling, when they are hungry, when to use the restroom, when to go to bed. The only humans that should have someone telling them when to eat are infants because they dont know what to or think or when to eat. Thats why they wear diappers, they dont know how to use the restroom or when to. But as they get older they learn when to go to the bathroom and where to go. Same with emotions, they learn what the emotion is, and why they feel the way they do.

Schools should save their money, not buy machines that are useless, and use the money for good. Help the poor, get better lunchs, invest in sports programs, maybe create a new program. If a school has money to spend on machines, then they should add on to the school, make it bigger, hire more teachers. If a student is having trouble in a math class, hire a tutor to help them.

EE377D38C330,"A lot of people don't know that this techonolgy nowadays could determine the way you feel, it could determine the emotions that peope feel. It also shows the emotions or feelings of others. People probably think that this some type of joke or laugher kind of way when its not there really is techonology nowadays that could detect it. There's probably many ways people can detect to read the emotional expressions of students. Some ways that you probably didn't even know of.

A lot of people wonder how this works they don't really know that one easy way to show emotion or to show how you feel is by looking at them and looking at their actions. Once you have already seen them and that they are feeling some kind of way that's when you realize that there is something going on or that their sad or happy or that they are just going through stuff. People know that by the facial expressions on their face. They say that us as humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"". Some people struggle or have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried,sad,etc. This would be one easy way students can detect emotions.

Parents probably disagree about using technology when showing their emotions. Not just parents but maybe some students wouldn't like it either but if they think about it instead of waisting your time just guessing what their emotions are you would know if they use the proper techonology. They had made a process that began when the computer constructed a 3-D computer model of the face and it showed that all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.

Another interesting thing that they discovered was that Dr. Paul Eckman was the creator of FACS (Facial Action Coding System). He had classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. It also associated each with characterestic movements of the facial muscles. They invented somethIng else called video imagery, the new emotion software is that they track facial movement. As you can see its so easy to see their emotions or how they feel. They even show different weighting of units.

The author says that the Mona Lisa demonstrates is really to bring a smile to peoples face while it shows how much the computer can do. It would be really strange if a computer can tell you if your happy or sad.

7A86A98F3909,"Facial Action Coding System is a potential and valuable way to read students' emotions while in class. Through the use of this technology, it could bring forth various opportunites. The system could open doors to the genuine thoughts of students to let adults better understand a view into their minds . Utilizing this technology will illustrate a positive change to the school by giving instructors insight to a students mental health, engagment with certain topics, and learning style.

The mental health of a student is a vital piece of information that a teacher should know. In the text, the author states that, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...So computers need to understand that too"" (Alto 6). By writing this, he conveys to readers that the software can process your emotions. Therefore, if a student demonstrates a pattern of unhappy emotion, an administrator can then speak to the student and find out what might be going on in their home life or if they need to see a counselor. If a computer could give insight to happy or sad emotions, what other emotions could it detect?

The knowledge of how a student learns or the level of engagment they have within the classroom is a key component to modifying lessons and ensuring the most enriching education for a certain individual. Within the article, Alto inserts a quote from Thomas Huang, a professor, in which he says, ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (Alto 6). This means that opportuinities for a student to get a more indivualized education increase, and teachers will have the ability to revise lessons in order to adjust to level of understanding majority of students have. It would also create a tremendous chance for the students who are falling below average to be identified and recieve the propering tutoring needed. Would these new adjustments then lead to a better understanding of learning styles?

Each individual in a classroom has a unique way of learning that requires attention and adaption on the lesson in order to fully let the student reach their potential to excell with their education. The author claims that the technology could, ""...modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (Alto 6). This gives the information that the system could be able to analyze the way students learn, and give access to various learning styles of their student. This would enable them to then adhere to the students education needs, and therefore open doors to make break throughs with children that had been struggling.

There are many factors to consider when contemplating the use of this technology in the classroom. Although, the overall result of putting this system in place would be positive. The ability to detect students emotions will enable instructors to teach more attentively to each indivdual student, causing the childs achievement level to rise snd their education to strengthen. Enriching education and making it personal to the student will in time increase passing test scores, the number of college graduates, and literacy rate. Schools should consider encorperating the FACS technology in order to obtain a brighter, better future for their kids and country. ",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8

Although all of the facial recognition sounds good, there are some parts to it that could be bad. There are many things that could turn out to be negative.

I believe he is trying to say that teachers don't do enough so we have to bring in a computer instructor to make it less boring. This is not only bad for the students, but also the teachers.

This also can be a distraction in class. While the teacher is giving a lecture about an important skill that students need to learn, there are students in the back of the classroom trying to mess around with the facial coding system by trying different faces and causing a disruption. Kids are easily distracted and this is just another distraction from keeping kids engaged and focused on the studies that they will need for the rest of their life.

While a child is learning, for instance, a math program site, they could be trying to get in it but there are ads that pop up ,in paragrah 6 it states that ""if you smile when a Web ad apperars on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" If a child looks away from the computer at his/her friend to wait for he ad to be over that he/she doesn't want, and smiles while glancing down to the screen to see if the ad is over, the computer could take this as a happy signal for the ad. So then it will play another one that is similar to the ad that the child did not want.

This computer software could stop this from happening and overall help students have a better experience at school when trying to learn. In paragraph six Dr. Huang talks about how this could revolutionize a classroom, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This would overall help a teacher know when someone is confused so they can help them after class or talk to them more in-depth about the lesson. This invention could hep out many of students that find lessons to be very hard and don't know how to do whatever the instructor is teaching. This software could also modify the lesson that an instructor is teaching so that it is easier for a student to grasp.

Many teachers present day don't necessarily care if the students are learning what they are teaching, but just the fact that they are teaching it gives them a clear concious. This computer program could give the teachers an alert saying that someone isn't getting the lesson because they are confused with a certain topic that the teacher talked about during the class. They could then modify their lesson so that it is easier for everyone to learn. An example of evidence from the text of this is when Dr. Huang talks about how using this technology teachers could modify their lesson so that it would be easier for their students to learn, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This helps point to the fact that it could help everyday teachers know when their students aren't completely grasping the lesson that they are teaching. This technology could also help people have more empathy for each other.

People present day are always talking about how nobody has any empathy for each other. This software could fix this especially in the classroom. A student would know when their fellow student would be sad and they would be able to talk to them and help them overcome the sadness. Another reason empathy may happen would because we unconciously imitate other people's facial expressions. Here is a quote from this article where the author, Nick D'Alto is talking about how this technology could cause empathy, ""Empathy may happen because we unconciously imitate another person's facial expressions."" This would help people show more empathy for each other. Overall this would be a great addition to the classroom.

Having this software in a classroom setting would stop students from becoming confused from a lesson, help modify the lesson so that an instructor could make the lesson more understandable for students, and give people more empathy. These reason give evidence that having this computer software in a classroom would not only benefit the students but benefit the teachers as well by giving them that peace of mind that their students get the lesson that they are teaching.

CC3A5AD37340,"In my opinion i feel like the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable. I think its not a good idea of technology reading our emotions. Some people do have hard time showing their feelings but its either because they are hurt or scared. Others just show their feelings and emotions. Those are the kind of people that have been hurt but still move on with their lifes. Might take them a couple of days, weeks, months or maybe even years. This generation has changed there is a lot of technology now days. Us as humans we do what we like and work on what we like to do he express our emotions on what we do.

On the other hand using technology is kind of a good idea for people that have trouble showing their feelings and emotions are the kind of people that would us technology. These kind of people that are scared to show their emotions would get this so they could get a little help to try to show their emotions. But for another reason the same people that have hard time showing their emotions are the one who would probably not use technology.

For example using technology to show the Mone Lisa painting emotions would be 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguste, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. All of that doesnt sound right why not just express what you feel your emotions, Just be yourselfs.

On the other hand another reason why people are scared to show their emotions and feelings is because the care about what other people think about them. That is one thing people should not care about do whatever makes you happy making good decisions. But happy is what everyone needs to be we only live once and why not spend it with the ones we love and that make us happy, ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
CE5A5A557889,"You now that in the paint of the Mona LIsa she is"" 83 percent happy, 9 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"", (D'Alto 1). How we know that because a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System this technology can read your face and tell how you feeling. This new technology is valuable because this is a better way in which humans and computers can release, also the doctor who do this study the emotions and expressions before do this technology and because people communicate more in facial expressions than in words.

The facial Action Coding System is a relationship between humans and computers ""Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate, (D'Alto 1). This show how this invent help humans and computers to communicate and understand better. This is important because show how in this time when everything is technology is important that we understand better with the technology and technology understand us better too so this new invent help a lot in the communication between humands and computers.

This new invent is valuable because the creator of this before doing this technology study the emotions and the facial expressions ""Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul (creator of facial action coding system). Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness- and then associated each with characteristics movements of the facial muscles,"" (D'Alto 1). This show how this new technology its valuable. The inventor of this with a psychologist study the emotions and then the movements of the facial muscles. This is important because we can conclude that the emotions and the expression in the Facial Action Coding System are real like the humans expressions and emotions.

Also people communicate more in facial expressions than in word ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication Dr. Huang, "" (D'Alto 1). This mean most humans communicate with expressions and not word. Its more easy for humans make a facial movement that express his emotion that tell someone how he feel. This is important because show how this invent understand better the humans and not neccesary with word, this understand humans with only his expression.

In conclusion we can see how this new technology is valuable. We can conclude that the Facial Action Coding System is a better way in the communication between humans and computers. Is important because at this time everything is technology. Also we can conclude that the inventor study emotions and facial expressions before do the invent. We can infer that the emotions and expression are fact like that the humans do and fell. Humans also communicate more with expression than word so this is very good manner to communicate between humans and computers.   ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
9B0EBE9AD33F,"The FACS

FACS got your attenshion right yeah the FACS is a facial action coding system. The FACS can tell the person how the the person feels just by looking at there face like and exmaple is the Mona Lisa they read irs face withe the FACS. They said it was 83% happy 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry. It is useful but i dont think it should be used in classrooms to read students. 3 reasons why I think thats teh FACS should't be allowed in school are sometimes people dont want to talk about ther lifes in school and another reason is that it would go to kids personal lifes and the last reason is it may make kids feel weird knowing that others know how they feel and so will there parents .

Going back to the first reason that may sometimes people dont want to talk about ther lifes in school. Sometimes people dont want to talk about ther lifes in school kids may think others kids will make of them for being sad or fearful. An exmaple of a kid being scared of what other will think of them for being scared or super kind are bullies. Bullies most of time become the way they are is becaues they feel like others will hate them the way they are or hey have been juged becaues of there feelings.

Lets get into another reason that the FACS would be a bad thing to have in schools is that it would go to kids personal lifes and most kids dont like talking about they'r home life. you may say it would take some presser off the kids if they feel bad or sad and we could talk to them. But some kids that don't want to talk about it and the kids that feel ok will feel like the sad kids get more attenshion so will want to be sad. Like when i was younger i used to want attenchion so if kids find a key to get attenshion they will want to be sad.

The last reason is it may make kids feel weird knowing that others know how they feel. Also it may make the kids parents feel weird or angry becaues they probly dont want people basicly spying on there kids. If i were one of the kids dad i would want the school spying on my kid. If alots of parents feel that way and which schools the school with the FACS will lose lots of money.

3 reasons why I think thats teh FACS should't be allowed in school are sometimes people dont want to talk about ther lifes in school and another reason is that it would go to kids personal lifes and the last reason is it may make kids feel weird knowing that others know how they feel and so will there parents.

This new technology is called the Facial Action Coding System, or FACS for short. The scientists who created this new technology believe it would be very useful if integrated into different aspects of peoples lives. Ones of their most prominent suggestions being in classroom computers.

Using the new technology of FACS in schools would be very useful. It could sense when a student is having a difficult time with an assignment, or is confused about the lesson being taught. This way it could change the teaching method to one the student understands more. Then it would use that method more often, and the student would be able to learn more. "" ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" "". It could also sense when the student isn't quite interested in the lesson. So the FACS technology could change it to one that captivates the students attention more.

In sum, using this new technology that can detect emotions in the classroom would be very useful. It would be able to modify a students learning method based on their productivity.

With a majority of communication being nonverbal it can be hard to understand even for humans , technology being able to pick up on it would be alot easier and not feel as intrusive as the student having to explain themselve to the teacher/learning coach.

I completly agree with this becaus most all schools now are useing computer. So if we are learning off of a comperter that can recogniz when i am confused i think that i would have better grades because the computer would adjust itself so that i can learn it another way that i might understand better. Also i think that this would just be cool to have because it could also detect when you are bored. so when and if you get bored during a lesson the computer could adjust itsef to make the activity or lesson more appeling to the eye.

But the down side of this is that it can only recognize certain emotions such as happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. But what if you have a diffrent emotion than that then what will the computer do when that happens just keep going how it is or will it try something new. By this passage i have learned that every thing in this would is changeing and that new technology is comeing out. But will this Facial Action Coding System really help children and teans lean new way that they understand i don't know but for now I agree that all computers should get this system becaue i know that if it really works that the pasage says that it does then i know that i would understand lessons in school way better than what i do now because it will adjust to how i like to learn and waht i find boring in the lessons that i am learning.

Now, scientist want to bring computers that can read our facial expressions into the classrooms. People believe this technology will shape our future as students and this is why they are wrong.

Bringing computers that read our facial expressions into classrooms is an invasion of privacy for students. If a computer is able to see our expressions while we are reading articles or doing video surgery, this means that our computers are recording our every move.

""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements - in a real face."" This quote from the article states that our computers are watching us to see if we are pleased or unsatisfied with what we are looking at. They believe this new technology is a great idea but they do not realize people can hack into these systems. When hackers get into these systems, they can watch you and what you do, which is invasion of privacy.

A303513AA882,"Technology is extremely helpful in our everyday lives and is a great way to interact with people. We use it to gather information and learn, as well as overall communicating with people all over the world. But do we really need it to guide us on human emotion? Emotional technology could actually keep us from understanding people on our own, and could make us too dependent on electronics.

Do you have a friend or family member who always knows how you're feeling even if you're trying to hide it? Analyzing other people's emotions is a good way for people to understand eachother and to grow close with one another. But technology takes away our ability to do that on our own. The author of ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" states, ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"". This is clearly a way to show how humans minds naturally can do the same job as the Facial Action Coding System. If humans rely on computers and technology to tell us how we or other people are feeling, we don't need to figure it out on our own. And if we are always relying on technology and not using our own experiences and analytical skills, then we will eventually lose our abilities to understand others on our own. People in the modern day are already very dependent on technology, we can not let it tear down our social skills. Having an emotion generator can slowly tear at people's social skills and will make us less able to relate to people. Identifying other's feelings can give people a sense of closeness, understanding, and relation to that other person, and if we constantly rely on technology to do those things for us, it would seem as though we are losing connection from person to person, and are making it a connection from person to technology.

Some people believe that technology is keeping us from the simple things in life, and we are more engaged in our cell phones than engaging with people or nature or any of our surroundings. So in that particular case, would using technology to read people make us to connected with electronics, or would it allow us to further connect with people? The answer is fairly simple. Nobody knows you better than you know yourself, and that means that nobody knows people better than people themselves. We have been able to read people's faces and emotions since the beginning of time, and are still currently able to. No technology can read the psychology of humans as well as humans likely can. So why would we add the element of technology to interfere with person to person contact? It is important that people are able to associate with other people without depending on other resources, and including technology to help us would in the long run actually hinder us. A person had to understand humans enough to create this kind of technology, so instead of making everyone dependent on technology, why don't we allow people to understand humans more on their own?

In conclusion, although technology can be useful, technology determining emotions could effect our generation in a negative way. Humans were born being able to understand basic human emotion, and we should not take away that skill from others through relying on technology.

The computer can tell if your bored or not. they have indicated the difference between a genuine smile and a forced smile. A real smile or in other words the Ztgomatic major ( muscles that begain at your cheek bones) lift the corners of your mouth. In a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the Zygomatic major and a different muscle called the risorius.

To start off, expressions can not forsure tell what that person is feeling. I have seen people so mad but continue throughout their day like everything is fine. Plus, if that student is just doing a fake smile, that does not mean that they are really happy. The FACS can not read emotions but reads the emotions it thinks you are feeling because of what your facial expression is.

Therefore, to end my argument, in paragraph 9 it says that contracting your smile muscles can help you feel slightly happy.

For a solfware that can change the learning process just for you to make it more challenging or make it easier just for is amazing.

Now It can find interesting things you like to read and it make people want to read. This machine also help the teachers cause they can't help every student if they have a class of 30 student.

This is were this solfware go wrong human have way more then six emotions. These emotion we have is very complicated to the point that we don't understand them some times.

Finally, this technology could help modify lessons and increase student productivity.

This technology could give teachers more insight on how their students really feel due to its extroardinary system. Paragraph 3 talks about how the process begins, cause the big question here might be, "" Can you actually ""calculate"" emotions- like math problems?"" Or, ""How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"" The text states how the process includes constructing a 3-D computer model of the face and how with the work of physhologists the emotions can be defined. If this system is as valauable as the text states it to be, then letting a teacher know how the students actually feel could be effecient to the the teacher, because they can try to comprehend the students and show their support to them as well. Nowadays teachers seem to think that they are the only ones with problems which is not at all true.

This technology could also be of value if it even lead to letting classmates know that they are not the only ones dealing with the emotions that they have, in fact many others could feel the exact way. Sometimes students feel that they are dealing with emotions alone. This technology could change that. Letting other students know of how a class mate is feeling could be very helpful.

If I was a teacher in high school i would use this tool. There are so many ways that I would be able to help students in calss. If a student was having a bad day I would be able to know becasue of the software tool. I would be able to know if a student was struggling in class or that if a student was becoming bored in class.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
65C9A335816D,"How do we know if are feeling are real or not? When something happens to a person that is negitive. That person usall has a hard time getting though it. They try and hid there emotions for the people around them. That is there choice some people are quit and do not like to talk about there feeling and other like to open up and talk. It would be wrong if this system came out and is would show others how people are reallly feeling. Instead of the Facial Action Coding System showing our feeling it would be taking are feeling away in a sense. This Facial Action coding system is showing up everywehere, in classrooms, in the theathed and around the house. People can never hide for there true emotions.

How this works in a classroom. A computer in a classroom can reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored. And his advance technology can change the lesson and make the lesson essaier so the kids can understand it. This is wrong becasue if a kid does not get something they usally raise his or her hadn and asks a question. Kid would not do that becasue the computer is just changing it for them. The kid would lose a lot of people skill. Which are very importan to learn as a kid. Where is the teacher, does this system just replace the teachers all over the world. or do we still have them and the computers just tell them what to teach and what to said. This system could make the kids very self contes too becasue the system is just telling the kids that they do not understand it and that they need the information to be dumbed down for them. This system does not belong in a classroom.

People use this while looking in a mirror because they want to know if looking in a mirror suggest an a emotion. This system says that the musculs in our face know the different between a genunie smaile and a forced one. Why does it matter a smile is a smile. The only people that would be able to tell the differnce are the people that you are really close with. people that do not know you would not even care about your emotions. the system is pointless people have the right to hide there emotions. And if they want to share them witht the people that they are cloase to then good for them. This system should have be used when you look at yourself in a mirror. You personal should know what your emtionsa and feelings are.

People use this on stage actors use it to make more emotion on stage. And again why do we need this. If you are a weel tought actor you should not need a mechain to make emotions or faces for you. The hole point of being an actor is becasue you are good at expressing you feelings. How do the comman people know if the person is a good actor if these meachines are making their faceal expressions. This system is unneed in the arts the actors are capale of making there own faces and emotions.

Why do we need to know the percents of emotions. Do some people really care that much that they need to make it a math . It is very unhealth to make every little thing excat. Not everythiing is perfect nor will it ever be. Our emotions should not become a math proble. becaue the only person that can truly solve it is yourself. Emotions can be all over the place but that is apart of life. And if we had a system to make every little emotion perfect, then how would we learn. How would we know what hurt feels like how would we deal with that hurt. Maybe this system tells you that your 20% happy 50% hurting. It makes your think that is right. Thats how you really feel, computers can not tell you how to feel.

I feel like this system is telling you how to feel. When the people used the video imagery to see what the peainting would look like with a smile. That was okay becasue they were just seeing they were not changing anything perimatal. when you do soemthignfor fun to see what it looks like that is okay. But when you start to make it real. That is what is wrong making our emtions a math problam, telling us how to feel, and what emotions to feel when we are look in the mirror. That is not okay its wrong, you have to let us learn for our emotions in order to change them for the better. If we are sad then find somehting to make us happy. If we want to be alone let us be alone. Let use be human and feel are own emotions. ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
9FE4034401E9,"Would the use of technology to read emotional express be valuable in class?

The use of technnolgy is very useful in th classroom, it helps students with many tasks. Using tecnology to read emotional expressions would be great way of helping teachers knowing how their student feels during class or during a lession. The process of using to technology to read emotions is when a computer conducts a 3-D computer model of the face. The face has 44 major muscels that the computer memorises. Eckman has classified 6 basic emotions ""happiness, surprise, anger, digust, fear, and sadness"".

Most facial expressions are universal, even though many people show many kinds of emotion video imagry can track these kinds of facial movements. When you look a friends you can tell how their feeling by the look on their face. But most people struggle at describing how they feel. Using this technology at school will let teachers know if a student is having a bad day and they can help them feel better or make their day better. Classrooms can start by having a Classroom computer letting the teacher know if a student is understanding the lession by their facial expression. If most of the class show a facial expression that they are not understanding the lession the teacher may change the lesson to make sure students learn it. Most students in class room are to shy or pershaps scared to answer or question thinking they will get it wrong, with new technology teachers will know how the students feels about gettin answers wrong or feeling shy in the class room.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
5E497E52DA95,"The author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that enables computers to identify human emotions sould be valuable. I would want to see people's different emotions from the face from the past and today. This could be a new science technology that we ever made. It's just like a math and science subject, but trying to figure out more of different people's emotions. They could be angry or happy or have any other emotions.

This technology would be great for school education, maybe in college. It could be a new subject for a science class. For these six emotions for the class, it would be a great class to pass a high school class. Doing this is pretty cool to do. Out of all the science classes and math classes it could prove that emotions for humans would be great.

That is what we should do for the future science class talking about emotions. It would be great for it to pass a science class in high school, or college.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
6A0FADF28A04,"Reading this article on ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" there would have to be an agreement on technology to read the emotional expressions of students. Well technology to begin with now adays is so advanced almost anything is possible. The reasoning behind how computers can read peoples emotions is proven by The Facial Action Coding System.

The sensors in a computer can decode how you are feeling just by the movement in a persons face called the ""action unit."" Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS, has already classified the six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. This is based off the movement of our facial muscles. There are different muscles in your face that help our cheeks, eyes, mouth and forehead to move different ways when we make different facial expressions. When we are angry, we squint our forehead together and our mouth tightens. When we are happy, the eyes squint and rise, along with our cheeks and mouth. it opens wide and the corners of our mouth also rise. along with our other emotions, FACS detects the movement of these muscles and determines whether we are happy or just faking it. Even by the slightest different movement, when a smile is on your face but isnt't real. Everyday, its seen on someones face normally their true emotion. If a person is smiling but not a big, and you are surrounded by this person, you may be able to tell if it's real or not. FACS proved that it van detect emotion through videos, images, or even in a mona lisa painting.

Yes, I agree with the article that was written becuase not only from the evidence that was supported in the article, everyone has put on a face that wasn't real and had been called out on it. Even the expressions a person makes are instinctual. When you get angry, sad, or happy, you make a face unintentionally before you even think about it. A person doesn't put on a front when they stub there toe. That persons face will cringe and they may cry or scream. FACS is accurate and even without it, it's sort of a given how someone is feeling by their facial expressions.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
40EC38BC0B85,"To start off, I think the technology to read emotional espressions of students is vulnerable because in todays society not a lot of people are great at socializing, their faces and actions speak louder than theirown words. Basically saying that students and teachers should know somethng is wrong with the person just by looking at their face and the expressions they're portraying.

In the article it states that the peoples faces don't lie and that this is a pro because it helps detect wheather a person is lying or not. On paragrapgh #8 it sites ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" Clearly, right there it states that we could know wheather a big person we look up towards to like our president could be lying to us or not just by simply using this advance computer technology to recognize human facial expressions. This is also a gret opportunity for humans and computers to develop better ways to communiacte. It's a great big step forward in society too. If you're not great at expressing how you feel verbally maybe you're better just facialy expressing it without saying a single word. This amamzing technology can even identify mixed emotions. In the article it staes that ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery. Most humans communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" says Dr. Huang. This means your computer could know how you feel without saying a single wrord. I also think this an advanatge to school consuelors because students sometime have trouble in school and don't really like to talk about their feelings.

To conclude, I think the technology to read emotionals expressions should be vulnerable to students and the teachers as well. Why? Becasuse a lot of people can struggle with anxiety/social problems and they just need somepone to talk to but just don't know how. This is why computer science is helpful to when it comes to situations like this. ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

This could be helpful for teachers to know if they should go more in depth on the topic or should they stop and move onto something more interesting. Being on an un interested topic for so long can cause students to get off topic, be distracted, play games, sleep. In the article it gives out examples how they could possibly test this new software out. They thought of an idea with the use or ads that pop up constantly on website. They came up with the idea that they can use the ads to tell the encode of how you feel about the ad if you smile at it. If you smile at it, a simlilar ad will show up next.

I get frustrated all of the time with my work and I don't alway have a teacher right there with me to ask how to do something or to help me every time i'm stuck on a problem. I think it would be great and super convient, especially for the kids who need a little extra help on their assignments. This essay also goes to show how technology is taking over the world, sooner or later there will be no going to school, it will all be over computers from home. I think that this could really help some kids out but what if you get a text message and you start smiling about that and it thinks you are doing great so it doesn't modify it for you?

I also think that just because we have all this new and improved technolgy shouldn't mean to use it.

One reason I say it woulldn't be important to to have a facial regontion in a class for students is because maybe the kid is angery or sad and if you find that out then talk to them about it it could bring up bad memories so the kid would eventualy just shut down and not talk at all.

Another reason is that you could trigger some built up anger and then they could cause a bunch of unneeded choas or potentiely they could judt have enough of the bull crap and take matters into their own hands and i'm just saying but it could also cause more school shootings and this point in the U.S we don't need that on our hands.

the final reason is that anymore technology is getting to out of hand in eyes like whatever happend to going outside and having fun instead sitting in frount of a screen play your life away to video games when we could do something to make this world a better place.

3F03E1A2249E,"Today, technology in classrooms is huge. Almost all classrooms use technology nearly everyday. However, not everyone of them is effective because they are easier to slack off on without having a human to tell them to continue on even after they are bored, tired and even confused. Dr. Thomas Huang decided to create a system to help with this problem. He made a system called FACS or Facial Action Coding System. This system on a computer, reads emotions that on displayed on peoples face.

There are 44 major muscles in the human face. Each one of these muscles helps researchers find new ways to read emotions. Dr. Thomas Huang is one of these researchers. Dr. Huang says, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"". He means by this that because there are so many different muscles in your face, and them all being able to show different emotions, there is an endless amount of expressions to be made. For example, you can probabaly read your friends face and see what kind of day they are having by reading the emotion on their face. Unlike the smart Facial Action Coding System, we are not able to completely describe each facial trait showed by our friend, although we can still tell their state of emotion. For example when using FACS, researchers were able to tell that Leonardo da Vinci's Renaissance painting, Mona Lisa was 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful and 2% angry.

It is thought that the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) could help students better in the classrom. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Haung predicted. He also stated that if the FACS could recognize taht on students faces, it could also modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor would. Dr. Huang also states ""Most human communication is nonverball, including emotional communication,"". Even though this system could prove to be effective, not all students are only learning on computers and are learning verbally from a teacher. A teacher is unable to identify the exact percent of each emotion you feel but can still read your emotions just as your friend would.

Nick D'Alto, the author of Making Mona Lisa Smile, gives us an example of demonstration we could try. ""While looking in the mirror: 1. Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth. 2. Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling ('crow's-feet"") at the corners of your eyes. 3. Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes."". By having a partner guess which emotion your are portraying, he is doing as the FACS would. Your partner probabaly would have guessed happy. The computers would have been able to tell that you are feeling happy, and continue on with your work. However, if you were to have been looking confused, the computer would stop, and try to help explain the problem to you.

The computers could very easily help in the classrooms to make students work to the best of their ability. By being able to read emotions, the computers will make it harder for students to slack off while previoulsy it would have been moderatly easy. Humans perform these face ""calculations"" everyday without realizing it. Now the FACS system can join along with us and then some by creating a better work environemnt for the students.

93FD96ADB996,"Human emotions have been around about as long as humans have. For milenia humans have been able to convey feelings through facial expressions for many hundreds of years. Peole have also figured out ways to fake or force emotions if they feel it necessary and have been doing so for hundreds of years. While classrooms are newer but feel boring to most,they are a big part of life. Classrooms might be boring, and while it has become possible to use new technology to make learning fun, but this begs the question, is it practical?

Computers are newer and facial recognition is on the rise but is the facial recognition software fit for a classroom? Facial recognition software might be available,but as the article mentions,personal computers can't handle the software. How are schools supposed to use something that requires a larger computer with only a small amount of money to spend? The article also doesn't mention how costly the software itself is so it could be too costly for schools. Most schools simply do not have the kind of money required for this new technology.

The new software could be used to make lesson plans more fun but is that practical. Ignoring how the schools would get this new software,the practical use of it has a cost of its own. Changing lesson plans to be more fun may sound practical,but what about the cost and different types of learning? There are different types of learning,auditory,visual,hands on,and probably more types of learning,but how are schools supposed to cater to those who like to learn differently than the rest? The methods of putting these other types of learning into effect would be far too costly for most schools an would probably require even more software and other technology.

The costs of practical facial expression recognition software usage are big but ignoring that, will people accept a comuter watching their facial expressions? Though the article mentions about facial expressions and analyzing them, it fails to take into account how people feel about this. According to the article,this software could be used to tell if a student is bored,but would students be comfortable with a machine that could tell how they were feeling just watching them as it taught? Many students would feel uncomfortable being watched constantly especially by a computer that could analyze how they were feeling. Not to mention the fact that for some forms of learning the computer might be forced to move around with the help of other technology to give examples which might make students more uncomfortable.

In conclusion while facial reading software seems like a good idea,maybe it isn't. The software wouldn't be compatible with school computers. The cost of replacing the computers and putting the new and more fun learning techniques into practice would be very costly. Many students would feel uncomfortable with this new technology and some things students are forced to learn simply can't be made fun easily.

Reading students facial expressions could help see if they need help or go to the councilars office. Using this technology teachers can use it to see if their students are confused or lost while doing their work. If a student is angry it can read their facial expression then the teacher could send them out into the hall.

The technology could even possibly know when a fight is about to happen between two students reading their facial expressions. Empathy can happen when using this technology. It can be used to see if someone is lying or telling the truth. Lastly it can be used to conduct a classroom.

46145F4A6009,"The use of this technology called the Facial Action Coding System is not valuable to read students' emotional expressions. Not all expressions on a students face can be readable. Some students may have a natural expressions but show it differently. How accurate are these calculations for these expressions really?

In the article it states ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness"" but what about emotions that go further and can be shown or thought to be as a basic expression ? More emotions are linked to the basic emotions if a person is to have guilt but show a face of anger but actually they are sad and cover it. The Facial Action Coding System just reads the expressions but not feelings of the students.

Some students have natural expressions. We have friends that have a natural 'mean mug' but are in reality happy or just calm this system could get it confused with an angry face. In the article it states ""The facial expressions for each emotion are univeral."",meaning there is a wide range of emotions but could this system actually detect the difference between two similar faces of a person that makes the same face alot. In the article it also states

""For,example your frontalis pars lateralis muscle(above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" so for the students who have a natural facial structure it will most likely be harder to detect their actual emotion.

The article starts off by saying ""Shes 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" Although the system recognizes these expressions they are not actually reading her thoughts so they do not actually know the feelings of Mona Lisa and just are basing it off her expression. In this article it also states ""Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)"" but how accurate is this persons face against others they could be showing emotions also.

In conclusion, this is why the system should not be a value to read people expressions. It doesnt have a wide enough range for each person. The system bases it off others neutral faces. People structures are different from one another and have different meanings. The system does not give you actual feelings and just read faces.

7DCCED5150F8,"The Facial Action Coding system. It can read almost any face, and tell weither what emotion you have having. You could use this for many diffrent things such as; busting a crimanal, telling if a person around you acully is happy around you, or even if someone is lying to you. But one other important thing this technology can be used for is school.

Lets say you were at school and you were getting bullied or you werent having a good day. You are trying to hide your emotions but your quiet good at it. But the moment you sit down at a computer, it scans your face and it says that you are sad/depressed. The moment the computer reads your face it can alert the teacher and it can tell if the student is enjoying or disliking the class or school in general. Then, when the teacher knows his/her emoiton, he could ask the student why they are feeling this way and if they need to talk. It could make the students feel special and that they dont need to hide there emotions from people and can feel totally comfortable expressing themselves.

Even with that sanificant factor of helping children out with there emotions, there is also some cons about have this system. Facial Action Coding System could almost make the parents a bit worried about there children and be wondering would it could be doing. What if foreigner parties start to hack the system. There could be major problems such as; knowing who you are, having your facial ID, and a chance of getting captured. Some parents are really strict with their children not letting them show there face to a camera just because they are aware of the dangers that could happen.

Another con is that the system could malfunction. Since is sends the information and emotion to teacher/parents the teacher could get worried and ask why this student has this emotion but little do they know that there was wrong information sent. Lets say the student his sitting as his desk and the system scanned his face over a multitude of facial moment and it says your sad, but on the inside you are acually fairly happy. Then the teacher could ask you why he or she is sad, and would try to help him out. But little do they know is that he really happy and something went wrong with the system. It would be pointless, there would be no advantage in having this. It would take time out of your day and there could be a whole ordeal about weither your sad or happy.

But also the Facial Action Coding System could help us find out is is someone has cheated on a test, or is mad at another student. It can prevent many of dangerous thing from happening in the school such as a school shooting for example. If a student was angry 24/7 at school it could aller and worry the teachers that something drastic could happen and a gun could be pulled out. But you can prevent that from happening with the Facial Coding System, you could see that the student is mad all the time and the teachers could reach out and help the student before something drastic happens.

Over all I think it would be a great idea to have a system like this in our schools today because some people are really hurting on the inside, and sometimes us humans can not tell weither if the person is sad, mad, or happy. We could prevent self harm with this! We could stop many of things from happening in our schools today. I think every school should start to incorporate this system into there labtops and computers because it could really help a student out. We could make people the outcasts feel important for once. It would make there day knowing the fact that somone cares about them.

We could help a lot of things we do in school today, it was be a good benefit factor having this system in schools. ",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8
1683314A34F5,"I think that the new technology, FACS

which stands for facial action coding system is valuable. Because knowing how others are feeling can help develop stronger relationships and bonds with friends and family. And can also help a person console another person if they are feeling sad, lonely, and angry, even if the other person doesn't show their true emotions/ feelings.

And the technology FACS

can recognize different human emotions such as sadness or happiness even if the person's face doesn't have any emotion or expressions on it.

And we could also learn more on how our emotions change from time to time and why they change.

And could help develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate.

And it would help people that have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, and other emotions like that.

And it may help with teaching students. Like, say if a person is bored they probably won't learn as much as someone who isn't bored. Or that if someone is confused they don't really learn anything and it doesn't really help them focus either. But someone who isn't confused or isn't bored will likely learn better than those who are confused or bored.

If it is something that the student likes or is intersted it they will likely listen and probably won't be confused nor bored. But if it is something that they don't really like or it isn't interesting to them then they may not pay attention to it and may get bored and/or get confused.

And may help people learn and grow well.

And also if the person learning doesn't really like the lesson or is not interested or is bored or confused then the computer can change the lesson to something that the student will probably like and not be bored or confused with anything on or in the lesson. Or the computer can suggest something else or another lesson for the student to do to see if they do better in the lesson and enjoy it more and focus more.

It can improve education and how well students know everything and can encourage good attitudes and positive things in the present and the future.

Also, it can help encourage people to talk more often and make friends and to also encourage people to help others and things like that.

And maybe advise teachers in a way to make the lesson their teaching more enjoyable and helpful by playing games or letting students have a group of partners to help them and such.

And may help students have better grades/ do better in school and maybe even do better in extra- curricular activities such as sports.

And help student focus on the things they need to do. And help the teachers to make lessons where it will help the students learn better and be more fun for them.

May also inspire people to work harder or more and do different things and come up with new or different ideas and such. And may even motivate the person to do something that they want to do or accomplish.

5B9B01174564,"This technology is not important in a classroom setting, because why spend so much money on something the human eye can do? According to the text, in paragraph 5, it states, ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" They add this here to explain what the technology is seeing, but really, if you think about it, it's really saying that we can already do what this equipment can for much cheaper. The only way I see this peice of technology would be useful, is when students get confused while working on a device. According to paragraph 6, it states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" While this is an interesting factor, we can also look at how many people these days ""freak out"" because, supposedly, the FBI is watching us through our computer cameras, and now we're welcoming technology because it can read our emotions? Someone could easily see this as an opportunity to hack into the cameras at the school, and watch children. Nobody would be aware of what is really happening, and the preditor would get away with watching students while they're trying to do their work. I do not see this sort of technology as a reliable source because we can do the same thing by looking at a person, and we're welcoming technology into schools that could easily get hacked, and all of a sudden, we have unknown people watching our students while in school.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
4DD3D787193A,"The new technology called the ""Facial Coding Sytem""is the best technology ever. It has a veriety of features like the 3-D model,the recognizition emotion face,annd the math homework app .

The 3-D model is one way why people should choose this technology because if you have a 3-D model computer then everything looks big and clear. This proves that now and days people like to watch thing and look at things big and clear. So that is why you should take this technology.

The recognize emotion is another reason why this is a nice technology. For example,this shows how you feel or the way you expressions look. The author says,""Using video imagery,the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements-in real life or in the painted face of Mona Lisa.""This proves that the facial emotion can work on anything whether is a person or a picture of someone.

The math homework is the last reason why you should buy this technology. In fact this is also a part of the emotion senser like whether if you feel like doing it or not. For examle,in the text it says,""Hold on! Can we actually calculate emotions-like mathwork.""This proves that the technology can tell if we want to do something or not. Emotion in the new technology can really determine a person.

This software is the lastest invention from Prof. The six basic emotions humans have can be read or showed by this Facial Action Coding System. This new technology is being tested to see if it is valuable in the classroom to read the emotional expressions of students. I belive this tecnology wouldn't be valuable in the classroom or learning enviroment. This technology doesnt benifit the students learning or relate to their school subjects.

Facial Action coding System can calculate human emotional expressions. It calculates how you feel or waht you are feeling. I don't think this software would be valuable in the classroom because it is invading the kids personal space. Having the teachers or the computers always knowing how you feel is creepy. In the artical ""Making Mona Lisa Simle"" it states that humans perform this task or calculation of reading people's emotions everyday. The artical also states that humans most likly can tell how otheres or how their friends are feeling by looking at their faical expressings. Having Facial Acton Coding System in the classroom would just be unessasary and invading others personal space.

This software or technology only reads humans emotional expressions, it does'nt teach anything or help people learn anything benifiting to school. If this technology was to be put into classrooms it wouldnt be benifiting to the kids or teaching them anything related to their school work. The artical states that the computer would be able to tell when a student is confused or bored while doing a leason. Most schools don't even teach leasons on the computer a teacher teaches them the leason they are learning. Also some kids or even their parents wouldn't want a computer to be reading their childrens emotions 24/7, also the students may not want to be monitored all the time aswell. This technology just isn't benificial to the learning enviroment in that sort of way.

The software update, the Facial Action Coding System is cool on how it reads humans emotions and tells you how they are feeling, but it just isn't valuable to classrooms or the learning enviroment. This software invades otheres person sapce by always monitoring their emotional expressions and calculating how u feel. Some people might find it creepy on the fact they are always being read by this new technology. This new technology isn't valuable to classrooms also because it it is not benifical to kids learning.

D7F4D3366332,"The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) machine developed by Dr. Paul Eckman is turning the tides of facial expression recognition. It is able to distinguish individual expressions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness which humans can find hard to do making it vital to being infused into the use of schools. Teachers would be able to learn more of their students and improve on their curriculums in order to satisfy the needs of their students. The FACS machine would be able to tell whether a student is lying, needs emotional support and help, and see whether they understand the lesson or not making the machine essential to school life.

When it comes to school, students will not always tell the truth. They may lie about not doing their homework or be untruthful about whether they were involved in a fight. The FACS machine could solve that issue as it is able to determine whether someone is lying or not based on their expression which is stated in the quote,"" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This machine is able to examine the details of one's face to find out if they are lying or not. It examines the key traits of each specific emotion and if they are not meant, that is how it knows whther the truth has been told or not. Students will no longer bee able to weasel their way out of punishment due to their superior lying skills as the FACS machine is able to see through the lies. This is not the only thing this machine can do though for schools.

This mechanism is able to determine the emotions of a student and see if they need help or not. It can read a total of six emotions with some branches coming off of those emotions. The six emotions are stated in the quote,"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" The machine is able to determine whether a student is in distress or not thus telling the teacher to help the student out with the problem that they are facing. The teacher would be able to help the student cope and deal with their emotional sadness or anger and tell them how to deal with it in order to assist them in getting through it. This is not the end though of what this incredible machine can do for a school.

Students may not understand a lesson and are having troubles getting through it. SInce humans find the task of reading emotions diffficult, a teacher may not be able to see this and help the student out but this machine can deal with that problem too. How the machine deals with this horrible issue is state in the statement,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This quote shows how the FACS mechanism would be able to tell if a student is bored which would signal the teacher to modiffy the lesson in order for it to be better understood. Students would no longer have to complain about not understanding their homework or curriculum. This would allow for better grades and better lives for the students in the future.

In conclusion, the FACS machine would be essential to the lives of students in a classroom. Teachers would b able to make the experience of school even better than it is already and easier than it is already. No student would have to struggle anymore which is key to the success of a school as everyone would learn greatly and effecttively. The machine would deal with the problems of whether a student is telling the truth or not, whether a student is in need of emotional support or not, and whether a student needs help understanding the curriculum and lesson that they are learning.",6,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,1.0
7DE7AE0BEF8C,"Technology is a fast growing resource in the world today and the availability of such is quickly rising. In many schoools, technology is becoming an important aspect of everyday life. Not only does technology enable students to keep up with classwork outside of school and on days they do not attend but it also allows for more flexibility. If the technology that students use everyday had the ability to determine how they felt about certain lessons, then not only would it benefit them but it would benefit teachers as well.

Technology that can determine someones emotions was once thought to be a thing of the future but now that future is here. Professor Thomas Huang has been able to create a computer algorithm that determines human emotions by scanning their facial expressions. Imagine the possibilities with such software!! The most benefical area in which the computer algorithm could be used in is schools. '""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""' (Huang, Parahgraph 6) Not only would teachers be alerted when students were becoming distracted from their teachings, but they would also be offered suggestions on how to improve the lessons. Software such as the type that Dr. Huang has created could improve test scores across the nation and ease the workload of thousands of teachers. Why not use it?

Hence forth, technology that determines human emotions would be largely beneficial and effective for a large portion of the worlds population. Schools would experiance the most postive results from the software seeing as it would be able to adjust lessons to fit students learning curve and it would also reduce teachers workloads by creating lessons to fit students needs. The only negative aspect of Dr. Huangs software would be the cost of installation, but with the positive outcomes that would follow, whatever cost paid would be well worth it.

5C67700D3DF9,"I'll be talking about why it is valuable in a classroom full of students, and how it could help so many students. There are so many was he try to figure out what a person is feeling just by look when we don't want to invade but still be there. Many students sit in a classroom and don't have a clue what another person is feeling or if they should be there for them it would help them be a better person. Schools will gain so much from this new technology , and this is what i'll be addressing im this essay.

The first thing I'd like to address is the helping students to students it would be a great way to make everyone feel welcome when they're nervous. A lot of schools tend to tell students who struggle with something to talk to someone at school likes friends, teachers, and parents sometimes you can't do that with this friends would talk to you about it. This technology would help prevent so many things wrong with schools.

My main reason thinking this technology would be great is all the ways it could help teachers in the classroom for the students. One of the many ways I see this working is working on a new subject , and after working on it a teacher would see or ask how the students feel as they scan everyone's face to see how okay everyone is on the subject. In the passage it states that we could reveal so much about the science of emotions, and what better way to do that then to at school where kids, teens, amd soon to be adults are full of emotions one day to the next. Putting on a happy face according to the passage makes you feel slightly happy , and students will one hundred percent put on a happy face when they're getting a face scan just because it seems so natural to smile at pictures making the student happier.

As kids in school get older they will be getting to the age where soon they'll be able to vote it would be helpful to see how students feel about voting. Seeing which politician gets more approval helps see what needs to change in governments, and in politicians. Like stated in paragraph 8 in then passage muscles can detemine if a politician is lying or just trying to win votes compared to people who are actaually trying to make a difference. This technology help future law in forcement tell if a person is guilty or innocent, and that would be incredible for students to learn how to use this technology. For the future of any government I think this would be a great idea so how our growing youth how to use.

In conclusion having this would be great for helping students learn more about why we act a certain way when we feel an emotion. This would be great for teachers who need to know if students need more time working on a topic. Last but not least it would help students understand a lot more about our politicians , and how they say certain things for the vote. ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

The article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" by Nick D'Alto, introduces the idea of being able to decode human emotions to help students. A software that understands students' emotions is an undoubtedly valuable technology. Students around the world would be helped in a new and improved manner if they used this innovation. Technology used to read emotional expressions would be very helpful in classrooms because it would help students progressively learn.

A piece of technology that detects students' emotions would assist students and teachers in and out of the classroom. Every student learns at a different pace. However, a certain software, created by Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute of Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, would make each student grasp the material at his or her own speed. In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" Nick D'Alto writes, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a students is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.''' The previous quote demonstrates that the computer software would help students learn in an adjustable manner. After the students' emotions towards the assignments are detected, the assigment would be modified to help the student progress with their understanding of the subject.

In fact, the computer software would not only help students while in class, but it would also help students afterschool. For example, the software would allow students to complete and understand computer homework. This would help the student learn even when a teacher is not with them. Furthermore, teachers' jobs would be made easier. Even if students have further questions, they would always be able to go to their teachers.

Lastly, a software that reads people's emotions would be an extremely valuable tool for students and teachers in classrooms. It would allow students to learn at their own pace and way. In addition, they would be provided with additional school help. In fact, their teacher's would benefit from this because they would get help teaching.

I am for the value of using techology to read student's emotional expressions because teachers need to know what bores them or what excites them.

When I first began to read this, I thought how can technology read our emotions? Then it states in paragraph 3 that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face. With all 44 major muscles in the model that must move like human muscles. This computer can identify 6 basic emotion: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. With that type of skill, teachers can know what students like and don't like.

Students get easily bored when it comes to school. When they come into the classroom, they don't want to do the homework or the classwork that was given to them. They want something that will entertain them and help them learn at the same time. With this new technology, student's facial expression will be identified when they like or don't like something. Teachers then can change the way the lesson is taught without changing the lesson at all as told in paragraph 6.

So if classrooms had this tecnology it would be slightly better for students to learn without being bored or confused.

Some people cant acually tell how other emotion's are they might be having trouble for instance in the text it states ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. of course most of us would have trouble accually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" This tell's you how some people have trouble figuring out a person trait and its not easy for many people to tell how your feeling. so its hard for a teacher to know how a class full of student's are feeling about each topic bacause some might not want to tell that they dont understand something or get the topic beacause many people don't like to express there emotion's.

Also the device and let know if your really ""engaed"" like a real smile if it really real or it's fake.

In some classroom computers you could put these Facial Action Coding Systems and it could potnetialy help students but changing up a lesson if it is confusng or irritateing you. Others though may think that the system would be of no help and think that students may still struggle.

Therefor if the system was added to computers it could help students learn better by changing lessons if it is confusing. The computer could regonize if you are having a hard time and then the computer could change the lesson up by making it easier to understnad. Also the computer could regonize if you are bored or not and if it sinced boredom it could change the lesson by making it more exciting to learn. The computers with Facial Action Coding Systems may be of use to students and teachers because it may help teacher to know what they need to help students with, but also it could help the studetns by making the lessons they do easier and funner to learn and understand. Last the Facial Action Coding System may be useful in all classroom settings because it could be of some use to help students get better grades overall.

In addition to that it could help students that struggle to stay focused with certain things. It could help the students by making lessons that are more eye fetching making them try and stay focused. Also the computer could change the lesson by giving them something interesting to learn about instead of just giving them a lesson that may be causing them to not stay focused. Although the FACS may not always be able to please everyone it can try to do its best at providing the best lessons to each indiviual student.

The FACS may be able to provide the best type of lesson to the student that is sitting at the computer. The FACS may be the thing that could change everything. It could help students understand and pass lessons that they may have been previosuly struggleing with. It could give students the second chance they need bacause maybe they have to repeat something because they didn't pass, but if the FACS change the lesson t obe modified to there personal lesson that it could change the way they learn by helping them pass. All together th FACS would be a good choice to put into computers that are in a classroom.

FACS would be amazing for studetns that struggle with a lot of different things. They could work at their own pace so that they could understand better and so that maybe the FACS could change the lesson to make it understandable and easy to learn. It could help students pass there lessons and exams by helping them learn the material better.

I am sure others would feel unconfertable knwoing that other people around know how you feel all the time.

In some ideas I agree with the article is when in the article it said ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" I agree on that statement; to use this new technology for educational purposes as long as no student or teacher abusses it to know what are others feeling about you or something else. It also a good idea to use it when someoone is really depressed about something and if you feel something is gonna happen to the person and you can tell an adult to help with the problem. Is not right for someone else to know your feelings, people have no right to know what someone else is feeling because people can take advangen of someones feelings and use it agaisnt them and can hurt someone for ever and maybe it can affect someone's life in the future.

At the end people still have no business to mess or know how someone feels becuase that's the other person personal feeling but at some point the Facial Action Coding System can be useful in school because it can detect if someone is confused or having trouble understanding the assignment or chapter their going through. The article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile "" has a lot bad points but in some statements they were right.   ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

Dr. Huang has came up with a technology that helps read people's emotions by looking at their face. Using this technology in the classroom can really help students pay attention more, help them understand, and make the students have more fun in class. This technolgy would be valuable in the classroom.

Almost every student will get bored in class atleast once in their school career, and sometimes it is hard for teachers to know if their students are getting bored and not paying attention. Most schools today have computers or laptops, by using Dr. Huang's technology the teacher can use the technology to see if their students are paying attention. If the results come back good then the teacher can move on, if not the teacher might want to go back and make the lesson more fun.

School can be hard sometimes and might be hard for students to understand what the teacher is talking about. Using the technology teachers can have their students hop on a computer or laptop and see if they are understanding the lesson. Some students learn quicker than others so this would be a good way for teacher can see where all their students are at.

This technology could make school more fun. Students do not want to listen to their teacher talk all the time. So they can use this technology to help them in school. The technology can see if the student is confused, getting bored, or understanding the topic. If the student is confused the computer can make the lesson more easier, or if they are understanding it they can make the lesson more challenging. This could help students have more fun class too because they can use technology and using technology is always fun.

Dr. Huage's technology could really help students and teachers. The students would not be as bored and understand what the teacher is teaching. This could also help the teacher on how they need to teach the lesson. This technology would be valuable in the classroom.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

If there could be something that helps us better the next generation, why deny that? Why push away something that is only bettering the world?

In the clsssroom a simple tacher can't determine when every single student is confused or getting bored besides the simple fact of asking them. Even then, the students will deny they are confused in fear of fellow students picking on them. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" The Facial Action Coding can save the teacher time in trying to figure out who is bored and who is confused, in the end helping out both the student and the teacher.

This technology can be useful in any situation. People don't always share their emotion out loud. We are forced to see how people are feeling simply by their facial expressions, which is sometimes hard to read. Often times people will hide thier emotons by forcing an opposite facial expression for the pleasure of someone else. Wouldn't it just be eaiser to have something that did it for you? "" Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried. ect."" People are forced to read others emotion by their facial expressions which is one of the hardest things to do.

This technology can help so many things in more ways than one. With this technology there could be more realistic virtual things. ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery."" With the Facial Action Coding we are only making the world better, it isn't doing any harm so why not use it? The main goal of every school is to make sure that every student has a safe learning enviornment and to make sure that they have the best resources to help them become the next president or the next surgeon isn't it? This is the best resource so why keep it from them?

7AA2C0834BE1,"Many students will benefit from this software if it can truly sense emotions.

If the software is truly like it suggests, students in the classroom could improve grades significantly.

If students grades improve, their moral would improve, their stress levels would decrease dramatically, and they would have a better learning experience because of personalized lessons.

This software could be a major benificial tool in future schools.

If the software can automatically improve the learning experience of students it would be for the better all of the way around.

The aritcle provides a quote from Dr. Huang that states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

It seems like the software in schools would not abolish teachers, but merely help them with a students learning experience.

Each student learns in a different way, and the software is intended to fix that problem in schools.

Therefore diminishing confusion and improving grades, and in conclusion, improving the moral of students.

With grades improving, students would be able to focus more quickly and more often.

It would also provide a sense of comfort and provide a significant decrease in stress.

As long as personalized lessons are in place, students would become more comfortable with the topics that they are learning and that ultimately improves test scores which goes back into improving moral.

With the Facial Action Coding System in effect, students would have an overall better learning experience.

Students that are able to learn and understand the material tend to do better on tests.

If the software is in place, it will change the learning experience to that particular person so they are able to understand that particular topic, which causes better test scores, which causes a moral boost, and decreases stress levels.

If the Facial Action Coding System is placed in full effect in schools everywhere, students would improve their grades dramatically purely on the foundation of personalized lessons.

If students grades improve, they will see an improvement in their moral, as well as having decreased stress levels, and most importantly have a better learning experience.

CFC1F5729C6D,"I am with the idea of the FACS becaues it seems vary interesting. The idea of a machine that can read emotions is cool. Though can be a little scary that commputer can tell if your happy or sad. But the idea is still cool to think about. I would like to see if they can even get the FACS to work on animals in the furture.

A reasion this could be a good idea is becaues you be able to tell if some one is lying to you. Like if there is a bad persion in court and you wont to know if there lying to your face you just look at the machine and it would tell you. Though some people would like to keep some things a scorit you be able to tell is there lying to you and if there sad as well then you know its a secorit. Many people would be saved and devastated by this machine.

My second reasion for going with the FACS is becaues it may be able to uncover crimes like if the dead persion was sad or happy when they die. Some family members may want to know that but will never know if they don't have the FACS. The FACS seem to be good on paintings so I was thinking that it may work on a dead body. Becaues if it works on Mona Lisa, then it should work on anything that dont use muscle ever or in the past like a dead body.

My therd reasion is if you make it be useable on animals then we can uncover a lot of mysteryes. Like if you wanted to know how your dog or cat felt about you all you had to do was turn on the FACS and see. We could also see if lions kill becaues there mean or becaues they dont know what eals to do. Many things could be uncover thnks to FACS.

Thess are my reasions for choosinf the FACS becaues it can help humans in many ways. We could be one step closer to uncovering mystoryes. I like the idea but many people may dissagree becaues they might say that they want to keep things scroit.

Teachers would actually know why there student is quiet or why they're not doing anything in class. My evidence is that "" by weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci"" masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotions). if you're really close with a friend or family member you'll know if their upset or not.

You see them everyday you already know how they are. The Facial Action Coding System would just study your face and tell you how you are. Whoever came up with that software and the emotional expressions came out wrong. Then, people wouldn't trust it anymore. When you smile and your cheek bones raise then that a real smile and a showing all your teeth.

Sometimes, when someone is really upset or don't want to be rude they can fake a smile that looks so realist. The software update also could follow is the student is bored or not knowing what to do.

To start, it can help you have more fun by learning because it can detect your emotions and change up the lessons. In paragraph six, it says, ""...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Its saying it can be aware of how you are feeling about the lesson. Weither your bored, cunfused, etc. It can make it less confusing for you, and make it a little bit more enjoyable and easier for you to learn. Also, in the same paragraph it says, ""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" By either smiling or frowning it can go on the the next thing or ad that you would most likely enjoy. It can make waiting for what you are waiting for more enjoyable so you don't sit in boredom. For example, while waiting for an ad on youtube or any video you are watching that wont let you skip,or any game. It can detect your emotion and go on to a diferent ad the next time. That can make watching or seeing ads more fun then the last ad that had. Next, It can help you be aware of how you are feeling either happy or sad. In paragraph four it says, ""Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression, using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements"" By them tracking your movements, it can help not only them notice you are sad, happy, bored, or any of emotion you are feeling. It can also attract your attention too and helping you realize it. Your mouth is stretched sideways and uses the ""Zygomatic major"" while you fake a smile. If you pay attention, you can tell if you or others around you are smiling like that. It can help you be aware if they are faking their smile and happiness. It can also teach you a little bit of science, and you wouldn't know. Dr. Huang talks about about how the process begins, and how many muscles you have. The System can teach you how about all the emotions we have also.

By using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks the facial movements in either or real face or painted picture of Mona Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions, each expression is compared against a neutral face. In fact, Dr. Huang said that we humans perform the same impressive calculation everyday, like for instance, me going to one of my close friends and seeing them frowning I will assume that they're upset about something.

I would have to disagree with what the article is saying. Ok i get that technology is everything nowadays but this is a little to far. You might program it to have emotions,but its hard for the software to know what the person is feeling and understand how they feel. Its easy for a person to connect with another person because thats how they feel. Humans can usually give one another help and advice because they most likely have been through it themselves.

Its easy for a person to help and understand it because they understand the emotion that is happening to them. But when you just program something to have emotions its not the same. These people are writing emotional things and want people who understand that. It is very hard for a piece of software to understand that. If I had to write something very personal i would want someone who can relate to read it.

But it could be a good thing for the school because it could help the school know if the kid was upset or bad. The school could help the kid and figure out whats wrong. In paragraph 9 they gave you examples on good ways to tell if someone means the smile on there face. It has some pros but there are alot ot cons to it.

This article has alot of good points in it but I still dont agree with what it is saying. Science can be a good thing but I dont think science can be used and be helpful in this situation. Plus it uses the schools money and it can be used for better things. We can use our time and think of things and that would be useful.

In conclusion i think that this is useless. I totally disagree with what there saying and doing. Technology is soon going to be everything and we dont want that. Its like soon we are going to be run by robots. I just think we can use our time worrying about other things. I dont think this will help us at all in the future.

I think this could be used in a lot of mental and health situations if people are wanting help. This could help the doctor with these problems. But if they start using this in schools and things like that it might not work out as well. Thats just because some kids may not want that or parents.

I don't think this would be very helpful in a classroom. I don't see how it would work and help the school out or anyhing. Unless they are trying to track kids mental and emotional health. And this program is proabably a lot of money to have on computers. Some schools they can spend their money on better things for the kids of the school. Personal I just don't think it could help schools unless they have the program and are using this program for learning perposes.

Yes some schools and collages will use this for learning topics and other things for the kids to learn off of. But other than schools then school the only people I could see having this is like doctors or hospitals. It would be cool in the future if this could turn into a thing for animals and we could see their emotional and mental health. We would be able to see what like dogs or cats are thiking if they are happy or sad.

But this could be bigger in the near future and maybe could help a lot of people. I just don't see how it could help with anything that much. But everything usally has a reason why it's made and it will be used by some people with certain jobs with stuff like this. The big thing on it is it really could help with people that have emotional problems or i guess mental problems too. Or if someone is depressed real bad or something like that.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

Imagine you are sitting in history class, and all of a sudden you start to fall asleep. You start to nod off because you are learning boring old history, when all of a sudden the lesson changes its tone to be more interesting. In return you do not fall asleep, and you learn plenty of new information. This technology is called Facial Action Coding System, and it should be used in the classroom. If this technology is used it will lead to less boredom, more engagment, and a general improvment in the school's atmosphere.

Firstly, this technology can be used to make school less boring. With this technology installed it would be able to detect when you are bored, and be able to change the lesson in order to make it less boring. This can lead to more learning being accomplished, because teachers would not have to spend time reteaching a subject. History is not boring, and if a computer could make history appealing to students then it should be practiced. People who oppose this technology may say that it is not advanced enough to detect human emotions. In rebuttle, ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate."" (D'Alto)

Secondly, this technology can be used to increase the student's engagement in the school. If a student is excited to learn new information, then they are engaged. If students are activily engaged with their learning they will do better in school. With students preforming better in school it could lead to an improvement in life, and to the advancement of the human race. American schools are also lagging behind thier counterparts, and this increase in engagment would benifit the American Educational System.

Thirdly, this technology can be used to improve the general environment of the school. Everybody goes through rough patches in their life, and sometimes students want to talk to administrators. Even if a student talks to an adult, they do not always tell the truth. With Facial Action Coding System they will be able to tell if you a telling the truth. For example ""Meanwhile, muscles called oribicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is streched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" (D'Alto) This would enable the teachers to know what is going on, and be able to help you best.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System should be used in the classroom. The technology would lead to less boredom in school, more engagment in school, and an improvment in the school's atmosphere. All of these factors would not only improve schools in America, but schools throughout the world. Our world is constantly becoming more based on technology, and the children of the world are our future. Should we not teach them in the best way possible?

D28CDA8FABE9,"Would an ""Facial Action Coding System"" be useful in a classroom? No, I believe it would be too troublesome for just a classroom full of students trying to learn. For example, some students wouldn't want the sensor to scan their face for some stupid reason. I believe it could be put to better use.

Reson 1 on why I say no. The artical may state """"A classrom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"""", but that is about where the effectiveness of using this tech in classrooms stops.

Reason 2 on why I say no. This tech can be used in court or in buisneses. If someone is lying in court, we would know and could ask for the truth. With buisnes, you could tell if someone is impressed with your quota or idea then branch off from there.

Reason 3 on why I say no. This tech could even help with therapy. You might tell your theripist that you're better but sill need therapy. Theripist could even use this tech to help develop specialized lesons for certain people.

Reason 4 on why I say no. Who in thier right mind would want tech that would give them more ads? No one wants ads in the first place. If they do want to see an ad, then they can just go to an search engine and look up the ad on thier free time when they want to.

To sum up on what i think. I believe this tech would be so limited in the classroom that it would practically wasting money. It should go toward something that not knowing the correct emotion or state of mind could cost hundred or thousands of dollars. Or when you need the truth but no one will give in.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

He said that there is a computer that can analyis weather you are happy ,mad , or sad ,etc. and so the people that said she was smiling were right about the painting. scienetest have also called smiling 'zygomatic major'. but that not all in the text they said that this might be one of

Da Vici's new codes by using facial expression. even thought Mona Lisa doesn't have any eyebrows the computer was still able to analyis if she was happy. the computer he used for this is called an' emotion algorithms'. they have been trying to track down her emotions for centuies.

this evidence i got it from the article saying that thieir having technology where you can tell what people are feeling inside of them or if their mad at you or other stuff so its really cool that they invented this technology cause now people can see peoples emotions and we could never do that.

the whole point of this article is about inventing a technology where everyone can tell what your emotions are and what your body expresses those are your emotions and thats how people know what your are expressing.",1,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.0

""Leornardo Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscled precisely enough to convey specific emotions""

Another reason why the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable,because in the article it is stated that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Not only that but the technology could modify the lesson as if it was an human instructor. Another reason why this technology is effective in in the classroom is in the article ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive"".

The computer's also need to understand that most human non communication is non verbal there are muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus that makes crow's - feet around your eyes. But when you are not really smiling in a fake smile,the mouth is strecthed sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle,the risorius. These muscles clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity is fake smiling.

It is also proved that moving your facial muscled not only express emotions, but also may even help produce them Leonardo Da vinci's new software stores similar anatomical information as electronic codes.

Frontantalis pars lateralis musles raises your eyebrows when your surprised or shocked about anything while your orbicularis oris the muscles that around your mouth tightens your lips. With all that being said the technology in the classroom is very valuable because of all the things that it recognizes like confusion,boredom,sadness and even fear. Also this technology can even modifty lesson's as if it was an human instructor.                                                 ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

In the paragraph 3 it talks about what it is capible of in facial recognizion and how it could chage a lesson to better suit a student just by their facial expression.

Lets say your're talking to a friend of yours and they ask you what you think about their favorite song and you know its their favorite song, but you really don't like it all and you dont want to maybe hurt their feelings by saying what you really think, so you might say "" it's ok"" or ""not my style"".

ECFBEE2C79D7,"What if we always knew what everyone was feeling? It sounds like it would be great if we could always detect one another's facial expressions. However, every human being has a different individuality which sets them apart from everyone else. That individuality is what makes that person unique, and can effect the way that a technological device percieves them. Everyone thinks differently, learn in different ways, and expierence different things.

While it seems like reading the expressions of one another may be a good thing, you cannot depend on the technology when you do not even know how accurate the technology is. By the way that the technology is described, it seems that the process reads one's emotions based off 6 basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. However, humans feel much more than these 6 emotions. We can feel emotions such as confusion, passion, and boredom. If the technology is basing some one's emotions off those 6 universal emotions, the data cannot be completely accurate because those emotioins do not work together to create boredom or even confusion. The feeling of confusion is a comeplelty different emotion, it is not affected or made up of one's happiness or anger. A person cannot detect confusion simply from reading only 6 universal emotions.

""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'""(D'Alto). While that would be particularly useful in an academic field, it may not work as well as anticipated. Every human being is unique and different, so therefore, they can become confused for different reasons or get bored of different things. What one student may find boring, another may find quite interesting. If that lesson plan changes for the student who is becoming disegaged in the lesson, it will affect the other student who use to find the lesson interesting, it may cause that student to then become confused or disinterested. That is a flaw with technology, it cannot benefit everyone equally because every human being is uniquely different and can be affected in different ways.

Many tend to hide their true feelings simply because they do not want others to know their true emotions. To read students' emotions in that way is an invasion of one's privacy. When people are sad, they hide that feeling because they either do not want to think about what is making them sad, or becuase they do not want to make the people around them sad as well. Reading the facial expressions of people, especially those who conceal their emotions, is similar to reading one's thoughts, which invades their private thoughts and emotions. When some one is hiding their emotions, that is their private feeling and should not be shared nor invaded unless with permission granted by that person.

All-in-all, the technology cannot be proven to be accurate since it can only read 6 emotions and many people expirence a much more vast variety of emotions, than the simple 6 universal emotions. Including the fact that everyone is unique in the way that htye think and project emotions and thoughts differently. The technology also cannot change the plans for students effectively since a change for one student could harm another student academically. And finally, to read one's emotions, including the emotions that they conceal would be invading their privacy. People hide their emotions for a reason, and those emotions should be kept to them, they should not be read because they are considered one's personal thoughts.

These ads are to prompt customers into buying the latest devices such as the latest computer, mac pad, the IPHONE X, the smart phone that is as thin as a piece of paper, and the widest, flattest television screen. There is something that all of these devices do not have. Now a new system called the Facial Action Coding System is reaching the surface. This system allows computers to dictate how a person is feeling by just their facial expressions such as muscle placemnts in their face, the rise and fall of cheeks and under eyelids. So is this new system valuable, and can it be beneficial to our community?

This system is beneficial to our school communities. According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto its says "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Hauang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructure."" If computers were able to see how many kids were and were not ingaged in the activity that takes place on computers, then it would help the schools and the state to know what new things to try to keep kids ingaged so they can get the best possible education offered to them. This system is great for Istep test taking as well. Sometimes kids may fall asleep during testing or they may start too dose off and not be as consentrated as they should, and that could have a negative affect on their test. If the computer could read their emotions it would help us to know what the problem is and the reason why kids are losing focus and once we have confronted the problem we can then began the process of finding an affective solution.

This computer would be very beneficial in offices and in police stations. They could be used to help with criminal justice. A suspect can be told to tell their side of the story infront of a computer screen and the computer would be able to dictate that persons true emotions. This could make the officer, and investigaters job alot easier. They could be used in hospitals to keep an eye on how a paitent is feeling maybe after a recovery or when they are lying on their death bed. In the article it says "" They even can indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" So there is no faking of emotions out of a crime. Its also says "" In a false smile, the mouth is stretched sidways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."" There is no faking with that computer.

This new system has the ability to make our jobs alot easier. Nowadays people dont usually communicate face to face anymore. That means people dont usually express theirselves in person as much as they once did in earlier days when technology wasnt around. So this can be a way to still be able to know how someone is feeling, esspecially if they are less likely to tell how they are feeling when your right infront of them. This can be very effective with younger kids who may not know how to epress how they may be feeling in the right way, shape, or form. This new system gives us a new way to still connect with our community. This new system is a pathway to a brighter future. This new system is valuable to our community.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

99297BB401FC,"Often times within a classroom setting, it is easy to become bored or confused. One second of being off track can lead to being completely lost for an entire 90 minute class. While most teachers do their best to keep students engaged and learning, often times it can be impossible to keep tabs on the emotions of 25 people at once. However, Facial Action Coding System can track the emotions of all students. Introducing the Facial Action Coding System would be incredibly helpful within a classroom setting.

The Facial Action Coding System would be able to ""recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". This skill would be incredibly useful, as sometimes it can be hard to pick up on exactly what someone is feeling within an efficient time frame. Sometimes while teaching, it is difficult to focus on students emotions and the lesson all at the same time. However, the Facial Action Coding System would take over the task of recognizing emotion, thus allowing the teacher to focus on the lesson at hand. According to Dr. Huang, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". Being able to see all of these nonverbal queues would help teachers to see the level of engagement that each of their lessons creates, as well as help students that aren't engaged.

The Facial Action Coding System would additionally allow for the computer to ""modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This modification would allow for students who are bored and not engaged to better understand the lesson at hand. This would likely increase the learning that occurs within the classroom, as more students would have access to a lesson that made sense to them. Additionally, this eliminates the guess work of a teacher trying to come up with an effective lesson. The computer can do it for them. Thus, time can be used more efficiently when teaching students.

The Facial Action Coding System would also give a practical application for anatomy and coding within the classroom. This application uses a ""3-D computer model of the face"", which must contain ""all 44 major muscle groups"". Some complex subjects taught within schools are often seen to have no practical application. However, the implementation of the Facial Action Coding System would show students that the complex skills of coding and anatomy can come together to form something that they see everyday. The use of such an interesting implement as the scanning can help students to develop newfound interests within these fields. This can serve as an excellent teaching point for students looking into the fields of anatomy and coding.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would have significant benefits on both the faculty and students of a school. It would help to make the teacher's job easier and more effective while enabling the student to learn better. This system would create a lasting impact on the learning done by students.

body: so me personally think this would be some great technology to have in our schools espically for consoulers so say someone is really sad and depressed but they are to scared to open up about how they feel or whats going so you put the computer on there face and it shows they are depressed sad and scared well now you know how your student is feeling so then you cheer them up and work to make things better you dont know it but you just saved a life because who knows weather or not that student was about to comit suicide or say someone was threatned and they will not tell you that so they act like there fine but you put the computer on them and it shows that they are scared now you know they are scared and can try to work with them to open up, but from other people perspectives i can totally see how this is a total invading of privacy because we all have secrects and we dont want people knowing if were depressed or sad and alot of people dont like to communicate or open with anyone and also what if things get passed around about you being depressed the generatin today are bullys so i can see someone making fun of someone for being depressed.

conclusion: inconclusion i think it would be some great technology to have in our schools just think about how many lives we can change or how many lives we can save by just knowing how the person next to you is feeling it would save a lot of time trying to get the person to tell you whats wrong when you can just take a picture of there face so yes i do think it would be great because itll make life better, you would save more time, and you could change alot of lives and save alot of lives with this type of technology.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

In my opinion i think that they should use The Facial action coding system because you never know what someone is hidding or what they thing about the lesson in class or the work in a job. Also most of us will probably know how someone is feeling but some of us will not and that is were the Facial Action Coding system kickes in.

The most important thing about his machine is that there has been people that committed suicede and if the machine can detect what you feel i think that it can detect those people or kids and that way thier parents or teachers could know and stop it from happening and that machine can save a life or two. The machine can be also be used for police officers that need to slove a case or thing that someone is lying so they will just have to put the machine in thier face and ask questions and that will beb a win for th epolice officers. The article also said that the drawing of Mona Lisa was not only smilling she was also, ''9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, 83 percent happy and 2 percent angry''. So if that machine told them all those percents in just a smile that the painting did that is amazing.

The best way to put this is that anything is posiblie you just have to do it, Because in the article it says ''Moving you facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help prduce them put on a happy face.

First, to have this new technology in class is valuable. It's valuable because will be able to understand there student more and if they need help because with the new technology they will know that. If the students need help the computer acknowledge that the student is confused and teacher can go and help them even though they might say they dont need it the facial program will identitfy that they do. It is benefical to both teacher and student because they will be able to know if the person is down or sad depending on how their facial expression is and how they are in need of help of some sort.

Second, the way this new technology works is it uses the way your face is constructed. It using your cheek bones they way you smile and the way you get your wrinkles when you do. But it takes a few scientist to figure it out like Dr. Paul Eckman is the creator of FACS. He has classified the six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgusted, fear, and sadness. They all have very basic but common features but not a whole lot. For example, when youre mad your mouth shrinks and your face tightens up. Which is called your orbicularis oris around your mouth.

They said, her face was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, and 2 percent angry. I dont know they are to come up with these percentages.

I feel like this technology can come into good use, although, i just dont really see the importants of it. In cases like this one, with Mona Lisa, yes i feel as if it was a great thing, but i just dont see any other good uses for it. I would really like to find out another use for this technology to be able to think it is very useful.

I do think this technology is very interesting. I like how it broke up Mona Lisas face into three different emotions. I think that is very cool. I dont see any other use for the technology, but if it is just used for paintings, i think it could be kinda useful. I would like to see the technology in action more to see what all it can do. I want to see it figure out peoples emotions by the look on their face. I hope to see more of this technology in the future. I would also like to know who the inventors of this technology are. You would have to be very smart to be able to invent something like this.   ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
3442D7D6F267,"I believe this could be valuable in classrooms because now in days students use a lot of computers for work. The possiblities this could open up are huge, like making learning more fun for each student and making them enjoy learning. It could also take away advantages and give each student an equal oppertunity to learn and succed.

Lets face the fact, teachers can't make learning fun for every student. But this computer software can. It can use the information about whether your bored or not as stated in the article ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This could adjust to a students particuler need and make learning more effective and fun for students. By molding to each students particuler way of learning and interests, it could make learning easy.

How this could make learning more fun exactly is it can read your emotion and change how it approaches teaching you, untill it finds your not as confused or bored as stated in the article ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" Eventually it could make it to where each student is enjoying how it is teaching them and they can become more interested and interactive with there learning and studing. If every student had this they could all enjoy learning and studing and it could give each student equal oppertunities to learn and be as smart as possible, one day maybe ending people not graduating.

In conclusion if we had this in school today we would see a giant difference in the amount of students at school and the test scores would blow our current scores out of the water. Why, simply because it would make learning fun for every student not just a handfull, it could make things fair for each student and making learning less a chore rather a hobby.

A9D0965F0ABC,i personally don't think its a bad idea or invention in my opinion i think its worth putting to the test. and for students to write down how they feel and then try out the coding system and see if its even a bit accurate on how they're feeling or if it doesn't work and just coming up with random answer on how you are feeling. in my opinion i think it would be kind of good to put to the test in classrooms if it is accurate and does seem to work to scan students feelings in the mornig and afternoon and try to help the ones that are down and all that. so i think it would also be helpful in other places as well if it does end up working and be useful to doctors and what not. so i think it would be a good thing to use in classrooms and put to the test first before putting it in classrooms. so these are my thoughts on whether the use of this invention to read students facial exprssions and feelings is valuable or not. and according to the article they do claim for it to work and that it is accurate but you can't beleive everything just cause someone says it does cuse personally some people will try to persuade people that it work ton get there inventions out there and make money off it.,2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
D051F76D144A,"In this article ""making Mona Lisa Smile"", it talks about a computer technology that can tell your emotions. Having a computer be able to tell your emotions would be pretty interesting right? Or would it just be creepy? If we fully develop computer programs that can tell our emotions and make something interesting based on our emotions like it states in paragraph 6. If the lesson we are learning in school changed based on our emotions do you think students would learn more? I do.

If we had lessons in school based on our emotions and how we felt about the subject; the computer could reconize if we were into the lesson or not. If we could have this technology and our lessons changed in a way that could make students want to learn a subject that on a daily basis made them want to fall asleep in the class or they just could not find a way to get themselves interested, the computer could change that for them. This technology could be very useful for our upcoming generations. People already know that we are slowly going to become more of a digital world so if we had these programs set up for kids to go their own pace and learn things that intrest them we could have shorter school days and more time for children to be kids and have fun in their life.

There is a large population of students who choose not to come to school every day because school makes them unhappy or they just hate some of their classes because they know the job they want when they are older not everything they are learning is going to be needed in the outside world. If this technology could help us show what emotions we had towards different subjects then maybe it would help teachers understand how to teach their students the information in a way it wont go in one ear and out the other.

There are going to be people who disagree with this new technology becoming part of life, because they might not want the technology we have now. There will always be someone who is not happy with the way life around them is going because of technology and sometimes technology does fail us. Technology can shut down. Technology can make things we have worked hard for disappear in one second and we won't have all of our hard work anymore so what was once hard work in a second can become wasteful material.

Although there are people who are going to disagree with this technology and maybe spread rumors that it is faulty, we need this technology to help us better understand the world around us. Say a cop was trying to figure out a murder or suicide, if we had the technology to figure out what emotions they show it could tell us if they were murdered or if they commited suicide. This technology could really help us advance in life and learn how to understand things from new perspective.

This technology could be believed to improve our society and the way we learn, the way we educate our children, and the way we have an output on life itself. This technology could be a new meaning for life. It could make students learn to lie school. It could help us understand what is going on in someones life. It could maybe even help us solve crimes. Of course there is going to be people who will fight against this new technology but if we stick to it one day the technology can help us understand why these people are against it.

EB09B371F52B,"There are many ways for a human being to convey an emotion with a facial expression. Someone can indicate happiness by smiling, sadness by frowning, or, confusion by furrowing their eyebrows. Each facial expression signifies someone's emotions or thoughts to others. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a new technology that allows computers to recognize and identify human emotions. Although the FACS is a creative and unique way of identifying human emotions, using the FACS to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.

The main reason why using the FACS to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable is because of the importance of expressing human emotions to others. In a world full of new technology that is constantly being improved, it is appealing for people to try out new gadgets and devices. However, as people are connecting with technology instead of connecting with other human beings face to face, the social aspect of humans is failing. In Nik D'Alto's article about the FACS, he excitedly asks readers the question, ""Hold on! Can we actually 'calculate' emotions - like math homework?"" The FACS's goal is to ""'calculate' emotions - like math homework."" The FACS denies students the chance to feel empathy for others. If students are constantly concerning themselves with what the computer ""calculate[d]"" their emotions to be, then students feel like they can only express themselves through technology. As a result, no human connection is made when students are having a conversation face to face. Emotions are meant to be shared and expressed freely so that friendly relationships can be made; they are not meant to be solved like ""math homewrk"" in a classroom. The FACS takes away the human and social connection between students, which is extremely important for students to build healthy relationships and make smart decisions.

Although the FACS is a creative and unique way of reading human emotions, it is not valuable for students to use it in a classroom. The new software would cause a lack of empahty for others, confusion about how students should express their emotions, and poor social interactions between students. Many new inventions of quicker and higher-quality technology is exciting to test out at first. However, placing the FACS in classrooms causes students to conform to ideas that cause their emotions to not be expressed healthily to others. Students would begin to find it normal to share their emotions with a computer screen rather than the student sitting right next to them.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
639CAA6473D7,"I am for the use of this technology becaus it would help kids who are confused in a way that they don't know what to do on the assignment or how to begin working. This technology will put the words in a different way for the student to learn the material after the computer learns their emotion and know what to do about it.

When adults or young teens plan on getting jobs that envolve on sitting at a dest they might get frustrated and don't know what to do and the computer would be able to detect thier emotions and take a different approach and help you undertsand the work faster. By getting work faster this will emprove the work production and people wouldn't have to stay for late hours to get work done.

This will help computers understand the different emotions that are going through people and the computer will react to it pretty quickly. I think this will be very helpful in the future to child to adults. While the computer still learns different emotions they will help people around the world and education will be a higher percentage of students will go to college and stay in school because of this technology.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
5FB75CCB31F8,"When it comes to having a computer program to help the teachers know what is going on with the class it should be used. If the program can tell how every kid is doing during class they should be using it. This technology can help with keeping the kids concentrated and help them learn better. If they can tell how the kids feel about a certain subject it can help teachers know that they should stop teaching it and teach another or that they like that subject. IT could also tell the teacher if the kid is struggling with the homework it can tell the teacher to help the kid out. Especially for the little kids who are to scared to ask questions or even middle or high schooler.

Another thing the Facial Action Coding System could really help with an issue like suicide. If these programs are telling us that there sad we can ask them if there's anything wrong and if they need to talk to anyone. These outputs of how they feel can help the world especially if it can help catch suicides from happening. These programs could also help teach how a certain test or classes make them feel.

My only problems is time. If the programs take an hour or more plus time you can't really act on the problem imediatly. Also the way that people feel changes so fast that if you do ask how they feel they could be just fine by then. Also another problem i could see is can it take one face or a whole class room of faces. If it can take a whole classroom and spit out how each individual felt at that exact moment then we should us them in classes.

If they can not do these things they should be worked on till they can do those two things. These facial action coding system should be improved so that it can fo those two things and be put in all schools as soon as possible. This device can change teaching for good and also save lives in the process.    ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
6169A3C5E137,"This technology is very valuable to the class room. This program can change the way teachers aproch teaching. This program can help teachers to determain if a student is ready to move on to a higher level of learning. The FACS enables us to open a window into a new classroom.

This computer has the capability to read a persons emotions in real time. So in the middle of class most of the students get bord. This program can notify the teacher so he or she can change up the lesson plan for the next day. The program can also read confusion. One of the biggest worries of the teacher is that the student is just not getting it. The program can show that this spacific student is not getting the asignment or the task. Then the teacher can sit down with that student and celarify there confution.

The FACS can identify the diffrence between a genuine smile and a forced smile. Say a teacher is reavaluating there leson plan and wants to know what the students are acutally finding interesting or liking. This program can read the indavidule mucles in the face. The teacher can see if a student is lieing or not by using the program. Useing the program to tell if a student is lieing or not can not only save the child from harming him self but also keep him from harming others.

FACS can read six basic emotions. The ability to read these emotions are endless. This program reads the muslces of the face to find the emotion that is being protraed by the student. The code rcognises the facial muscles movements and asigns emotions to those jesturs. Knowing that the program can detect the smallest expretions can help a teacher identify wheather or not a student is ready to move on to the next level of learning or are they not ready for the next level. Being able to tell if a student is ready can alow the teacher to help them on the next step of the journy.

The FACS program has opened a window to the posobilities of a whole new way of learning. Its ability to read confusion and bordum can help better understand what the student is thinking. The ability to determin the difrence of a genuine and fake smile can keeo kids away from bad behavior. This program can not only change the schools but make them benifical to everyone.

One way it could be used,asi said n the intro, is in legal debates. In the artical, it states that the software can detect if the face you make is forced or an actual smile/frown. This means we can see if a politician is lying about his/her claims during a debate. Not only that, but the software also comes up with a percentage of each emotion on one expresion.

A68B13F7EB65,"The use of the technology called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is valuable in the classroom. It can make the teaching less stressful and more fun. The teacher can know exactly how the student is feeling and how they can change the lesson up.

With the new technology that Dr. Huang and Dr. Paul Eckman are developing, you can tell how your friend in schools are feeling. In the article, they said, ""you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" The technology can give you way more details that just saying ""mad"", ""happy"", or ""sad"".

Another reason why the technology will be good in school is because the students can also tell how the teacher is feeling towards them or the lesson. The student will be able to tell if the teacher is bored or having fun, when they're not showing it. For example, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, inlcuding emotional communication."" Sometimes the teacher doesn't verbally say how thye are feeling.

If the new technology does big in school, they might just sell them in the stores for families at home. Families need to always know how each other is feeling. As the kids get older their emotions change and sometimes get better or worse. The author said, ""your frontails pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyeborws when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" Kids at home do that all the time to show how they are feeling.

558BB83BB400,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" by Nick D'Alto, the author explains a new technology named the Facial Action Coding System which allows computers to identify emotions.

D'Alto uses credible evidence to prove the idea that this new technology is effective and valuable for students.

First, the author introduces the Facial Action Coding System and explains how it works.

D'alto talks about how the computer conducts a 3-D computer model of the human face, including all 44 of the major muscles in the human face.

It recognizes the six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness, and coordinates these emotions to the person's facial muscles.

The creator of FACS, who is a psychologist, further explains in detail how these specific different face muscles work.

""Your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprises.""

This quote supports the claim that this new technology is effective by exhibiting how the creator researched all of the human facial muscles.

Next, the author proceeds to talk about how humans perform the same ""calculation"" in day to day life.

By putting it into every day life, this makes the technology seem less far fetched.

""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face... artists such as Da Vinci studied human anatomy... and his new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.""

This quote expertly supports the claim that FACS is an effective tecnhology by bringing it to the everyday life scale, and using credible evidence to show the efficiency of the anatomical information the computer stores.

Moving forward, now that it has been established that this new technology is effective, the next question brought up is if it is valuable for students.

The author then explains how much value this technology can actually bring to students and how this new technology will be indubitably helpful to students in the classroom.

""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like a human instructor.""

This excerpt further proves the claim that FACS is valuable for students.

It brings the innovative idea forward and exhibits how it will be effectively used to help students customize their own learning experience.

The author expertly shows how the Facial Action Coding System could supercede the computers in today's society; it could very well be the future.

However, some people may read this article and see a few problems with it.

They may wonder how a computer can analyze everybody's facial expressions, if everybody's facial expressions are slightly different.

Fortunately, the creators have already thought of this problem, and conjured up a solution.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression.""

This quote refutes any ideas of doubt about this new technology, and instills faith in the readers that their technology will be valuable.

In conclusion, D'alto expertly uses many pieces of credible evidence to support the claim that FACS will be effective and valuable to students.                ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

What if your look is the opposite than what you are feeling or you, as in yourself dont feel anything?

The Facial Action Coding System can help identify the look you are given from another person. This technology wouldn't be like math homework, your science teacher grading your lab assignment, or a robot giving out data, it would be more like a clear resulting answer. It would not be a percentage, so that would help others who are younger and have yet learned about percentages.

The world would be controlled by a computer rather than humans. Computers can give out wrong data, for example, if you would determine to search something up for a project and it came up with different websites,(different websites can give different answers) like Wikipedia, it could give you a wrong answer and then you would ask your teacher or professor if your data seemed right he/she would be like "" This is not the right information"" then pulls out a book determining the answer to your question that gives the right information you need to complete your project. Anway, if technology starts controlling the world, who would control the technology? This will lead to another device and then another, then finally we would completely be controlled by technology/ electronics more than what the world is at the moment. the technology could have a malfunction and cause people to start worrying and frightened. sometimes your facial expression is different than what you are actually feeling.

It not only valuable to a modern day life, but it also could have many real-world and technilogical applications.

The FACS system is a new and valuable peice of technology that has many interesting and strong applications. Like it was said im the text, it could adjust an assignment for a student to make it more engaging for them. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.""

That would make teachers lifes easier, and have less annoyed and out of control students, because they would be doing an assignment they would want to do, and not be extremely bored throughout class. Another way this could be valuable is for when cops do lie detector test. They would be able to pick up movements in the face that could show them that they are lying, or not telling the whole story. There are also many real world applications for this technology out there.

The FACS made by Prof. Thomas Huang could have many real world applications that would make life easier or more fun for some people. One of the many real world applications for this system would be Police Videos. You would be able to see the emotions on the criminal's face while he was being recorded on video, helping the police aid in the investigation. Another brought up by the article could be politics. You would be able to see how the politician is feeling, or which emotions. You would also be able to tell if they are faking emotions they are emitting while they are giving a speech, or if they are outright lying to you. The article itself says ""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isnt being truthful."" (D'Alto). The final point I want to bring up is how this could be used for therapy or working through yout problems.

The FACS system could be a great peice of technolgy for therapists to use, working posple through their issues. People could tell how angry or depressed you were actually feeling. It would be a good way to work through the problems you have been facing, because people would know how you are feeling. The machine is able to sense the emotions you have been feeling, so people would be there to comfort you and work through your emotional turmoil.

I agree with this to have a machine that will tell your emotion this wouldnt just be helpful for students it would also be helpful for stuednts because if they have something wrong and they dont know what is they can just go to the machine they could just get there face examed and then they would have resluts. it would help counlsers alot to because not everyone can tell when someone is either mad or upset. Also it wouldn't just be helpful for schools it'd be helpful for police station so when they are questioning they can ditect if they are lying or not another thing is it wouldn't just be a small accomplishment to move on into the future life it'd be a goal for them to have multiple if these computures in places where they will need them at and places where others will use them for good. A bad thing about this computer would be for teachers if they were to upload a lesson to it and they were to have everything planned out they would either have to try to keep students on the same track as others and others for them to no get lost or confused with what they will be learning during there leasons when it detects on of them being bored. After all the reading i did think it'd be a good idea because it wouldn't just help one person it wouldnt help multible people who need counsling or for people who don't know how to feel or what to say.

02D6A23E0CEB,"I think that the new technology entitled "" Facial Action Coding system "" (FACS) is a very smart and effective method of reading how someone feels just by there aperance me personaly I think that I can hid my emotions very well and can put on a fake smile and carry on with my day but knowing that theres technology that can read my face and tell me that im upset or angry thats amazing. I think that the ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a brilliant idea.

I support the new tecnology because Dr. Paul Ekman has classified six basic emotions such as - happiness,anger,surprise,disgust,sadness, and fear - and then associated each emotion with different movements of the facial muscles or characteristics. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrow when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) thightens your lips to show anger. The fact that there is classification on these six emotions just add on to the fact that this tecnology can become the next big thiing in todays society.

""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" ;""even though individuals often show varrying degrees of expressions"" Quoted from section (4)

meaining that the smile isn't as broad as normal and the fact that there is video imagray based off of the ""Facial Action Coding System"" (FACS) by using different units and weighing them is amazing and how they can tell your expressions just by veiwing your face and comparing it to a nuetrual face that isn't showing any emotion meaning the face doesn't show -happiness, sadness, anger, surpise, fear, and discust. I beleive that the Facial Action Coding System is a very brilliant form of technology and should be used on painting for many years to come because being able to finally tell the ""Mona Lisa's"" expression or facial recognition is amazing I couldve never told you if that painting was happy sad and or even angry and having a system that can do so is brilliant and extreamly useful. These are some of the resons that I personaly believe this system is worth using because it helps better understand peoples and or paintings expressions or faces.

Which means it helps them com alive in the real world.

If your sad and was to put on a happy face it would probably help you get happy or to get a better attuide for the day. In this story it says a "" Drama couch, Constantin Stanislavsky, had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emothions on stage"" to better them when they had to come on stage infront of people to peform. The actors had to make it come real for people to enjoy it. He would also put them in other peoples life to see what there emotional state was and how they were feeling.

So yes, i think you should have this in the world to see what people are feeling around you . It can do what computers can do . Like if you were to smile at a ad they could bring it up to make you even more happy or to get you to buy something. If you were to frown you would get a ad to help you smile or to laught.

In fact, these emotional expression are seen in differnet forms for example, if your happy you smile, if your sad you dont smile. There are plenty of different way to show your emotionsand how your feel. There is value to how you feel, act in ways that people see in everyday life. The authrs describles how new technology enables to identify human emotion in life.

Human expression is how your show your emotions to your friends, family, teachers. People express their emotions in many ways. Here is an example, Mona Lisa she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry most of the time. that's how she expressed her emotions.

Dr. Huang did research on peoples emotions and how people showed their emtions in ways, that he did know how people expressed their emtions with how their face looked to see their emotions show. Dr. Huang looked at the painting of Mona Lisa that Da Vinci painted to show Mona Lisa's emotion in the painting to show, how she felt about being in the painting to express how Da Vinci and Mona Lisa both felt the paintg that both of them liked the painting. Da Vinci emotion to paint a picture of Mona Lisa he felt happy, but he also that she was happy about him painting a picture of her being happy, mad.

It describes Leonardo da Vinci's painting Mona Lisa as ""83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry.""

It says that ""Your regular home PC couldn't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile.""

19637A48A8CE,"With the new use of technology, the ability to read someones emotion by the simpliest look is within our grasp. The ability to read your emotion is easy as said done. Why not put something like this that can read out faces inside school. Traspass their privacy. Even so, during school it would not come in handy with any student anytime during the day. Being watched by a face recongnition in the home of many, is an event many would not agree with.

During the school year, for example, a high school. Where would a Facial Action Coding System fit into? This would not benifit our education other than waste it. The new technology being used on students to detect their emotions is a privacy violation. Students would not want their face being read and pictured by a new face detection. For example, in the story it says, ""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."" With this being said, this technology invades our space. Some students don't want their emotions being let out; they might want it to keep that private information to themselves, unless they realease it by themselves. This could happen to anyone, even without them realizing it. For example, sitting in the right position across from the Facial Action Coding System, the victims emotion may be violated without their concent. In the story it reads, ""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a smiliar ad might follow. But if ou frown, the next ad will be different."" This text shows a program reading your face in real time for all the time you are on your own laptop. Having your own computer reading your face every second while being in your own home would not be welcomed to many. It's a violation to privacy to use and our freedom.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System would not be of use for students. Our minds and face are focused in a different direction rather than facing this machine to read out emotions.

97099B90A50B,"The article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" by Nich D'Alto describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. I do think that the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of sudents in a classroom is valuable.

It explains in the text the software can tell you how happy, sad, angry, etc.. the person is. In paragraph one it states,""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This explains that this software can tell exactly how you are feeling. The program will first take a 3D model of your face and then examine the movements of each muscle in your face. The computer needs to examine the muscles in your face because the muslces of a real smile and a fake smile move differently. Dr. Huang states,""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" This means that when everyone is actually smiling and not faking it their muscles move the same way. This also means when a person is sad their muscles will move the same exact way of everyone else who is truly sad. I think the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valueable, becuase if that person is sad or depressed then we will know and we can help them get through whatever they are going through. Dr. Huang states, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This means that humans do not show thier emotions all the time, and computers have to understand that too. This means that humans can hide their emotions and when someone is smiling that does not always mean that they are nessasaraly happy, and when someone looks sad that does not mean that they are always sad. The computers have to understand more than the visual picture. The computer has to understand the muslce part of the face to examine if they are truly happy, sad, angry, etc.. An example of how this technology could benifit us in tremendous ways is if a student is in the classroom and they are very angry, we can talk to them or get them help so they will not hurt anyone or do something not appropriate. Another example on how the Facial Action Coding System could help schools out and benefit us is if someone is super depressed and they are planning on hurting themselves or hurting others around them then we will be able to notice that and try to find help. It will be safer for not just that person but everyone.

Reading this text and really thinking about everything and all the facts, I am for using this technology to read students' emotional expresssions. I do not think the Facial Action Coding System could hurt any school, I think it would benifit schools is various ways. ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

Profeser Nicu was from the University of Ansterdam. I'm against the vaule of using computer techonology to read students emotions.

One example that the authour gives is where the process begins. The text states"" the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D coumputer model of the face"". The FACS has classifies six basic emotions which are: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. These emotions are associted with the movement of the facial muscles

B36454F4433B,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea. It can have it's pros and cons but I think that the pros overdue the cons. Three reasons why I think it's a good idea is because it tells you how someone might be feeling, if they are lying about how they feel or not, and that if they don't want to tell you, you can figure it out.

First of all, do you ever wonder on how might one person might be feeling? I bet you have. using the Facial Action Coding System can help with that. It can be hard because if you really care about someone and you might wonder how they are feeling. You can ask but what if they don't want to talk about it because it makes them uncomfortable.

Second of all, what if you ask a friend on how they are feeling and they say they are fine, but clearly they are't. People can lie about how they are feeling. They might show something but deny they are feeling some type of way.

Lastly, what if they don't want to tell you but you really want to know so you can help. the system can help with that. It would be much easier because now you don't have to ask and make them feel moe of what they are feeling.

In conclusion, I think that the Facial Action Coding system is a really great idea. It would probably take a long time for mostly everyone to have that system.

it a waste of time because i think we could be able to do more thing then finding out people emoitions instead we could have be able to help out people with cte of any other major pshycologic disies instead its just focussing ono emotion and yes i understand emotions can help us diagnos people with those issues but all i hear i this passage is about emotions nothing else . this is also a huge waste of money,why the technology being used sound like its cost a bunch of money to produce.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
D6ADA6742294,"In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", I learned thet computers can now feel what emotions that you are feeling. This is a really cool thing cause now we can see and know when someone is actually happy or not. We could have so much more uses for this then trying to guess what emotions someone is feeling.

I think that this type of technology is actually very useful, my reasons for that come from the article when the author tells about how using a special camera can detect when someone is becoming bored when doing homeowrk or doing someother type of school work on the computer. If you can tell when comeone is confused or bored then you could really get some help or get a better, more fun filled math questions. Than would make students more productive and want to actually learn rather then when you are bored and doing ISTEP, they can make the test more exciting.

But there could also be some down fall to it. When a computer is watching your while your on it then that could be really weird feeling for some people. Also when a computer is seeing your facial expression all the time you could just be talking to someone and the computer would think your not getting what ever your doing so then it would have a tutor come up when you dont even need one.

So in my conclusion I think that these emotion reading computer cameras could not be so good but in other cases could be really handy or even in some events save you from getting a bad grade on a test.

9F5F25DE3726,"How many different emotions have you ever felt in your life? You cannot possibly know and remember every feeling you've ever had. Using the Facial Action Coding System is a great idea and an amazing thing that has been developed, however, there is no way it is accurate. The Facial Action Coding System is not accurate because everyone has different facial structures, this system could not possibly know the structure of everyones face, could not detect all emotions, and cannot tell an emotion by the way people look.

Though the face has the same muscles and bones in it, everyone has a different facial structure. Some peoples eyes are far apart, and some are closer together. Some people have more round faces, and others have more square shaped faces. The text states ""Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes. But in a fake smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius."", but some people may not get crow's-feet around thier eyes, and some peoples mouths may not stretch sideways like this. There are many other differences in peoples faceial structures, aside from these examples.

All people feel different emotions in their life. They can also feel multiple emotions at one time. Saying that a face coding system can detect all your emotions is absurd. People have been known to feel exitement, while feeling resentment, and all other combinations of emotions. Technology today doesn't have any way of recognizing all emotions of everyone. The passage says, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" It is not hard to guess that humans are capable of feeling more than just six emotions alone or at the same time. This would mean that the recognizing emotons part of this system is inaccurate.

Acting and looking different than how you feel is an excellent way to hide your emotions. People do this almost on a daily basis. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" Although this may be true some of the time, even smiling to hide a frown cannot always be dected by a friend. Unless clearly obvious, hiding emotions cannot easily be found. This adds to the previous reason of why the Facial Action Coding System would be inaccurate.

The Facial Action Coding System is not accurate because everyone has different facial structures, this system could not possibly know the structure of everyones face, could not detect all emotions, and cannot tell an emotion by the way people look.

Students tend to get bored and distracted while the teacher gives a lesson, this leads to the students not retaining the information that they are learning. The use of this emotion reconization technology could help ditect the boredom to where the teacher would be able to change up the lesson to further ingage the students. If the students are more ingaged in the lesson they are more likely to retain the information and score higher on their test.

High school is a rough time for students unfortunatly. During this time of their life they are going though a lot of changes and have a lot of emotions. Sometimes these emotions cause them to make some unhealthy life dissisions which could lead them down the wrong path. If teachers where able to reconize these emotions they could talk to these students because it isn´t always easy to reach out for help. This could help the students talk about what is bothering them and work though it.

4597FB4E692E,"Have you ever been faced with a boring computer assignment? Maybe you have dreaded coming to school or finishing your homework? As technology is advancing and more of the classroom is found through an electronic device, some students may find themselves losing interest in their daily lessons. What if this could be changed by a system that takes your facial expressions into account and accomodates to your mood? Right when the assignment has begun to lose your interest, this system could sense the change and alter the lesson plan to regain your interest. The Facial Action Coding System may be valuable and allow for improvement to be made within classrooms and within students.

Initially, as technology is advancing daily and students find themselves online more often, this system could improve their lessons. Electronics as of now are programmed to teach a student however are unable to sense how the student is feeling or how they are actually doing on their assignment. As the author states in the article, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" something which computers are unable to detect (para. 6). Not only this, but the author gives an analogy that states ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar ad might follow"" and explains that in a classroom, similar techniques can be applied to benefit the student (para. 6). Using this program will allow technology to advance and in turn will benefit the student.

By the same token, using this sort of technology in the classroom will keep a student engaged during their lessons. When Dr. Huang describes how this system can engage a student he states, ""[the computer] could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and further explains that ""[the system] could modify the lesson"" to acomidate to the students needs (para. 6). In a normal classroom, when the teachers method of teaching is confusing students, the teacher should find a different way of teaching to engage students. The author also explains how the system is able to read six different emotions and can ""identify mixed emotions"" to allow the system to see if their methods are benefitting the student (para. 4). This computer system would be valuable when keeping the students engaged.

Finally, this system may change the ways in which many students view school. It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a ""fake smile"" and that to them ""faces don't lie"" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them"" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things.

Consequently, this system would be valuable to classrooms and would allow for improvement to be made within schools and the students. Overall, it is evident that computers are unable to read emotions and reciprocate to the individual adequately. This system might prove to reengage students in their learning, and improve their moods altogether.

It says we can probably tell how our friend is feeling by the look on her/his face, but it is not always true. I think everybody had experience when she/he was smiling but she/he was sad inside.

D3411F624A4A,"In the article,""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick S'Alto, They've created a machine called the ""Facial Action Coding System"" that can sense human emotions by their facial expressions. The machine reads your face and uses muscles to sense what you are feeling. I am against the Facial Action System And I will tell you why.

In the article it says,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Kids might not be comfortale in a classrrom that has a machine that can identify their emotuons. That is very nerve-racking and would make it hard to focus and learn. Is students can't focus then this machine will not be helping.

The article also says,""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."" If we perform this everyday, why do we need another machine to do it? It is a reason that it is an emotion and Not actual words. Kids might not want anyone to know how they are feeling. This machine invades peoples privacy and should not be allowed.

In Conclusion, this machine has a lot of abilities that may be too advanced for us. Kids want their privacy this ""Facial Action Coding System"" Will effect it. This Machine will make then nervous instead of focused like they should be.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto goes into great depth about how a new computer system, Facial Action Coding Sytem, can revolutionize multiple industries. He began to describe the famous Mona Lisa drawing and how they were able to calculate her facial expressions with the new facial recognition system. He then broadens the topic by explaining how the computer system actually works. After going into even greater detail about the computer process, he begins to describe the many benefits that the Facial Action Coding System will bring. After reading this article, one can agree that the Facial Action Coding System should be implemented into classrooms to read student's emotional expressions for various reasons.

First of all, the use of Facial Action Coding System could enhance the education levels being taught in classrooms by individually designing lessons for students. At one point in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Prof. Thomas Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto 6). By modifying the lesson to the students' needs, this can improve testing scores in classrooms, ensuring that most students will easily learn more based on their facial expressions.

Secondly, the Facial Action Coding System can help with discipline areas among schools. In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Prof. Thomas Huang explains how muscles contribute to a large portion of reading facial expressions. At one point he claims, ""To an expert, faces dont lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity aren't being truthful"" (D'Alto, 8). By pointing the idea out of spotting false facial expressions, the Facial Action Coding System can be used in schools and other places to help detect people who may be lying or trying to hide the truth. Instead of adults trying to pry kids open and ""spill the beans"", they can simply use the computer system to recognize certain facial expressions and then start from there.

Overall, there are many benefits to the Facial Action Coding System, and although some may be more beneficial than others, they each take part in bettering academics and schools in general. By personalizing lessons and helping with disciplinary actions, schools can loosen their grips from a tight load of work on their shoulders and allow the Facial Action Coding System to ""lend a hand"". One can really see how incorporating this system will not only benefit the staff and faculty of schools, but also the many children striving for excellence in academics and character.

2A1B01D05CE7,"Facial Action Coding Systems can tell alot about a person, even when a person techniacally doesn't speak a word. I do belive having these types of computers in a classroom is valuable. Having this in a class room also means you might not even need a teacher anymore, maybe just an instructor. Reasons why I believe this is a valuable is because technology is advancing, students faces don't lie, and this later on can lead to further inventions. Now, im going to say why I believe in these reasons.

First, technology is advancing. Many schools have thrown out he old fashioned paper and pencil learning style. Many schools have computerized progams that students use majority of their time spent in school. As they said in the passage this stystem can detect when a student is getting bored, or even when a student is not understanding. Many students don't learn at a high learning pace, so having a computer progam that understands that and detects when a student is having trouble is good. A teacher can't be everywhere at once, so if a progam is able to detect that, and help the student thats also helps the teacher out.

Second, students faces don't lie. You would be able to tell a confused face from a mile away. If computers detected when students were confused this is an easier way of finding out what the student needs help with. If a computer program is explaining a subject step by step, and all of a sudden the computer detects the student becoming confused this helps a teacher know were a student became lost. Many students won't admit to them not knowing, they'll try and find a way to understand,but at the same time many won't.

Lastly, this one idea can lead to further inventions. It many more things you can create when it comes to face action recgonition. With technology running the world today you never know what somebody can come up with. For example, Apple uses face recgonition for a possible way to unlock your phone. Another example is robots. Another example is a face scanner that could take attendance for you as students come into your classroom. The Facial action coding can play a part in telling the child's mood as they enter. Technology is too advanced to not take takeover. If it was my call i'd say bring in the Facial Action Coding Systems.

In Conclusion, I do believe this is valuable. I belive it will help much more in a classroom than many people expect. My reasons with the technology being advanced, students face expressions, and the ideas can open further gateways to new inventions are some reasons on why I believe people should consider this to be in a classroom. With that being said, I do believe this would be valuable to a classroom.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

Now that am reading about this passage that is new technology called

Facial Action Coding system that can read emotions from people at are famous , Died, In can evening tell from a picture what kinda emotions they had in there picture i gotta say that awesome becuase now in days people always lie to people, Plugs it can be more easy for the police's in actually see what was going now insect of asking the crime what's going now in i know some of thses people like to lie thing they can run away from lie they won't becuase am pretty sure police would know about this technology coming up in everything would be more easy probabrly be less drama in get the job done!

I gotta say am happy that these technology is awesome in am happy this technology is out here in the reason why is becuase i had a little couisn that pass away in i just wish i could be closed to that technology in show them feedback of my little couisn pitures in explain to me ""What did she felt or what was in her mind what was the last words that she could of say in that piture felling her emotions i wish i can have that moment .

But about this technology about these students in classroom is varible about there emotions how they feel,sad,happy,bull,any type of emotions,That these student having there type of emotions how they facing there self into other computer in telling each other about there feeling of there piture in isee there going along with it in see the cool techology around in am pretty sure it nice beucase you proabrly your friends feeling towards someting eles in see how they feel .",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2

Now I have read an article about that technology and I kind of understand what that technology mean. I think that technology is good for the human becasue example when you have someone in your home that has mentel problems and that person can't talk maybe that person has some problems with taliking so you can use that technology to see how that person feel and what that person need from you. here is another example for the schools, pretent you are a teacher at a school and your school is using the facial action coding technology system in computer, let say your students is using that computer to do school works or maybe serching someting that you tell them to do if they toutch the computer you will know how they feel, are they bored?, are they sad?, do they have a problems with that? or do they want to do your work or not. It depends on how they feel you might change your mind sometimes if they are really in a sad satuations. there might be a lot of kids at school that they don't want to come to school sometimes because they have a problems with their bodies or a problems inside but they still have to come to school for some reason if we that . computer at school we can see how they feel we will know are they feel sad or not sometimes we should give them someday to become happier from sadder school should understand thses kids so everyone will have a happy life with that facial action coding system. They should have sell those computer out by right now because as soon as we have that system more people will become understand another people and they won't hurt to the other person as much as becfore because they will understand a person from inside so i believe they won't hurt each oher not as muvh as now. If that new technology come out people will become less faker than before because they can't hide the truth anymore we will find out if that person is lying or not. If that new txchnology the facial action coding come out there will be alot more happier in the world I believe that the world will become more visiable and we will understand eachother no matter what language we are speaking now we will become a really really big family with that technology.

E8DD7458130E,"This article talks about ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"". In this article we learn about a machine that can that detects or identifies your emotions, whether sad, happy, angry, confused, or surprised this machine does it all.

This machine found out that she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry. This software is the latest innovation from Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam. This software actually calculates peoples emotions like a math homework. The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles, Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit"".

Dr. Huang observes that facial expression for each emotions are universal even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression. Using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. By weighting he different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions as in da Vinci's masterpiece.

In fact, we human perform this same impressive calculation everyday. For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried and so on. Yet Dr huang obsereves that artists such as Da vinvi studied human anatomy to help paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anaomical information as electronic code.

I think this machine could be very useful in different situations like in offices, classrooms and even in personal homes. I would like it in classroom because it could tell whether students have a problem with something. I think this software could be a great thing for a classroom. Imagine a classroom computer that knows when you are happy or sad. For exapmle, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow it. But if you frown, the next ad will be something different.

A classroom computer could recognize when a student s becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify a lesson, like an effective human instructor. The same technology can make computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery. I think if a computer is able to do this it will make boring or less interesting classes more interactive, fun and understandable which makes students more willing to learn and will understands things better.

I think this new upcoming software will help make class more interesting and fun for students because if this software can read someone's emotions it wil surely know when a students is getting bored or if a student is confused. I think the will make students learn more.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
10CBDD983149,"In the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile""The author said their is a new technology that can identify human emotion its name is the Facial Action Coding System. why is it improtant? it improtant becaues we can accuracy perceiving an emotion of someone or something. for example like the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci we can take Mona Lisa and put it facial coding system. then we can know her emotional. in the text it said "" she 83 percent happy, 9 percent disduste and 6 percent fearful"" it cool how they can get emotional of artwork.

The two people that make the coding system are Professor Thomas Huang and Professor Nicu at the university of lllinois, and the university of Amsterdam. To start, The computer make a 3-D model of the face with the major muscles. Then using video imagey the software recognize the factial movement. Then it be classified with in six basic emtions.

3D1481DF945D,"This technology could cause so many problems. This technology is invading a persons privacy. People also don't want to be asked what's wrong when they are sad and they don't want anyone to knwo because its personal. Also this type of technology can get in the wrong hands and they can use it to take advantage of people. This advanced technology is too much ti handle for us and we dont't need this to be a distraction to people getting an education and getting your work done in the workforce.

First of all the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is advanced that it would go into people's privacy and could get sued. Everyone tries to hide their emotions because everyone doesn't have t know how they feel sand with this everyone will know. Invasion of privacy is not a good or the right thing to do. Also if someone is going through a really tought time or if they are sad and don't want people to know this technology will let people find out and its personal people would get mad or just won't want to step out of the hosue because ebryone can figure out how they feel. I believe this technology could go into the wrong hands. Someone could get this type of technology and once they figure out how you are feeling they can go and try and comfort you if you let them and they coul hurt you or attack you because you justs howed them a weak side of you. FACS also can be a huge distarction in school or in the workforce. People would worry more about how people are feeling rather than doing their work. Teens wouldn't get an education and employees wouldn't get no work done. Teachers wouldn't be able to teach because students wouldn't be focused on their assignements but more on each other.

All in all, this is not a good idea. FACS can ruin people's live emotionally. Students will be more focused on why another student is upset or angry than doing work and getting an education. Then they will be invading a persons privacy and they will be in their personal life. Also in the workforce no one will get their work done. This technology could get in the wrong hands and just predators cna use this and people won't even know.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
5A1EAD973EF6,"The use of FACS should not be used to see if children are happy in the class room. The reason being is if a kid is upset about what happen at lunch and doesnt want the teacher to know the teacher shouldn't know. IF the kid wanted the teacher to know the kid would stay after class and tell the teacher the proble. i jiust dont think that there should be that kind of technology inside of a class room.

Now if it was for an expermint to see how you are really feeling then go ahead but only for an expermint. the expermint could be hpw many real emotions can one person feel all at the same time. The computer could tell you all the emotions what percent your feeling them and that how you get your expermint.

A teacher should not do it to anyone who does not want it done to them. That would be the only real problem with having it inside a class room. There could be a public room inside the school for the computer, so kids can go and see what they are feeling before class. That is an option for the school.

The only way i think it is a good idea to have that kind of tecnology inside school is if it has its own room inside the school. That way all the kids that want to use the computer can use it.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
11F4FD622FD8,"The Facial Action Coding System is a very useful tool used to help tell what other peoples emotions are just by their facial expresions. Having this technology can be very helpful in the classrom. It can help define the mixed emotions of a student, how they feel of a topic they are learning, and if a student is telling the truth.

The first reason as to why this technology is useful in the classroom is defineing the mixed emotions of students. In the artical it says ""The software can even identify mixed emotions"" (paragraph 4). Being able to identify mixed emotions of a student can be helpful. Sometimes a student may be stressed and upset over something, making it hard for them to concentrate on their work. You can't just let them not work though, but knowing their feelings you may be able to take it more slow paced for them that day. The student may have felt angry and stressed before they came into class, explaining why they got so upset when they couldn't find their homework.

Another reason this would be useful in class is by defining how they feel about a topic in class. In this article it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored... Then it could modify the lesson"" (paragraph 6). Having this tool say when they are confused is extraemly helpful. It lets the teacher know they may need some extra help, and the computer know to explain things in a different way. When a student becoms bored of what they are doing it becomes hard for them to concentrate, or causes them to want to rush through.

The final reason Facial Action Coding Systems should be in classrooms is because it can help tell when a student is lying. In paragraph 8 of the article it says ""Muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a 'smiling' politcian or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This can help a teacher know when an anxious student needs help, but says they don't. Some students may be too anxious to actually speak up when they need help, causing them to lie when a teacher ask them if they do. This also comes in handy when a student has done something and no one knows who it was, like tearing down a poster or putting a tac on the teachers seat.

In conclusion, this technology would be very useful for classrooms to define a students emotions to improve work, help a confused or bored student, and spot out lairs.",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8
280BCD5968F0,"The use of technology is widely used today and is making our world diffrent and more easier everyday. Technoldgy could be used for good things but, also used for bad. But either way we made it and its ours to use. Technology helps us look into many things that are important to us. Technology tells us what the weather is, or whats happening in a city far away. Either way it helps us look deeper in what we wanna know. Would you want to know how someone felt really by one scan of a machine/computure?

There is a new software, latest innovation of Prof. Thomas Huang. He and his colleague are making ways where technology and humans could commuinicate better. They are trying to see how people really feel and are they okay. This technology could be vary valuable, since now a days we use it like crazy. if we had gotten software that could see how we feel maybe students could be better at many things and technology would know how to help us interact with them.""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" paragraph 6, lines 5-8.

We as the users of technology should have our computers know what we want and what we don't want, if we use those and we use Dr. Huang's idea and we get what we want and many providers could be outreached and many providers will get the audience they wnat and what the users of technology will also get what they really want.""so computers need to understand that, too.""paragraph 6, line 11-12. Dr. Huang expresses that technology needs to understand us so we coukld let them knoiw what we want and what the consumer wants.

There is also many peopel who go undiagnosed for what they have. Many people show how they feel or what they are thinking by their expression.

If a person wants to be happy all day let them be , and you can tell by thier face exprestion or by the actions they do through out the day..In paragraph three it's showing us by saying ""

raise your eyebrows when you're suprise ; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth)tighten your lips to show anger"" every person that i know off knows that .Why tell us information that we already know ?

In the very top off the article of mona lisa's picture you can totally see thats shes happy,ferful. And i only looked at the picture for some secounds which makes no sence of why i'll need a device to tell me how she feels. In paragraph six it's showing us that if your in a classroom confuse a teacher can stop the lesson and tell you which part you don't get . Which is good at some point it's not because what if the teacher stop because of one student and then seconds later or minutes later the person changes to a complety different mood . At the end i think that there's no need for you to know if the person if feeling bad or happy .What if the person is feeling not so good because of family issues? As a person , we wanna just move on and not remind are self of what just happen because it'll make us more disapointed then we already are.

B3176BB24009,"In a school, there are clasrooms upon classrooms that are all teaching different, new, and exciting classes. When walking down a hallway, it is more than possible that the sounds of logorithmic functions could be taught to your left as Shakespeare might be being recited to your right. If you take a turn, one kid may be leaving his photography class to go take pictures for the yearbook while another may be returning from the restroom to go back to her chemistry class where she is studying saturated and unstaurated solutions. Despite the intense differences and varities of classes that there are at a high school, not every one of them is ""new"", ""different"", and ""exciting,"" as used previously to describe the classrooms scenes to all kids. Therefore, if it were at all possible that these kids could feel and want to be more engaged in their classes that take up a large portion of their week and youth, the way to do so should be evident in the classrooms. With this in mind, the idea that using Facial Action Coding Systems in classrooms would be valuable is not only true, but something that should be acted upon. (D'Alto).

In the life of someone that is attending school, there is one idea that is always looming over their shoulder. Whether it be like a cloud on a rainy day or a shadow following them on a sunny one, grades are always an important factor in a school-goer's life. Therefore, if this porgram would be able to help kids to be more interested in a topic and be more involved, they may just have improved grades from this system. In the text, the excerpt, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming cofused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts,"" shows that student's attention could be analyazed. (D'Alto, 6). With this being done, if the computer would be able to recgonize confusion, the student could then be introduced to a better way to learn the material or a way that they beter understand it, then leading to better grades. (D'Alto, 6). Also, the grades of the students could improve based on what the computer decides to do with as much human touch as it can. The passage, ""'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'"" shows that there is a solution to any problems a kid may have with what they are learning. (D'Alto 6). The fact that the computer attempts to try and help the students with a human touch shows that it would have the capibilties to do it's best and help the students to learn better, overall improving the student's grades. (D'Alto 6). With both of these examples in mind, it can be seen that the inclusion of this sytem into classrooms would have the capability to improve both a student's grades and understanding.

When a kid is sitting in a classroom for an hour, atleast, every day to every other day, there is seemable reason as to why and how a kid could get easily side tracked and/or bored. Despite this being true, the inclusion of this program into student's lives may have the ability to greatly improve student's engagement and interest in the classroom. In this article, the author includes, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional connection,' notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too,'"" shows just how the students may become more engaged and interested in their classes that take up so much of their week days. (D'Alto 6). If the computers would be able to connect with the students, there is no reason that these kids would not feel more obligatred to pay attention and more interested to learn what is being taught. (D'Alto 6). Another reason that these kids would gain more by having this system in their schools is the idea that would engage them in a fun manner. When the author included, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can really do,"" the reason is stated so in the text. (D'Alto 6). By including this piece, the author is showing that there, overall, is a fun factor to this could intrigue the students and keep them interested in their assignments and school overall. With these two ideas in mind, it can be seen that, as the attention of students is a primary need for schools, if this could improve just that, there is no reason not to include it in student's lives.

As science is an ever-budding field by it's own nature, there is no reason that a new technology wouldn't thrive among those interested in both science and technology. Therefore, as this is something that is new and up and coming, the addition of this to clasrooms may spark a pasion for this subject and inspire a career to form. In the excerpt, ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanvced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam,"" shows just how recent this technology is. (D'Alto 1). With this in mind, if students were able to be introduced and subject to this technology, there could be future scientist that want to further improve this technology and, until then, would be more involved in it's place at school. (D'Alto 1). Also, due to the fact that this technology is not only limited to the classroom, it is then evident that other jobs could be produced out of this technology being in the classroom, sparking interest in young and vulnerable students. As the author includes, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games or video surgery,"" it is showsn just exactly how various the fields are that this technology could be used in. (D'Alto 6). Whether a kid is devoted to learning about medicne or engrossed in playing games, it has been shown that this technology in the classrooms would expose these kids to it's capabilities and potentially create a passion. (D'Alto 6). Therefore, by including this technolgy in the classroom with it's own purpose, the students would be subject to technolgy that is blooming in several fields and could easily inspire a child to become something that utilizes this technology in their future.

As kids are ever-subject to new and upcoming ideas, it is evident that the addition of recent techology could aid their progression in school and would be deemed as important and valuable to include. If a kid were someone that easily lost interest in a course or was not very interested in a certain class, they may then be more provoked to learn and pay attention if this new technology was included at their school and interested them. By doing so, there is potential that the student would then be able to improve their grade and get much out of this porgram. Also, if a student were to be even intrigued in this technology, there could be potential for this studen to go into a job field that dealt with this type of technology as there are many that vary greatly in doing so. Overall, the inclusion of present innovations and technology should be including the next generations, as success for them now will lead to future success for all.",6,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,1.0

""The proccess begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" and all 44 important muscles in the model must move like human muscles.""it also says that we may some times not really know what is wrong with our friends and sometimes we can becaus of there facial expresion. or just behavior in general but sometimes they dont want to show that emotion or what is in them the computer can detect all of that.

so i personally think it would be great because some people are usually shy and wouldnt really express there selfs to the class as if they were with there friends. so all we would have to do is just by a sinlge glimpes on the computer we can tell what is going on maybe something happend. and she doesnt really know what to do so she seeks help from a counceler and she just checks what is going on with her and just by that maybe her whole life could change by checking the computer. tech is advancing a lot and is helping the sociatey positivley and yet negativlily but hopefully one day it will all come down to nothing but potive stuff.

The article states ""A classroom computer can recognize when a student is confused or bored and modify the lesson accordingly to the student's personal pace and speed.

There are six basic emotions which are happiness,suprise,anger,fear,disgust, and sadness. The article states""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal "".

The facial action coding system works by scanning the movement of your muscles 'in your face to see and understand how a student feels. Another reason this will be a valuable tool in schools is because it could have prevented a school stabbing in Pennsylvania because the Facial Action Coding System could have seen that if the student wasnt happy and was angry the staff could have stepped in and given the kid help before he did anything dangerous to other peers and staff.

in summary,The Facial Action Coding System can be valuable in a classroom setting by seeing if if a student is confused or bored and can modify the lesson accordingly. Another reason is it could have prevented alot of bad things from happening to schools. For example, the school stabbing in Pennsylvania by seeing that the kid was unhappy and angry and therefore, the staff could have stepped in and got him help before anyone was even hurt. The Facial Action Coding System is a very helpful tool.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
BF1C765F688F,"Technology is advancing at a rapid rate and is consuming our lives. With the new software created by Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe, computers are now able to recognize human emotion. This technology can be useful for various things. The software can make video games more realistic, it can give more insight on psychology, and it can even be useful in classrooms.

Often, children in classrooms do not understand certain things, but may be too shy to ask questions. With the emotion recognition, teachers will be able to tell who is understanding the topic and who is struggling. Another way the software can be helpful to classrooms is that if it shows a child is upset about something, but tries not to show it, that may be a clue that they're struggling with something outside of class. When a child is in a bad state, they will most-likely not try in their classes, but if a teacher could talk to them and help them, it could be a good way to get the child to vent and relieve the pressure from themselves, causing their grades to go up. Lastly, the software can help teachers notice bullying. Many times kids get let off the hook for bullying someone because, ""they were just kidding around"", ""we're buddies"", but that is not really the truth. If the emotional recongition software is installed in schools, teachers will be able to notice if a kid out of a group of people is feeling uncomfortable while the other kids are laughing. Stopping each of these problems will allow the children to make better grades, be less stressed, and hopefully enjoy school.

Technology is a big piece of this generation and it has come a long way and has helped society a lot. The advancements in them are drastic and they continue to become more useful to society. The emotional recognition software can help make many impacts on this world to make it become a nicer place. Using the software in classrooms would be an awesome start.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
B1AF3AD74555,"In the article the author talks about machines and computers that can tell what a person is feeling like. The author does make very valid points in the article, explaining and giving well thought out details about the process as it helps us readers understand. The author claims that this machine can tell what you are feeling by ur facial structure in the moment and how your cheek bones and eyebrows and other parts of your face affect that. This is very valuable because the author has plenty of evidence behind it all. An example is the Mona LIsa. They inspected all of her bones in her face with one of these machines and results came back and seemed very valuable with reasoning. This also could easily help students like us in the future, students are very well off task a lot of tines and makes it very boring for us to learn things. So machines like this can keep us and teachers on track when we are not focused or even learning.

Students very often get bored of learning the same way and same pace as others. The students get very eager to learn a new way and not the same all the time. These machines can recognize when we arent learning properley by telling that we are bored or not focused. For an example in the article it states that, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is confused or bored"", ""Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."" This explains how we could be getting a new way to learn just by a machine guiding us by itself to do so. This could very much help students everywhere out, because we know that all student dont learn as affective and the some pace. So the students who need it all slowed down a little can have a much better learning experience because it can tell when you need this kind of help.

This technology would definitley help out students now and in the future, it gives them a more wide and better learning experience. This FACS is very intelligent telling what and how people are feeling in any type of moment and situation, just by bones in your face. Now affording these in classrooms might be a big issue because they will be overpriced for schools to even have some if any. Low income schools will be in a very tough situation with this because unfortunatley lower income schools are the ones that need these machines the most, to help the chidren get the type of education that they want, and need. So as long as prices arent varied by place and can stay low, all schoold should have these types of learning tools because it really does help these children, and could have a better success rate in lower schools.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

A computer program could know how you are feeling based on your facial expression. In the passage it states that, ""It's all about those muscular action units. They can even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one."" This shows that a computer program can tell how you are feeling even when you may try to hide it or force a smile.

The Facial Action Coding System could also adjust your program to make you happier with your program. For example, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr. Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This shows that FACS is able to make the lesson into something you can enjoy. This can Improve grades and overall attitudes in classrooms.

The program can make you happier overall and allow you to succeed in school. It states in the passage, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them."" This shows that smiling can help you become happier. The program is made to allow you to feel certain emotions and adjusts the program based on your feelings. For example, if you are getting bored with the work that the program is providing it can alter the work to what you can feel more comfortable with.

FACS is valuable because a computer program can know how you feel, adjust your program to meet your needs, and make you happier.

074343AB6EC8,"The Facial Action Coding System or known as ""FACS"" is a software that 3-D prints the picture exactly how it is with all the 44 major muscles that are identical to the person in the picture. From there it goes to psychologists and they classify the type of emotion that they see in the 3-D model. The psychologists refer to the six classified basic emotions which are Hapiness, Surprise, Anger, Disgust, Fear, and Sadness.

Having this in a classroom would be a cool idea but in my opinion i think there is no need for something like this in a classroom. The students may find it interesting but it wont teach them anything unless they are studying to be a psychologist or something related to that. The students may or may not like this but if they do come out with something like they were talking about when they said an ad popped up and the computer sees yout frown and puts a similar ad on the screen the computer will recongize that you are getting bored or not liking that so the computer would change the type of ad. If they come out with this then i can see it being used in the schools where students can learn what makes them mad or happy.

When it comes to ""FACS"" in the classroom it might not be the best option for students to learn about that unless they want to have a career similar or like a psychologist they should keep the ""FACS"" to the people who made it to make technological improvements and release it to people who would need this to help patients and then release it to students who are in college or a type of school that have students who want to be a psychologist or to people like video game designers who need this to make better improvements to characters int the games they are creating.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2

440A223D41D5,"Leonardo De Vincis famous painting is the Mona Lisa. The Mona Lisa is known all over the world today. There has been many of debates about weather she is smiling or if she has any eyebrows. It took Leo to paint the hands 4 years alone.

Today Thomas Huang has now made an invention. Huang has came up with a technology called Facial Action Coding System which is where computers can caculate up the real emotions of a student or person. Studies show that this technology system can read all your emotions you're feeling. It can tell if you're sad,happy,angry and lots more of emotions. Huang states in the text that they tell your emotions by the muscles on your face.

Huang also goes on saying that he can pin point out emotins on kids in school. In my defence I dont this this would work accuratley. Not only do i think it would work. Many of teacher would not want to get out that device in the middle of class just to see your kids emotions. Many of kids fake smile or act like they are happy when really they are not. Studies show that they are identified by the muscles but you could easlily get told to smile which changed your muscles which changed the game.

Many of student come to school depressed or upset. Many of teacher do not know if they are really happy or not. This technology I feel would not be valuable because maybe the student do not want people to know there emotions. Emotions should be kept private and with this technology it would be open to everyone in a classroom.

Overall I feel like this would not benifit anything. I also feel like this would not be valuable to students in classrooms. Therefore This technology may help on paints.

They show their emotions with facial expressions which also let's other people around them know what their current feelings could be. Although some people's expressions are hard to read due to them not showing emotion in their face or hiding it,they can go through a process in a computer system named 'Facial Action Coding System' in other words FACS ,which makes the computer determin their feeligs. This is also a good system for when historians are trying to figure out old pantings like The Mona Lisa. This computer system can work well because it determins a persons feeling,it can help make better computer-animated faces more expressive,and it can help modify a teaching lesson according to the student liking.

First the computer system can tell what a person's feelings are. In paragraph four it read ""By weighting the different units,the software can identify mixed emotions. Each expression is compared againts a neutral face"". Another example can be found in paragraph five, it talks about how the computer software stores simliar codes to figuring out emotions and also talks about Da Vinci studing human anatomy to help him paint human facial expressions. These two examples show somewhat how the computer system works and how effective it when it comes to facial expressions.

Secondly FACS can help develope better computer-animated facial expressions. In paragraph six it read ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery"" Another example is found in paragraph three when the author talks about 3-D computer models of the faces. He also talks about the muscles used when we make an expression. This two examples can show how FACS can help figuring out which facial expression is used and how to demonstrate it more strongly.

Lastly FACS can help figuring out lessons based on the students facial expression. In paragraph six it said ""A classroom computer cpu;d recognize when a students is becoming confused or bored,""Dr Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor. Another example is found in paragraph four when the author talks about individuals showing vary degrees of expression making it hard to tell exactly what they feel. This examples show that knowing a students main emotion to a lesson can help modify a special lesson making them enjoy it better and learning more.

In conclusion FACS can be very usual when it comes to determening and knowing exacly one's feeling. It can also be useful when historians need to figure out emotions people felt during erlier times based on a panting. FACS also can show the many different moods a persons facial expression can contain.

This new advanced technology isn't valuable in a classroom enviroment. In a classroom it depends on the reason, and the student for this technology to be used. This system in a classroom can be taken advantage, and not used correctly.

The ""Facial Action Coding System"" being used in a class isn't very valuable, unless a student is always sad, and not doing well in school. No one wants everyone knowing their personal issues. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" (by Nick D' Alto) it states "" The facial expresstions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (para 4). Dr. Huang is saying that there is several emotions, even though people show expressions very little or not very much.

But even if a person is more to their selves the system can still read you're emotions even if you aren't really showing any.

Some people won't want their expressions read by people they don't really know.

They also might not even want to talk about thier personal issues, because they just don't want to stress about it or because they don't want people judging them. This system can be taken advantage of for the wrong reasons in a classroom, and not be valuable. If this system is used in a class room it has to be for the correct reasons and not just because you think someone is always ""mad"" or ""sad"", and it might not always be the case. It has to be because you want to help a student, because they might be going through a rough patch in life and need someone to talk to. But if this new system is used to help someone, it should be in private; where no one is around.

In conclusion, the new technology "" Facial Action Coding System"" is not valuable in a classroom.

07D3CBDEFCEF,"Growing up in a constantly changing environment, students have had to learn to adapt to the world around them. In school, students are taught to be open and ready to learn, while still facing the ups and downs in the journey of childhood to adulthood. Students make close bonds with their friends and even a few choice teachers. Students choose to whom they share their emotions with and at what time they wish to do so. Emplimenting a computer system in schools that is capable of reading a students emotions is inappropriate, lazy, and dangerous.

This technology is incredible. It's capable of easily figuring out what someone feels right when they're feeling it. Empathy is an intimate ability one experiences with another. Most people have the ability to sense others emotions, ""For instance, you can probably telll how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" There is a prominent understanding in the natural world regarding emotions. Sometimes not every one wants to be figured out and displayed to their peers. In school, students are faced with one major task: to learn. Teachers are faced with the task of teaching. A teacher's job is to engage students and the students job is to stay engaged with the teacher. Emplementing facial reading teachnology is innappropriate and dangerous to the privacy of students, and it threatens the basic principles school systems were founded upon. Teachers and students have major jobs to do at schools and this technology might distracted from the main goals of schooling. Students want to be cared about and valued but not by everyone or at any time a computer chooses. Students may feel uncomforatble if teachers ask how they're feeling. A student has friends and family to confide in, and may not want everyone to know the personal and private issues they are going through. If students emotions are displayed to their peers and teachers, they might feel awkward opening up, because they aren't comfortable around them.

Furthermore, this technology could be used in the wrong situations. The article stated that a smart school computer could tell when students are getting bored or confused and change the lesson, ""' A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. Then is could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This example puts teachers in an awkward position. Letting a smart, facial reading technology teach students would mean the teachers aren't teaching. Giving power to technology is complacent, instead of working with people to improve learning habits or teaching methods, adults would be taking the easy way out. This technology had the purpose of connecting humans in focus but instead it will further divide them. Students don't want to be analyzed by computer systems; they want to be cared about by other humans. If the goal is to focus on students emotions, adults should take some time out of the day to talk face to face, instead of sticking the child in front of a computer monitor.

Some might argue that these computers might be a useful tool for counselors in schools. This is a valid argument, but this also compromises the position of school counselors. Their job is to connect and work with students. When introducing a computer system, students may realize they are just another task to be completed in the work place. Every year, students are analyzed to see where they place on the national benchmark for their education, they take standardized tests to see how much they know, they do hearing tests and eye tests, but a computer has yet to analyze them to see how happy they might be. If computers are introduced to read emotions, students may feel like they are just a number or rank of emotions. If students go to their counselors, they want to be talked to and connected with. Bringing in a computer can divide the connection from child to adult. The child may feel alienated and refuse to converse with the adult. This computer may seem like a helpful tool, but it destroys the importance of human connection.

The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be. Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are. Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools. Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings. Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools. This technology falls flat in the category of connection. Don't take the easy way out, instead of analyzing emotions with a computer, ask someone how they are. If a student looks upset, sit down and talk with them. Show someone they are valuable and deserve one on one human interaction.",6,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,1.0
59AE73CF9D53,"Have you ever looked at a friend and they thought there was someething wrong wgen there was nothing wrong. Well I think this technology can be very valuable because it can give the percent of how people are,find what they feel even if they look differnet, and it will give you steps to help.

First it give the percent on people and all they feel. They just have to do the math and look at all the muscles in there body. Then they will put it in the six different feelings. Then add it all up and which every one is the highest is what that person is feeling.

Second it will make sure we are not thinking wrong about someone who looks like thet are feeling something when really its something else. It will give you an ad for how you are feeling and mak you watch it,but if you start to feel something else then it will give you a different ad to watch. It will give you a lesson how what you are feeling so you wont get board.

Last reason is it will give you steps to help you. step one it might tell you to lift the corners of your mouth. Second it will tell you to crow's-feel around your eyes. It will know if you are lieing and it will wait till you are telling the truth about it. It knows how important feelings can be so it wants the right one.

That is why I think that this technology is very valuable and will be helpful later in life. It might help people start staying out of fights and getting in trouble.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
98CD5DB0062C,"Have you ever wanted to know how someone was feeling, whether it was a student, family member, or even a friend? Well with the help of the Facial Action Coding System, now you can do just that. Facial Action Coding System or ( FACS ) for short is a new computer program that can classify up to six differnet emotions by the movement of all 44 major facial muscles. This invention was created by Prof. Thomas Huang. But here is the real question, would this technology be valuable in a classroom?

For us humans, some may find it easy to tell how someone is feeling based on the look on their face. But for others it isn't so easy. Say a teacher for example, is teaching a science lesson. With this type of technology the teacher would be able to tell if his or her students are understanding the topic being taught, or if they are bored and about to fall asleep. This could change every way that a lesson is being taught in every classroom around the world. This could even raise test scores for kids and teens around the globe.

With this type of technology, you could tell how someone is feeling based on the muscle movements in their face. FACS works based on what's called muscular action units. These action units are all of those 44 major, as well as some minor facial movements. This system is the most accurate system out there for telling how someone is feeling based on their muscle movements. For example, take the zygomatic major. This is the muscle that begins at your cheek bones which helps you create your smile. Or the frontalis pars lateralis muscle. This is the muscle above your eyes which helps raise your eyebrows when you are surprised.

Based on all the research, there is the six basic emotions, happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. All these emotions happen in a classroom more then anyone would ever imagine. If students were having trouble understanding a math lesson, then this technology could pick that up if the student didn't say they were confused. This technology could be very useful for teachers because it could give them feedback about what they need to do better, or go over more throughly. It could even give them the chance to even change the whole lesson all together and slow it down for students to understand.

So how valuable would this technology be in a classroom environment? Well in my opinion it seems very important. I say this because the technology could tell whether a student was comprehending a lesson, and if they weren't. This technology could also give feedback to the teacher to show if they need to show the lesson over so the students could understand the topic better. This technology could possibly even raise test scores based on the feedback it gives teachers, all based on the looks on the students faces. This new technology known as Facial Action Coding System could help teachers comprehend their students and if they are learnig, confused, or even excited.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
31F109F70507,"The Facial Action Coding System recognizes human emotions. It builds a 3-D computer model of the face. Which can detect the emotions of a human. It now being used in schools to detect the students facial expression.

The use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is not valuable, because its not going to help them with anything. Its not going to change how they feel, In paragraph 6 the author states that ""Aclassroom computer can recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused"". The computer is not going to help them change their emotion.

Also, the computer is going to be able to recognize their emotions, but its not going to make them feel different. If the computer sees that a student is sad or mad, its not going to make them feel better. It is just going to know how they feel. Its not going help them at all. They are still going to do the same thing on the computer as they were before.

They detected the Mona Lisa painting. In paragraph 1 the author said that ""she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, and 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"". That did not change how the painting looks. They just recognize how she was feeling. Its still the same painting as it was before. Her facial expression did not change at all. At schools computers are going to do the same, the students are not going to change how they look and feel.

The Facial Action Coding System is not valuable, because it is just going to detect how they feel. It is not going to really change anything. The system is not going to provide them with anything to make their emotions change. I feel like they should not have that, because they know how they are feeling and other people are going to know to. ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
57280EFE34F4,"I am doing a essay about technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. I dont think technology can tell someone in emotes by scanning their face. It cant go thou are mind and say they are feeling sad. Us humans can tell if they are sad or happy because we have been thou the same things they are going thou.

If it is true I would not use because if they are using it as a govement weapon to find if some one is hinding some well needed things and they start to used this and if it gives them wrong information that person might be in some trouble. And the other way around if they have some need information and the FACS or Facial Action Coding System just lost it.

If it can do this. This thing will be ahead in technology and clear a path for us in the near furture. But I dont blieve this computer can tell people feelings. First how big is it? Is it the size of a gym or is it as small as a Iphone 4? This computer is just a big fake.

Second how much does it cost? Is it the same to build it as much as a lamborigini or as much as a pencil? Third, how long does it take to build it. And how long does it last for. 1 minites or 3 hours. How long does it scan for.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
5BAD13A833BC,"A computer reading your emotions? In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smila"" the author talks about how Facial Action Coding System is able to read emotions and how it may help students in the classroom. This technology in a classroom will not be beneficial because it is costly, may distract students, invades privacy, and may lead to ineffective learning.

In paragraph 7 the author states ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"". The average home PC's price ranges from about $200 USD to $500 USD. Since the average home computers can not handle these algorithms then the school must purchase higher end computers which will be very costly since every student will need one. Also every student travels throughout the school so the school must be able to purchase laptops with this advanced hardware and software so that the students will be able to use them in every class they attend.

In paragraph 6 of the article the author states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and ""then it could modify the lesson"". When in a lesson at school not every student will enjoy the lesson, which will cause them to have a bored or even tiresome expression. Having this expression will cause the computer to attempt and make the lesson more intresting; but what if the student is still bored? The computer will keep trying to modify the lesson which could cause it to lead away from the original goal of the lesson so much that the student is no longer focused on the original topic.

Having a computer constantly reading your emotions will invade on your privacy. Paragraph 6 states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" ""Then it could modify the lesson"". When detecting the student is bored or confused it will have to relay this information to the teacher letting them know that due to the student's emotion that it will be modifying the lesson to accomodate them. This means that when a student may be having a bad day or may just be in a bad mood that it will recognize that and store that information so that the teacher can know. The student may not have wanted anyone to know but now this program doesn't allow that student his right to privacy.

Since this program will be modifying your lesson due to your emotions it may lead away from what the teacher was originally trying to teach. If the intended goal is to teach the student how the mitochondria works withing a cell but the student has a bored face on the program will try to modify the lesson. When the lesson is modified it will try to catch the attention of the student even if it has to continue modifying th elesson. The lesson can be modified to such an extent that the student does learn the lesson partially but not as exstensively as the teacher had originally intended.

Facial Action Coding Systems is a great asset in scientific field. The program though is not practicial within a setting such as a classroom. The program may lead to expensive purchases for the school, more distractions for the students, privacy invasion, and lessons which do not teach exactly as intended.

D17B54620565,"What if you could decect what other people are feeling even when trying to hide it? Well,in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" it explains how techonology called Facial Action Coding System(FACS) can identify human emotions. They use a computer that structures a 3-D computer model of someones face. There are six basic emotions they look for, happiness, surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness.

To answer the question, yes, the use of this technology would be beneficial in the classroom. Sometimes teachers have a hard time trying to keep students alert and paying attention, with this software, it could make it easier. In paragraph six, Dr. Huang say,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a students is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson , like and effective human instructor"". Since most human communication is nonverbal , including emotional communication, it could be difficult.

In conclusion, having the new software and using it in the classroom could be very useful to help shape the minds of students. Making dfferent faces and having different attitudes can revel so much about the science of emotions.

2F5D866B2C48,"Is using Facial Action Coding System valuable in students classroom? There is alot of talk about using this in classrooms and in other places like so. I don't believe it would be a good decision because one, it would take up so much time, secondly, who says it calculates what is going on in your mind or your true feelings, thirdly why use it in classrooms of all places. There are just many more places it could be used rather than a classroom. Teachers have it hard enough grading the million and one asignments than going through and analyzing their students faces.

First, the Facial Action Coding System will take so much time in one class alone, we can't take away the education from the children in order to see what are emotions are by a face scanner. Let's say you are in a 55 minute math class notes take 30 to 40 minutes a day and the teaher lets students have the beginning 10- 15 minutes of class to ask about last nights homework that all equals 40-55 minutes a day. How would you fit 30 kids into a 10 minute slot to face scan them? That is one more obstical you are going to ask teachers to jump over when they already do so much and get paid so little.

Secondly, Just because a persons face says they are feeling a certain way doesn't mean that is how they truly feel. That is like saying put this mood ring on so I can see your mood. We all know mood rings are based off of body temperature and not your actual mood. There are somethings that people are feeling that they don't want to show, I am not saying that this is a bad thing to do, but maybe not for classrooms.

Thirdly, why in classrooms of all places? Children are very clumbsy there is a better chance it won't get broken at a docotrs office or maybe at a hospital, or anywhere else besides around children. The best place for this could be at a psychiactic unit to see how the psychiatic medication has effected the paitent from day one to now. Children aren't going to be in the same mood now if you check in on them in five minutes.

In conclution, schools should not have these. I think the Facial Action Coding System could be put to use somewhere else besides in a school. Schools are so busy trying to meet regulations, making teachers do what they are to do despite not getting paid very much, and lastly it is a new and improved mood ring we have just made it fancier and given it a new name.

6FAA9368824D,"This could be it, the new Facial Action Coding System ! This system is a very unique way to tell and spoil how you are really feeling and what your emotions are. This new system starts with a 3-D computer model and all of the human muscles. It will basically scan your face and tell you your emotions. I think this is a fantastic way to get people to change there mood or to tell how people really feel because people hide there emotions and this system could be a new big thing.

Some people may not agree on many things, but maybe people could try this. Some adults worry about how student or there children are feeling and if they did the Facial Action Coding System it would be a way to express there emotions and tell how they really feel. It's as simple as a fake or real smile, the rising of an eyebrow, or even the squinting of your eyes. All of those qualities can tell you what your emotions are with using the Facial Action Coding System. Like the passage states, "" The Mona Lisa demomstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face "", and so could the FACS. Seeing student down isn't pleasent and shouldn't be. Using the FACS is a way to tell, but don't put on a fake smile !

The Facial Action Coding System could go world wide and change lives. It could go to every school and make a difference ! This system could be valuable but some people may see it different. Not everyone would want to do this because some don't want to express there emotions. If schools invested in this system, it could change those that don't want expressed to being expressed and happier. It could also just tell you where your're at and what emotions you could work on or otherwise. Some may like, and some may not. Reasearchers show the putting on a ""

For instence in paragraph three ""Eckman had classified six basic emotions happiness, suprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."". If they can use this to treat people who are not happy it can solve a bunch of problems in the future.

Many people may suffer from disorders like and anxiety disorder or a bi polar disorder, and many doctors and humans would much rather like to have these disorders treated verbally and face to face weither it be by talking to a councilor, threapist , your parents or a doctor. A computer does not need to be able to predict ones feelings, maybe the person does not want others to know how they feel.

In the passage it says that a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, so it could change up the lesson , well you don't know if the student is faking their emotions to be able to get the work modified in a fun way to put in less effort and work. This is taking technoogy almost way to far. Many people like to write down how they are feeling and thats better in a natural way than to have a piece of technology dictate your in this case emotions AND your future. Some things are best to just be adressed in a natural way like verbally talking to a human one on one or writing or excersising, Not sitting in front of a laptop or computer and having it read your emotions. You have to keep in mind some people don't want to have everything or everyone especially a computer knowing that much information about you, Thats like putting on the world wide news ""HEY IM SAD TODAY!""

Some students could be going through some personal things like puberty, dealing with a divorce or a death in the family and they may need to talk to someone about it , but I dont think that a computer that has been coded with millions of diffrent formulas and data softwares are going to releive that stress or pain. This upcoming of technology could leave some parents uncomfortable with sending their child to school to have a computer stare at them and predict their current emotion or mood.

First of all, the Facial Action coding system would be valuable in a classroom today because, it would make the lesson we do on the computer more intresting.

Ok, if someone took a picture and put it on facebook or something you wouldnt know how there felling you would just know what they wanted you to feel. Just because someone is smiling that doesnt mean they are happy, it just means they are smiling, but with the Facial Action Coding System we would know how the person is actualy felling

in fact we humans peform this same impressive ""caculation every day. for instance, you can probaly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face.

Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc. Dr. Huang observes that artists such as Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisley enough to covey specific emotions. His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code. Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of ""Da vinci code.

It is really hard to tell emtion sometimes. There's sometimes people who have a relaxed face, but is happy. I totally agree with the computer technology to tell emotion for paintings and illustrations. Although, I wouldnt recommend using it on students maybe for some people, but not for all. Certain students could take that very personal like ""invading their privacy"" situation type, but I certaintly wouldn't use it on students.

Constructing a 3-D model of the face of a painting or illustration I could understand that, but having the audacity to invade someones space would be a totally different story, when you could just ask them about their problems or just to even check up on them. Severall of students could take in the process personal, beause they might not want people to know that they're upset or angry only for the simple fact people can go and spread your business, or maybe they don't want to talk.

Permission of using it on students also matters. You're not just going to walk up to any person, take a picture of them, and then run away with it. Something is going to be said. The technology of it is so cool, but personally used on students, The professors and any other users have got to be out of their minds to use it for such reasoning on students. Realizing expressions throughout other humans are very common, only because we know what the emotions of sad, happy, excited, scared look like. We can tell when there's something wrong, because that's just our humanly instincts.

Supporting my evidence as to ""Most communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" notes Dr. Huang. ""Some computers need to understand that too."" I totally disgaree with that though computers shouldn't know all personal information on how which and who feels some kind of way when you can talk out their problems. They don't have to have a happy face to be happy, or a sad face to be sad. There are people who hide their feelings deep down inside faking their emotion on the outside. A lot of things you can't just ""up and tell"" human instincts don't work like that.

Came to thought that all technology is not meant for human interactions. Again, invading space just is not healthy or right for other people. Some may want to be left alone, not bothered with. Especially without permission. Things could change within the matter of seconds. Emotions are so common eve with the looks on their face, but there are going to be a lot times where other people hide them. Personal things just shouldn't be shared or forced on someone.

Some possitive thing about the new technology are adaptation and improvment. With this new technology we can use it to adapt different things like ads and school lessons. Ads can sometimes completely take out the interest on the viewers for the video and can be sometimes unpridictable. This has happend numerous times in classrooms when a teacher wants to show a documentary that is all ready slighty borring and an ad showing an exciting new superheroes movie comes up So now you have the entire class talking about it and not paying any atention to the documentary about Charles Darwin and what he did. Having these distracting ads adapt to what the audience is feeling could help bring down the amount of times this happens. The FACS could also help in computer lesson planing. If the FACS would be installed in a computer the computer would be able to realise that a student is no longer paying attencion becouse of boredom. So system can then improve what the lesson has by chnging the order around to give the student a more personalised lesson thus having the student learn easier.

There are some bad feedback as well. If the FACS system succeds in improving the academic scores of the students the school administration might deside that the teacher are no longer needed to teach the student, the students could just study in there cmputers. Another way the FACS could not be so good is that it is likely to be very expencive and there is ways a possibility it can malfunction and give unwanted changes in lessons and other sections in which it would be used.

In conclusion I think that the FACS could be of great help in the world if it could be 100% reliable.

The device has proven to be succesful at reading emotions of real people and portrait paintings. Using this piece of technology in the classroom would be beneifical for all parties involved.

Students experience a wide range of emotions during the average school day. The new tool could be used to indentify all of them. Starting with analysis of how students are feeling right when they walk in the door. This would be helpful to the school because it would allow them to identify students that need help as suggested by Dr. Huang. Eliminating the need for teachers to ask students for questions. Teachers would know exactly when students had a question, because he or she was making a face of confusion.

The emotion reading computer could also tell guidence councilers how children are really feeling about their current situation. Allowing for a deeper more pesonal conversation that would create a better enviroment for healing the students emotions.

Another, way that the machine could be helpful is that it could help teachers interven before students brawl. Instead of fighting the machine would assist those in charge by seeing the issue before it becomes one. According to Nick D'Alto the machince currently searches for the emotions, anger, surprise, happiness,disgust,fear,and sadness. Technology continues to make advances everyday and this machine would be able toe search for more emotions everyday.

Students require a vivid and visually entertianing lesson, with the new technology this is possible. Dr Huang believs that the machine could search for the emotion of boredom and then suddenly change the way the students recieve the message based on their attentiveness. This would be more useful because some teachers do not change they way they present the information. Technology with the ability to adapt to the needs of the students is important and another reason why it shoul dbe incorperated into school systems.

Others argure that the technology could be bad for schools. Some poeple believe that it would be a waste of the public's time to invest in something that can already be done by a person. Dr. Huang himself compared the compter to something similar to what humans would do when looking at emoitions of others. It would take jobs away from the area replacing teachers. These all may be true, but sometimes people missread emotions. Teacher can not teach and think about how ever childs emotions at the same time, this new technology would help teachers.

This just shows how outstanding the FACS is and how useful it can become within schools throughout the world.

In conclusion I feel that the FACS can be very benificial in the classroom and this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable. Feedback from the FACS can enchance the teacher's ability to teach in a more exciting classroom. It can help the teachers see which teaching mechanics need changed or improved and it can help set future classes to become more motivating and exciting. These are reasons why I believe that further action in this department is more than neccassary for our classrooms. As a student myself, there are some classes that could use a little more excitement. This can improve the work ethic of students and maybe more students won't skip school, because school then w il be exciting and will be a better learning environment.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

Wadonna wears a wig eveyrtime time you see her. elvis presely isn't dead. hitler many still be alive today. but we dont know any of these things, you see the idea that we claim things is sometimes true and can be sometimes unrealistic.

technoloy floods our brain, meaning there is so many inventions it just brainwashes us. We can use photo I.D. now for getting on to our phone. There are mixed emotions when we do show our personality, the techonolgy recognizes it. So we can change everything so someone says, ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" observes Dr. Huang. The mona lisa drawing is suppose to bring a smile to everyones face.

So people are still wandering what the mona lisa represents, the mona lisa represents art and beauty. There is a song called mona lisa, and its kinda a love song, saying your my mona lisa baby. So i think the whole idea of this song is to show that the mona lisa is a thing of beauty it represnts more than just beauty.

What else does it represent, well does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion? Do you feel mad or sad. if you felt sad and you were crying and you went to the mirror and looked in the mirror, what would you see in yourself because down deep inside if thing yuo incredibly hurt. Can your lab partner recgonize which emotion you are doing? yes there is a doctor for that. there are so many emotions you dint even know throughout the day.

in conclusion the many way we show emotions can be mixed up. The impolsovity or maybe catatonia, these emotions are so rare they are usually not effected by people.

0D7FAACC389B,"I feel like that the use of the emotional expressions of students in a class room is not good. First of all it is not 100% offical.. Second of all it could fill you computer with viruses. last one is that it could be a lot of money to get in and most likly to fix it. It is a lot of work getting one of those and the thing is why buy it or even consider it, if it is not offical.

The facial action coding system is not totaly offical. In the story it says that it uses you face to tell what going on or something. They say that they can tell if it is a real smile or a fake one by your muscules. The muscles called orbicularis make croe's feet around your eyes, but then a fake smile, the mouth is streched sidesways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle called the risorius. Then is said that if an ad pops up and you are happy then the facial action coding system is going to think you like it then more and more are going to be poping up. Sense it said that it can tell eveything just by four face. The rusults won't be right. For people that wear makeup the facial action coding system is not going to get the right results. You might have a facial problem or something wrong with you muscles. That you wouldn'd be able to simle perfectly. Then it will give you wrong results

The fact that facial action coding system is basiclly thinking and telling you how to feel it doesn't really know what you really feel. I feel like sense the camera is always going to just be watching you to see what you are feeling that is creepy. Like it said it if thinks your happy when an ad pops up it's going to pull up more and more ads and you might even get a virus. It is going to end up making some damages to your computer. Most likely people are not going to feel safe. What if someone gets to hack you computer. They are going to be watching you all day, everyday.

Sense it said that it will cost a lot of money to get it. I won't be fair if some schools have it and if some don't. The facial action coding system will be hard to get. Some school can just get enough for the basic's. If they can't even get enought to get one what if is stops working or something goes wrong. The people are going to have to find more moeny just ot fix it. Most likely, they are going to have to stop doing some clubs or some after school activities thing like that. Just to try to afford the moeny to fix the program. ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
866E03D00129,"The Facial Action Coding System is an invasion of privacy and should not be used in classrooms or on students. Students should chose when and to who they reveal their emotions, and this system deprives them of that freedom.

As stated in by Nick D'Alto, most human communication is not verbal. Meaning that people express their emotions by their looks or their actions, but they chose when to do this. The Facial Action Coding System takes away this freedom from students, they do not have the choice when to express what they are feeling if anyone can just use a face scanning system on them. "" Imagine being able to detect exaclty how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions (D'Alto 1),"" this first sentence perfectly shows how it takes away peoples freedom of when they want to express certian emotions tocertian people.

Every human has naturaul rights, and in America everyone has the right to freedom of speech. But part of that right to speech is having the choice not to speak.

405D9D4958DF,"Making technology that can identify human emotions would be important, but not very much in everyday use. If a student were not able to identify their emotions when seeing a therapist or school counsoler, then this device would work best their specifically because therapists/counsolers are trained to help with humans and their emotions.

Let's say that students are in a class to learn about psychology or somethig of the sort. It would be very useful to find out what a person is feeling down to the percent. This device would also be helpful there because it tells you about the muscles that move to show a certain emotion. 'For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when surprised...' (D'Alto paragraph 3); students can study their muscles that make their emotions by learning about these muscles.

In paragraph 9, it states '...Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them'. Just by making faces and using this technology, students can learn so so much more about their emotions on a deep level that can help in many ways. It would benefit students, teachers, therapists, and more.

In conclusion, this device and technology can help many different people in many ways. Students can learn about their facial muslces, therapists can help their clients learn to identify what emotions they are feeling, parents can hep understand how their children are feeling, etc etc. Students can even help one another feel better in small classroom situatioins all together.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
466692F9C4B9,"The Value of Students Emotions

I'm going to be talking about the technology that is able to read the emotional expressions on peoples faces. I don't think it's important for them to get that technology in class rooms. I'm going to be listing off ideas on why I think its not important for schools to get this technology. My first topic is going to be about how teachers are really interested in how the students feel about what they are learing. My second topic is going to be about how students usually give there opion on how they feel about there learning. My third topic is going to be about how they could use the money for something else other than that technology.

My first topic is teachers don't really care about how students feel about what are learning. What I mean by that is teachers don't care if the students like the topic are they just care about if the students are learning and understanding. Sometimes teachers can tell by students faces if they're liking the topic or not. Sometimes teacher will ask the students if they like the topic or not but they don't really care if they do. So then like what's the point in spending money on something like that.

Usually students will give their opion on the topic. I know I give my opion and I know other students to do to. Students don't want their faces to be scanned and told how they are feeling. I know I wouldn't want mine scanned. Everybody knows how they feel at school even teachers know how students feel at school. Sometimes teachers will ask the students how they feel at school and people will tell them the truth.

Schools could use the money for something else other than a face scanner. They could use the money for things that need fixed in the school. Like the roof it's been leeking they could fix that. Buy new things for the P.E. classes like balls or rackets. They could use the money to fix the cafetiera or buy new books with the money. They could spend the money on fixing the bathrooms or the lockers things like that is what they could spend there money on.

This is why I think they should not buy the scanner. I know it sounds cool and everything but I think it would not be a good idea to buy. It would be very awkward to up to a students face and just scan it during class. People won't like that I know I won't like that. It would also be a waste of time because what if just stopped working you would have to fix it or it stopped working all the time it would take a long time to fix.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

The software can tell witch muscle is being used. That is how it know if its a fake smile or are a reall smile. This will tech the students a face muscle. It will help tham later on how to tell a reall smile or a fake smile.

Can the software upgrade? The students will proabley try to make it better. During the project they will learn stuff about the software. Later they will know what to do if it breaks or when they will creat a software.

FF762DF8E150,"Everyone in the world makes different facial expressions everday. It's not necessarily something people try to do, but it is a natural way to express emotion. New technology called Facial Action Coding System allows doctors and scientists to evaluate people's facial expressions as a way of telling how they are feeling. Administrators should use the Facial Action Coding System in the classroom because it is valuable in ways such as engaging students in lessons, being able to tell if a student is experiencing negative emotions, and it will help students learn about facial expressions and what they mean.

One reason why the Facial Action Coding System would be valuable in the classroom is because it would keep students engaged in lessons. In the article, it says that the computer program would have the ability to see when a student is getting bored or confused. Once it recognized this, it would reengage them in the lesson. This is the same things teachers do, but if a teacher was busy with another student, the computer just completed the task for them. This would be an effective way for students to continue their learning in an innovative way.

Another reason the Facial Action Coding System would be useful in the classroom would be that the technology would be able to tell if the student was experiencing negative emotions. If someone knows their friend well, they are likely going to notice if they seem sad or downtrodden. However, if their friend is trying to hide their emotions, they might not even know something is wrong. On the other hand, if the computer systems were in the classroom, it would be able to tell if their were other negative emotions hidden from the human eye such as depression. This is evident from the article when it says that the Mona Lisa painting is, ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry""(D'Alto). These results could be surprising to some because to the normal human eye the Mona Lisa seems completely happy and few would guess she's actually angry or fearful. So, this would help administators know if there was emotionally something they could do to help their students.

The final reason the Facial Action Coding System should be used in classrooms is because it could teach students about recognizing facial expressions in people and what they mean. So, the technology is not only useful because it helps the students' emotional health, but also because it could help students help each other. If students learn how the computer tells how people are feeling, and they do the same, then the students will be able to recognize emotions and attain help for people they might think need emotional support. This would go above what humans are able to tell about how people feel on a regualar basis.

So, the

Facial Action Coding System would be useful in classrooms for a plethora of reasons. For one, it would recgonize if students were straying away from the lesson, and it would pull them back in. Also, the technology would be able to detect negative emotions within a student which could be presented to the teacher so they could help the student. Finally, the technology would be able to inform students on how to recognize emotions of people and could teach them all of the science and technological aspects of the sofware. This innovative facial technology could help students a trememdous amount in the classroom.    ",6,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,1.0
43FDEB1E411C,"What if there was a way to tell teacher's if student's are sad, mad, happy by using a computer. Something that will tell teachers if that student is confused on what is being taught.

Teens now of days hide their emotion's from parent's ,teachers, friends, anybody that's close to them. You won't know how that child feel's. Holding their emotions in, can cause problems in the classroom. Student's will lose focus on what's going on the class, thinking about thing's on their mind's.

The lastest software innovation from Prof. Huang can tell you if someone is mad, sad, or happy. All the computer need's is a 3-D computer model of that person face. Having this kind of technology to read expressions can be good in a classrooms. It'll tell teacher if that student is confused or bored. This type of technology will also tell if students are happy, mad, or sad. Teachers can confront students by asking if their okay, what part of the lesson in confusing to them.

Using this techology more kids will get good grade, even more kids will gradute. Students will be able to get work done because of teacher asking if their okay or what they don't get about what's being taught.              ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
0FDE661EB51E,"Emotions and being able to recognize them when they occur have a lot to do with our human ability to learn and pick up information. if perhaps, one is feeling confused, it would be much harder for them to be able to retain information being thrown at them. we see this a lot in the educational environment. At school, students must be attentive and ready to learn before they are actually able to start the process of learning. This goes hand-in-hand with the idea that schools, as well as the education system shoud pay more attention to students' emotions towards subjects, contrasting enthusiasm to pick up a new idea with boredom followed by inability to focus. This being said, the new software being used to detect emotion from facial expressions could be a rather helpful tool in the everyday classroom for years to come.

Every student has a different set of feelings, all are complex creatures with opinions on subjects that could differentiate them from one another. Some are better at learning subjects they are more interested in while others have the ability to devote time into learning any subject that school has to throw at them. The point remaining is that none are the same and so, teaching methods for students should become more indivualized to fit each students unique learning style and ability. It is possible that the computerized Facial Action Coding System could aid in the process of making these learning styles more fit for each student rather than just having them for the masses. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts, 'then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Having a computer monitor to read emotions from facial expressions could display to teachers how each student reacts to the information that they are learning, allowing teachers to make adjustmants in their teaching styles where they see fit. This could give students the ability to learn more effectively for their feelings towards subjects as they are personalized based on reaction as they continue.

The Facial Acting Coding System is a very complex process consisting not only of computer scientists but also of a team of psychologists using expertise to read peoples' emotions through their faces, using scientific evidence along the way. This could mean that, while it is a newer system, it is a well-proven one, making the classroom a good place to continue perfecting it. ""The facial expression for each emotion are universal,' observes Dr. Huang, 'even though individuals ofren show varying degrees of expression' (like not smiling as broadly). Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Monda Lisa. By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions (as in Davinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."" This line from the informative piece displays the process of determining emotions through computer technologies. It shows that it is well-tested and understood by its administrators as well as those in support of it, gaining it credibility as a method tested and used. this means that, while it is a newer technology, it could be used in the classrooms to continue to perfect the software by gaining more facial expressions from students, making it even more effective for its participants.

While the software detecting facial expressions is a good idea for countless reasons, it also has a few downfalls. One disadvantage of this technology could be its lack of other uses besides reading emotions of students as far as classrooms go. Some may argue that installation of this likely pricey software would not be worth the pay or the hassle of overall installation. To this, one could argue that allowing students to have a more personalized appraoch to learning should be enough to convince those against it that it is worthwhile. Students being able to learn in an environment as well as manner specifically tailored to their indivual learning abilities and styles will benefit us as a society not only in the future, as today's current students become tomorrow's important business officials and doctors, but also currently, as these students will have less stress devoted to worrying about trying to learn something they are disinterested in or simply don't understand. Altogether, the good outweigh the bad in this current argument.

Computerized sytems used to understand and display human emotions do belong in today's classroom. The benefits of this approach are numerous for both teachers and students being effected as well as for the future when these students are more outspoken, functioning members of society. This can be displayed that, not only would these systems help students to become more able and excited to learn in their own way, but it would also allow teachers to more effectively complete their jobs by editing approaches to learning to fit each student's individual syle and ability. It is also a well-understood and well backed-up process with scientific study allowing direct research to show its credibiltiy. Having students using this technologuy could also allow for the technology to become more credible as more emotions of individuals are entered into the technology. Finally, the price of these systems would not matter in the long-run as this would be money invested into the future of society as these students grow with a solid, quality education. Altogether, the good outweigh all the downfalls in this experiment and it should be introduced into classrooms in the following years to improve the quality of education.

46EB864A3362,"Facial Action Coding Sytems: Good or Bad?

People have bad days at school, whether it is from a home sitaution or just a bad grade. Being upset in school can affect your ability to preform well. This is why it is important for schools to have a Facial Action Coding System.

One reason why there should be Facial Action Coding Systems in schools is because it would help recongnize when the students emotion is low, faster so it would not affect their grade. For example, in the passage it says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson."" This proves that if the student can become more engaged then they will do better in school.

Another reason why there should be Facial Action Coding Sytems in schools is because it can give more insight into the student's home life. For example, if the student is having family problems you would be able to read it on their face with the coding system more quickly than through a human's eyes. Being sad could affect a student's scores and plummet their grade.

Finally, it would be smart and affective to have a Facial Action Coding System in the schools becuase it involves intense algorithims that kids could try and solve and maybe build one themselves. The system would promote science, technology, engineerng and math, which is very important. In the passage it talks about the types of algorithims Dr. Huang uses, ""His new computer software stores similar anatomical inforamtion as electronic code."" The coding Dr. Huang uses can be taught to students in order to further techonlogy in the world.

However, having a Facial Action Coding System could be a bad idea because it would not give student's the kind of action and discpline they would have with a human teacher. It is important for student's to build a bond with a teacher and to be able to open up to them. In the case with a Facial Action Coding System in the classroom the student's would not be able to have that bond.

In conclusion, it would be very benificial for Facial Action Coding Systems to be put in schools. They could help improve grades and give a better insight into problems a student may possibly be going through. It is very important to be able to read a student's emotion to help them academically. Everybody should push for Facial Action Coding Sytems to be installed in schools.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

If the kid wants it to be private or can't tell anyone anything then they don't want others to know at all. If they are mad they shouldn't take it out on someone else. They could maybe ask a close friend or teacher or parent for help or ask them what they should do. He or she could be going through a lot at home or with grades or a bully that makes he or she mad. Parents need to ask there kids and wonder are they doing ok in school is everything alright if there kid is showing emotions for being mad or sad then they should be concerned.

8F4907E2D511,"I am against this topic. I am against this topic, because I think it will distract the students. I say this, because they will be trying to change their emotiones to get diffrent things. I think it violates their privacy and other things. Now days it tis not hard to hack into a computor and take pictures of the person on the other side.

This FACS thing will probaly encourage the person to hack into a computor and change the pop ups or the emotions based of the other persons emotions. It could lead to people making the computor say special things to make a person happy about themselves, but it could lead to them talking the other person to meet them outside school. What is your thoughts?

I am strongly against this topic, because if I was a parent I would not want my kid using this product. I say this, because there are a lot of creepy, crazy, and a stalker. It could be used to lead the child to do a surtain thing. The pop ups chould lead the child to see or do bad things. The pop up could be changed by a hacker if they want. They could tell them to do drugs or drink under age. This is all bad for a kid. I would never want my kid to do any of that if I was a parent. I would never want my kid if they were old enough to drive and get drawn into drinking by a pop up ad and then kill someone, because they where drinking and driving.

Another reason I am against this is for the teachers side of things. Say you where a teacher and had FACS on the computor and all your students where changing their emotions to get diffrent pop ups. There your students are destracted and are not listening to your lecture or lesson for the day. Then you have to stop class and get onto the students. Then you may have a kid tell his mom or dad you yelled and told the class to stop goofing around. With their emotions. Then they call the school and you then have to go to a meeting about what happened. Then you will have to try not to get into trouble by the state or you head leader. This could cause a lot of disruptions in the class and they will not get the education that they are there for. I am not saying that there is not already a lot of destractions alreadyby phones, talking, and chromebooks. It is not going to be as bad as emotion based pop ups.

For the muscle and painting part of the passage. I think it had no relavents to the main idea of emotion based pop ups. Back then when the Mona Lisa was painted they didn't have computors or advanced technology. It could of been stated a little bit diffrent. Like"" Mona Lisa never rarly smiled, but now as technology advanced and we now know that muscles change our facial emotions.""

It then could help the scientific side of the FACS. Like now we know that your muscles help you change facial emotions. This then could help us then have more emotion based pop ups. This may sound like I am for they FACS, but I not for it. It is a vilation of privacy. What if the kid is having very bad thought like death or harm. Which is a very bad thing in teens today. This could lead to those bad pop ups again.

All in all I thing this FACS should be outlawed in the U.S. and other countrys. I thing it could be used in a bad way. If I was a parent I would never ever let my kid use this FACS. I thing it coul sway my kids thinging and ideas. Also it would affect why they are at school. I sent them to school for an education, so they can get a could job. If I was a parent I would never want to see my kid on the crime life.

2D1714712949,"Using the facial action coding system is useful for students and is valuable in the classroom. It is better for humans and for computers to communicate. The author uses technology, facial expressions and students. To prove why students need facial action coding systems in classrooms.

First the begin with talking about the technological side of it .In paragraph 1 they being to to talk about what the mona lisa was actually expressing through her facial expression by using FACS ( faical action coding system). The mona lisa is one of the most famous and staple pieces of art. Their have been many debates on if the mona lisa was happy and using this technology proved she was 83% happy. They used FACS to figure out her emotions from that exact moment. in paragraph 2 they begin to talk about the use of the FACS computer. How they use it to figure emotions for intance the mona lisa's emotion. The process isnt that hard use stand in front the computer and make facial expressions and the computer can figure it out for you.

Secondly they being to talk about facial expression. In paragraph 4 Dr. Huang talks about how facial expressions are universal. facial expressions are truly universal it is key on figuring out how others around you could be feeling. In paragraph 5 they talk about how humans come with an impressive calculation to what people may be feeling such as friend and how we can tell the difference between each emotion. Humans come with bein able to understand human emotions through expressions but not always seeing as people can mask true emotions for instance at one point he beings to talk about different smile and which is real and which is fake.

Lastly he beings to talk about how it would be useful in a classroom enviroment. In paragraph 6 they talk about how if a student is using a computer and the computer has FACS ( facial action coding systems) that it will being to recognize if a student is confused and bored and will able to modify the lesson for the student to regain interest in the lesson. The student will be A able to pass his or hers class and B have fun and be interested while doing it. In paragraph 9 they talk about how it help a theater teacher and his actor ( his students) to be able to udnderstand the theory of emotions. Emotions are always around and may work in your favor from you getting a good grade to putting on a great performance FACS will be able to help to do that.

In conclusion FACS seems to be very useful from the class room to the stage FACS can be used for being able to fully understand somebody's emotions all by looking at their face .The author used technology , facial expressions , and students to do that .",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
ADFF10967768,"When new technology comes out it can always be a positive thing. That its better to have something than not to have it. having a computer that can determine if we are sad, happy, bored, etc. is pretty crazy. without this technology we probably wouldnt be able to determine that the Mona Lisa is prodomitly happy. That a computer can do something that humans do everyday when we look at someone.

That having the ability of computers that can read students faces, in my opinion is valuable and can be used in many ways.

There are many ways that the computer can be used, if someone were to put the computer in a everyday public school classroom. They can detect and figure out what learning style kids like. this can be implimented and put to use in classrooms around the world and help get kids more into school and want to try to get an education. This can make school more fun and more intresting for kids today. differetn classrooms can have different styles and you have a variety of kids per classroom and test to see what style the kids like. when the results come back teachers and staff can go over them and the more majority of kids that like a certian teaching style can be the style that is implimeanted in the schools today This is all done by seeing what facial emotions are used by the kids.

Another way that the ability of reading students emotions can help, is to have the ability detect how students are feeling and even when they are trying to hide how they are feeling. When you are a teenager you have lots of crazy and mixed feelings. Sometimes a student might go into a deep depression and his or her friends might not be able to detect the the fact of what they are feeling and they might do something to themselves that might not be a good thing. If you use this device and cna detect how they are feeling you could stop that student from harming his or her self from doing this. This can save lots of lives and stop death rates all around the world and help that student to get help and stop this from happening. This is all done from a technology that can read facial emotions and can be very useful and even save ones life.

Having this technology can be nice, but sometimes it cant always be right. If we use this technology it doesnt always mean that it can be helpful or can detect what really kids are thinking. Sometimes you can put on a brave face and show the world what really inside thats not what you are thinking. The computer migh pick up the brave face you are showing and say that you are happy but really you are having a bad day and you really arent happy. When you use this technology for schools and the computer detects the faces wrong then you have spent all of this money to have the computers detect how the faces of the kids are showing and the results really arent true then you have just wasted lots of time and that is not necessary to have. We dont really know what people are feeling. Mona lisa may not be 83 percent happy and 9 percent disgusted, etc. She may be 10 percent happy and 90 percent digusted, etc. there no good way to determine what she was really feeling at that time and in that picture.

Having the technology to read students emotional expressions can be helpful, but it determines how you use it and how you correct the results are. But having this technology isnt a bad thing. Its a way to determine what people are thinking without asking the person or being in that persons head. But with having technology that is able to read students faces and emotional expressions can be used and if used carefuly can help schools and other people today.

This article of ''Making Mona Lisa Smile'' it talks about how a computer seastem can raed student emotional expressions such a Mona lisa emotion.

This sieastem can recognize emotions whether you're angry, happy, surprise, disgust, fearles and ect. This process begins when the computer constrac a 3-D computer model of the face. all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Action unit are movement of one ore more muscle. Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman wich are the creators of FACS.

Dr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions; happines, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle, above your eyes, reased your eyebrows whe you surprise also your orbicularis around your mouth, and tightens your lips to sho anger. This example we can se it in the firts pharaghaph when it talks when shes 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and r percent angry.

Becaue I wouldn't like for my classmates to know what im feeling or my emotions at that time, that sounds pretty personal to me and I think thats giving to much information to your classmates. I mean I'm not saying its a bad thing for your classmates to know your emotions, but I honestly wouldnt like it.

Not only do I think its some what personal but it do sound pretty intersting at the same time. Like I think its cool that the teacher would know when you start feeling that the class is boring and the teacher can do somethung different and make it fun or change the way that he's teaching and do something else. Like that sounds pretty awesome, but other hen that I wouldn't like havving this type of system in my classroom.

Honestly having this system in my classroom its like a 50/50 percent because it sounds cool and everything, but at the sametime I don't like it because I wouldn't want my classmates knowing what I'm at that in the class because I don't people knowing my business only the people I truly trust.

This sytem has six basic emotions that it will be able to recognize from your facial expression. While some may think that this may not be a helpful system, this could help many others with their studies in school and others just in general to know what they may like or how they are feeling.

This system may not be totally reliable in the beginning of the process but by the time the bugs have been delt with and the researchers have maade sure that the system is precessing to the best of its ability this could potentially become the most helpful system in helping others in school and even outside of their schooling work. ""'A class room computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts."" Many may think that this machine could cause problems with teaching but the upside is that this would be able to detect what the student may be strugglung with that the teacher may not know how to handle what they may not be getting.

Every student in school struggles with something that they may have been taught from English, science, to math all of these have at least one student that may have a harder time learning how to solve problems, write essay's, and even make certain reactions happen in science but with this system students may learn faster or at least it would help them learn in a way that they could understand. ""'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" If this could help students in school with what they are learning and help them understand it better image what could be done with this with a more advanced system.

The better reseachers can make the system the more it will be able to do. This could help disabled people with learning or even make them happier. If the Facial Action Code System can help students in school with understanding certain elements of what is being taught, this could ultimently help disabled kids and even teachers to know the best way to handle what the kids understand and what they don't. The teacher may doing what they can to help diabled children and even adults but these people work slower that normal people do and with this teacher can find out the best way that disabled children or adults can learn.

Is the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom valuble? The technology is valuable, because it can tell if you are confused or bored, and change what you are doing to something that is either easier to understand or more entertaining to learn. That is something valuable, becuase not only does it help students, but it also helps teachers teach the kids.

How could a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel? Well, "" The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Movement of one or more muscles is called and 'action unit.' "". "" For example, your frontalis par lateralis mucles (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."". This is really useful also because, the computer can tell if your sad or happy. "" Imagine a comptuer that knows when you're happy or sad. For examples, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."".

"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'. The same technology can make computer- animated faces more expressive--for video games or video sugery. 'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,' notes Dr. Haung. 'So computers need to understand that, too.'"". That is valuable, it helps students and teachers, by just recognizing our facial expressions. It would make it easier for the special needs kids too, because instead of teachers having to change their lessons a hundred different times. The computer would change it as soon as it reads the kids expression that he didn't understand.

Is this Technology to read the emotinal expressions of students in a classroom valuable? Yes, this technology is very valuable, for someone who don't understand things so easily this would help extremendisly. For the shy kid who is confused but don't want to ask for help. Or the mean boy who wants good grades but don't want to ask for help because his buddies might make fun of him. Even for the smartest person in class, it would help.

20D57DEC3EF5,"I think using a Facial Action Coding Systemin the classroom to identify the emotions of students is not okay, Why? becuase some people want to express themselves of their feelings that has been done by others.

But for some people painting portraits can help them express their feelings through painting. Sometimes people express their emotions through music by singing or making music. Then in the Mona Lisa, no one knows what feeling she is expressing and what is she feeling. For instance, some artists say she is happy but no one really knows what emotion she is feeling. In conclusion, I think classrooms shouldn't use Facial Action Coding System to identify the expression of students an how they are feeling. But some people have hidden talents that they use to express themselves or their emotions. Also not many people icluding students express themselves through painting some use dancing, acting, making music, singing, cooking and their are many ways of expressing your emotions through many things.

B3C454E2E3E0,"Reading someones facial expression may be effective sometimes but that does not mean that they are actually feeling a certain emotion like anger and confusion for example, but they could be feeling extremely happy. In the article, the author stated that Dr. Huang used a picture of Mona Lisa to test the new emotion-recognition software but the software may not be effective because they tested it on a painted photo and not a real living person. Also, da Vinci could have exagerrated Mona Lisas facial expression for the sake of the painting so they may not be accurate.

Using this software in a classroom may not be effective because if a student is making a certain face that does not mean that they are bored or confused, it could just be how their face naturally looks. The software can also mis read their face and even glitch. The use of this program would require the use of a camera through the computer and that is not always safe. Hackers could be trying to hack their computer and steal personal information from the person or even their identity.

In conclusion, this software is not valuable for classroom use because students have other things that they need other then a facial coding system. If the student knows that the camera is active then that could even become a distraction to them so they use of this software is not needed.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

But what would happen is technology shuts down one day or even a month? People who depend on technology will be forlorn.

In relation to the arcticle and the question about technology shuting down, if we use this technolgy called Facial Action Coding System in students to read emotional expressions of students in a classroom, we can have advantage when it comes to understanding and helping the students.

Maybe detecting people's emotions can help the government or they would be the only ones to get a benefit from it, so they can control easily the citizens.

We will be talking about what this technology could leade to, what it may mean for schools, and how positive it may be.

Now this technology is quite advanced but, could it be a little far? Personally i feel this technology could be something positive in our lives but it could leade to many bad things. People will start relying on their computer to make them happy, people who have loved ones may just use a computer to read their emotions rather than actually trying to figure it out.

Schools are always trying to keep students happy, or willing to learn. But they seem to always lose their interest, so maybe it will help classes and maybe help advance students to a better grade or maybe even get them somewhere were they feel intrigued in. It could also help for the fact of students who are angry, helping them relax or putting them in a different situation.

This technology is very positive but still has its down sides. In my eyes, I see this as something negative for the fact being that humans need to try and reach someones heart and know them. We cant have technology just tell you if someone is happy or if they upset. You wouldnt really get any experience in social skills.

BAAC43CEFCEE,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."" the auhtor explains the development in new technology called the Facial Action Coding System that enables coputers to detect human emotions. As humans do this almost everyday attempting to figure out the mood of the people in their surroudnings.

Computer technology is now able to do the same actions but on a higher level inclduing percentage and specific musclesthat induce the face of happiness and other emotions. This technology in a classroom reading the emotional expressions of students would be very valuable becuase teachers can adjust the lesson accordingly, they can help them and try to relate the lesson to them, and they could act differently according to the person's mood.

The first reason why this technology would be useful in a classroom is so the teachers can adjust the lesson accordingly. For example, if a teacher had planned to talk about Romeo and Juliet which is a morrid tradegy inclduing death, they could switch the lesson and avoid conflict if they knew a student was sad and possibly had a death in their family or relations. If the tecaher had gone into the lesson talking about the death and such upsetting events they could have upset the student and made issues. Another example would be if the teacher saw the student was not understanding the material they could explain the lesson in a different way. One of the main reasons for schooling is to learn and this could help teachers teach their students more efficently. The teacher would know if a student was confused and they could provide them assitance.

The second reason this technology would be useful in a classroom is so that the teacher could try and relate their lesson to the studnets so they understand it better. For example, recently children are very drawn to technology. If students in an english class were reading a book and their homework was writing a summary over each chapter some wouldn't complete it becuase it's 'hard' or 'boring'. If you flip the perspective and have a class twitter page and the students would tweet each day something about what they read they would take to it better. A teacher could see that a student is very happy they do do a lesson that is along the lines of knowing what happiness is and explaining emotions. If a teacher tried to do a lesson like that while their students were sad they could most likely not explain happiness.

The third reason this technology would be useful in a classroom is so that the teacher could act differently according to the person's mood. If a teacher was planning on having a debate in class but then realized that some of their students were already angry and flustered they might change the plan. The students would go into the debate angry and it would only make them angrier resulting in the class getting out of control or hurting a student's feelings. If a student comes in and the teacher notices they are sad and upset they won't be as harsh on them. If the said student had a missing assingment that had to be turned in the teacher could wait until the next day or aproach them in a kind and understanding manner. If the teacher hassaled the student about a missing assingment when already upset it could escalate the situation to an uneeded extent.

Many people focus on their emotions and feelings, teenagers at a higher level than most. People are led to act on how they feel about the situation or in general. Emotions lead the world and without them it would be a boring and grimy place to live. In many situations multiple peoples feelings get hurt becuase they say something to a person in a bad mood and the person explodes on them. School inhabits alot of stress onto teenagers so if thier teacher knew how they felt it could help them all. This technology in a classroom reading the emotional expressions of students would be very valuable becuase the teachers can adjust the lesson accordingly, they can help and try to relate the lesson to them, and they could act differently according to a person's mood. Emotions are a large part of a tenneagers life and if schools could help reduce stress, help students comprehend, and help rather and hurt the students emotions the school systems could have a largely more postive impact.

39E92B8A058B,"In the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile."", the author discusses the idea of using Facial Action Coding Systems in a classroom. The Facial Action Coding System is a software that allows computers to read expressions of faces. For example, this program was able to detect that the Mona Lisa was, ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" ( D'Alto 1-2) This technology could have a great impact on children in school. Putting computers with Facial Action Coding System in classrooms, in order to help read student's emotions and make the lesson more appealing to them, is a good idea.

The Facial Action Coding System would be very beneficial in classrooms. In most classrooms now, there are 20-30 students and only one teacher. This is a great responsiblity for a teacher to take on. With computers as help, learning in a classroom could be much more affective. Dr Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like and effective human instructor."" Many children in classrooms can fall behind without one on one time with a teacher. However since classrooms are so big, it becomes less likely that a child who wants help actually gets the attention they need. With computers like these in classrooms, kids who need a little extra could get the practice without a teacher.

Although this technology could be life changing in many ways, it has its flaws. For example, we are still a long ways from being able to put these computers in every classroom. Also, the cost of this techonology is unknown. This could add to extra fees famlies have to pay when sending their child to school, some of which may not be ablee pay for this type of computer system. Even if the cost of these computers were low and they were able to be in every classroom, would they work properly all the time? Technology is not perfect and if the Facial Action Coding System is unrelable, then are they really worth the money?

Yes, these computers are worth the money. Despite all the possiblities that could go wrong with this technology, they still have great potential. Children would be getting a better education. Some students are ahead of others, and need more of a challenge. The Facial Action Coding System can help those who seem bored in class, which gives the children the oppertunity to learn more in a regular classroom setting. It also makes everyone in the classroom equal. While everyone is on the computer, it doesn't seperate those who need help from those who do. This will boost children's confidence and teach them to like school more while getting a better education at the same time.

There are several benefits to putting the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms in order to help read student's emotions and make the lesson more appealing. This system can help provide more challenging material and a oppertunity to learn more for the students who need it. It can also provide more help and extra lessons for the students who are behind in class. Overall, the Facial Action Coding System would help out teachers who have big classes. It would provide more one on one time for all students which would boost the rate they learn at, proving it is a good idea to have these types of computer systems in a classroom.

because, it would help with alot of different things going on in school. Like for example it could tell what kind of mood the student is in so the teacher could know how to approch them wihtout the student "" going off."" This would even help with knowing if the student gets the lesson the teacher is teaching by thier facial expressions.

Like i said it helps with alot of differnt things, the author says, "" hold on, can we acually ""calculate"" emotions."" yes we can, its a ""smart computer"" & its like a person. I say its like a person because, say you see your friend and he/she has a frown on her/his face. You auctmactly know theres something wrong because he/shes frowning & thats also what the computer is bacislly doing.

43E8315FA921,"so i guess this paragraph is going to be about technology and stuff which is cool after all i do plan to be the greatest actor in the world someday so im pretty much have to know about technology eventually. however as of right now its kind of irrelevant well lets not say that i'll say more in the lines or confusing if so to speak like first of all its a painting who cares how she was feeling you know. i got of topic basically the real question is is the technology used to recognize emotions valuable or not. luckly for you guys i have an opinion which may or may not be ignorant or not but as for your question ill answer it in about 3 paragraphs. but for now before i begin i will say it will certainly change our world as we know it for the better let me tell you why.

now according to the paragraph the machine is supposed to use a 3d computer to model all 44 facial muscles which is called a action unit by using the 6 classified main emotions. which are happiness'fear'surprise'anger'discust'fear'and sadness all of which we all humans feel on a regular basis. i know it seems kind of weird but you know it could actually be useful in the near future like we may be able to use it for interrogation for criminals. the other thing we could do with it is if we evolve as a race we could upgrade our tchnology and be able to detect moods instead of emotions mind blown right i think the future will be pretty cool. the future will be cool because if we were to actually pull that off we could understand each other better this paragraph is about how the facial action coding system can help us in the future. i think it is valuable for crime uses science stuff basically for all proffesions you could even use it for day to day life or for rehab or something i definitely think they should make a mood changer to enhance it.

but as for the emotions i think its just neat and a cool thing to do like in my opinion unless you upgrade it to a mood sensor it's kind of useless and boring and basicaly not valuable. but dont listen to me this is coming from a f foot 10 16 year old so by all means dont let me discourage you i say if you want to do it go for it. i really dont see the use tin class to be honest its more like a toy than a machine i guss its cool for museums to see paintings but thats just my opinion.

What something people don't know is the painting of the woman actually shows different emotions by moving parts of her face. For many decades, people from all over the world are attracted and have experienced the same thing. Years later, a group of scientists named Dr. Huang and Professor Nicu Sebe started to calculate human facial movements by computer. They wanted to show how people feel back in the past decades. In addition, what people call the artwork Mona Lisa ""the only moving picture ever existed."" No matter where you are, no matter where you stand, Mona Lisa can still stare at you. No one knows what make the human parts move.

25C32F08C197,"Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time. His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state. On of his most well known paintings is the ""Mona Lisa"". The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features. She doesn't really look happy or sad. This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created. This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling. It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion. This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom. The use of this technology to read the expressions of students in a learning envionement can help students learn more efffectivly by allowing for immediate feedback from a student allowing for the quick shift of a lesson plan, and being able to help and support students emotionally.

This technology can help get immediate feedback from students. In almost all class rooms nation wide there is a similar routine. Learn something, practice it for homework and then see if a student is understanding it by taking a quiz over it. While this may be effective, it can be imporved ten fold with the Facial Action Coding System. The technology could understand emotion of students in present time. A teacher wouldn't have to wait to give out a quiz to see if students were having issues. They could teach the subject and then immediatly know if students are having difficulty unerstanding it. Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". If teachers are able to recieve this information, their teaching would become more effective. Teachers could change lesson plans in order to fit the needs of the students, and give extra support and help to those children that are still struggling. FACS can also help excite studnets about learning. This is important because no matter how much a teacher trys to help a student, the studnet will not imporve in anything if thet do not want to learn. If computers are able to read if studnets are excited or bored by a lesson, teachers would add visuals and what not to make it more intersesting to a student. This would make them want to learn, not them being required to learn. totality, the ability to be able to percieve students emotions would help students academically by allowing teachers to change lesson plans that allow for more excitment and understand in classrooms.

To continue, the FACS technology would help students be more emotionally stable. While school is a vaulable place to learn new information and facts, it is really a place for children to grow and become more independent and better human beings. While grades matter, the emotional and pyschological health of a student is far more valuable. The FACS technology could act as an army of school counselers. High School and Middle School students tend not to share their emotions, even with their parents. FACS could idntify students that are emotionally troubled, have depression, contemplate self harm or even have mental illness. Once students like these are identified then counselers and social workers could step in, allowing for students to be helped. Right now students that struggle with these issues do not share their feelings. They do not get help and carry on like they are fine. While many may turn out to be okay, even one taking their own life or somebody's else, is too much. While FACS may not be able to help or eliminate all signs of emotional distress, it can surely make a difference. Another benfit of using FACS is that it reads emotoins silently. Students don't have to potray a certain emotion for the technology to understand what they are really feeling. If a studnet is asked how they are, they probably give a surface level, I am fine, answer. The technology reads through that completely, eliminating awkard one on one conversatoins with conselers, and allowing for all students to be reached.

While there are many positives to this technology some might argue that computers cannot actually calculate human emotion. They argue that human emotion is not somehting that can or should be understood because it would ruin the entirety of feeling certain ways. However, while some arguements may be warranted, many are based off of falsehoods. To begin, emotion can be understood on a scientific level. Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.

In conclusion, the ability to read the actual emotion and reactions of students in class rooms is extremely valuable because it allows for greater understanding and excitment of a subject, along with the ability to help students be emotionally stable. If this technology is implemented into schools, studnets will overall do better, feel better and make a brighter world for tomorrow. FACS is something revolutionary that hopefully all of us can learn somthing from.",6,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,1.0

A student could havea look on his or her face and the computer could read the wrong emotion of them. There is always that chance it could not work. Sometimes people can´t always tell is someone is smiling or not, maybe that could happen to the computer.

It might be usless in the classroom on students because Dr. huang said you cant wlays tell the full trait of happy. The computer might not be able to tell the whole trait of any emotion. It could tell you a emotion about your face maybe that you are feeling and could be completeing wrong. Some people might just have a blank experrsion on the face and have no emotion, or maybe they have a little emotion that the computer can´t see. There are 44 muscles in the model that must move like human muscles. Dr huang says this could modify lessons if the student is confused, but what if the machiene makes the lesson even more confsuing that what it really was.

The Mona lisa demonstration really intended to bring a smile to your face this while just imagine how a computer knows when you're happy or sad thats crazy. For example, if you smile as soon as a web ad appears on the screen another ad will follow. Lets say that you frown the next ad will be different from the one you smiled on. Another thing a classroom computer can know when students are becoming to be confused or bored.

How the start of the porcess is when the computer contracts a 3-D computer model of the face all of the 44 major muscles on the model must have move like human muscles. Eckamn has classified six emotions for example anger, surprise, fear, sadness and happiness. Movement for more than one muscle is called a unit.

For example, you could tell how your friend is feeling by looking at his or her face. most us would have trouble describing each others facial trit that makes us happy or worried. Yet Dr. Huang observes artist like Leonardo Da Vinci he studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles to have enough convey specific type of emoitions.

However the new technology is valuable by telling you how what are your human emotions. For example a classroom computer can show when a student is bored or getting confused.

B44F645BFD65,"Why We Shouldn't Use FACS Technology in Classroom

FACS technology shouldn't be used in classrooms, and there are several good reasons as to why. Some of the things that people value the most are their money, a good education, and privacy. Implementing FACS technology can disrupt all of these things that people value.

First of all, the author of this article, Nick D'Alto, never even mentions the cost of this technology. Seeing as this technology isn't even fully developed yet, it would presumably cost millions of dollars in research to even get a fully developed working product. When new technology comes out, it is usually more expensive then anything else on the market. A school is the last place that should be using its resources for an emotion reading system. Most schools are lacking funding and resources, which is leading to cuts in many music and athletic departments. Another pretty well known fact is that schools spend less money on cafeteria food then JAILS do. If a school is getting additonal funding these are the types of things that they should be spending it on, not useless emotion readers.

This goes into the second reason, which is effectiveness and practicality. How do we know that what this computer is saying is actually correct. Sometimes, there are some things that advanced technology just cannot solve. A computer may sense a sad or confused look on a student's face, but that doesn't necessarily tell you WHY they are sad or confused. Dr. Huang from the article says that based off of the look on your face, the computer could modify the lesson. First of all, if a teacher is teaching a lesson, it probably wouldn't want a computer modifying what he or she wants to do. A teacher shouldn't modify the whole lesson for the entire class, just because someone has a certain look on their face, for reasons that may not even be school related. Modifying a lesson for students who aren't even struggling could potentiall ruin the way they learn, and how quickly and effectively they learn and understand concepts. If a teacher senses that a certain student is confused or not paying attention, they could always talk to them after class and fix the problem, which is a much more effecient and effective way of doing it.

A third reason that this FACS technology shouldn't be implented is for privacy. While the author does list some useful applications for this technology, such as surgeries and video games, common computers for everday use is not where it should be used. One reason that people fear this advanced technology in their own computers is for privacy. Many students probably don't want a camera in their school laptops constantly scanning their faces to see what kind of emotions they have. Many students would see that as creepy and intrusive, and would probably complain to the adminstration to remove it.

People value many things in life, but some of the most important are their money, a good education, and and their privacy. Having this FACS technology in schools can ruin all of these things, which is why using this technology in a classroom is not valuable.          ",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8
D3743A053512,"Have you ever been upset, but not wanted anyone to know? Well having this type of technology exploits personal feelings without consent. It can be a valuable peice if used correctly. Overall though, I think we should keep this technology away from classrooms.

For starters, a persons feelings and emotions is his or her buisness. Giving a computer the option to read us like a book and evaluate us is something that just wouldn't make much difference. We are human beings, we have feelings and if we wanted someone else to know we would tell them. We show emotions how we see fit, it's just what we do.

A computer does not need to do that for us.

Secondly, every single human on this earth is different. How could one machine read every emotion? I know for sure that my happy face is not the exact same to another. My surprised face could by their happy face, and the opposite aswell. No two are alike in this world, they're will always be a biased factor in this technology. Which is why we cannot rely on technology everyday, some things are better face to face.

On the other hand, having this added onto a online school, or even on some online learning website could help. As it could change the lesson if it senses boredom or confusion. In paragraph 6, it states that exact message, Dr. Huang says ""A classroom computer could regongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Which in all ways could be a great addition, but if you take into consideration all the cons. That one pro just isn't enough. We have amazing teachers who have the same possibility to bring classroom joy, we don't need computers for that.

In Conclusion, this product is one that could potentially change the online world and maybe even schooling. If in the right environment though, we don't need it. We have an amazing staff in all schools working around the clock to make sure kids learn what they need to succeed in life.

In the begining paragraph 3 it explains that the process of FACS constructed by a 3-D model of the face and its 44 muscles. Being able to calculate and determine the facial muscles is vitial to the accuracy of this process. Lets say that a kid using a computer has down syndrome and his entire face is numb which has caused it to droup down substantually. How would the FACS process work then?

Lets say a student is having a bad day and doesnt want anyone to ask what is wrong; or how are you? Then that student gets the computer and puts a mask on.

Not only can this technology tell when a student is confused, it can also tell when they are bored. In the text Dr. Huang says ""Then it could modify the lesson"" which I totally agree with. A student is not going to tell a teacher that they are bored, but with this technology a teacher can still find out. Finding out that a student is bored is great because teachers can modify the lesson to make the students engaged. The students will have more fun being taught with a more engaged lesson, which will raise test scores. Some people may say have this technology in class is werid or creepy, but if they students, teachers, and parents do not have a problem with it there should not be a problem.

Secoundly, the Facial Action Coding System will work on anyone. In the artical it states ""the facial expresions for each emotion are universal"". This means that it does not matter who you are, or what you look like your results will be spot on. Since we all have the same muscles in our face, this technology will work on everybody. Not only that, but this sytstem is accurate. In the text it says ""she is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry."" It could have just said she is happy, because it is the highest percent, but this system goes into detail. It also has a psychologist that Dr. Huang relies on to make even more sure the results are accurate.

In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System should be in classrooms. It can help students get better learning experience, it works on everybody, and it is accurate. ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
477F24CDDE0B,"How would you feel if your teachers, councilers, and administraters could calculate your emotions electronicaly? There is now a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System, the process begins when the computers construts a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 muscules, but can only recongize humans; no animals. By having this 3-D model of ones face they can track all of the emotions you have while doing homework, learning a new leason, or taking a test. Once you are done the computer put the emotions into percentages and will show your teacher.

Concidering the fact that this will help teachers know whether a student is struggling and not understanding the material fully, this system would be a very valuable thing to have in the classroom. Even though you most likely ""calculate"" someones emotions everyday, such as a friend when they are sad; no one can tell exactly what everyone is thinking. Yet, Dr. Huang managed to get a computer to recongnize human emotions. One way he did this was by observeing how artists construct the face and how they can capture such strong emotions. Now that schools can have this new system, teachers won't need to try and figure out if anyone needs help. Everyone knows that when a teacher asks if anyone is struggling no one is going to raise their hand because the students are afraid to look dumb. The Facial Action Coding System will now make sure everyone is doing okay and that the leasons are understandable for every student in the classroom.

Although this system could be risky, a computer could see if a student was getting confused or bored and then modify the lesson, just like a teacher. This system might seem dangerous because some may think schools wont need teachers as much anymore, but we will still need teachers to keep classrooms under control. Classrooms will be most likely more under control because when a student gets bored they start to talk, but if the computer can change the leason to make them less bored, they won't talk as much. Yes, there still will be talking and messing around, but there will not be nearly as much. Assuming that there will be less drama and talking, do we really know if this system works acuretly on everyone?

Knowing that every person on Earth has a different face and shows different emotions, how do we know that it will work? What if someone squinting there eyes isn't confused it just helps them read better, then you change the leason and they are now confused because this does not make sense to them. Now the teacher is watching them and making sure they are doing well; when another student is actually confused, but the conputer does not reconginize it. This system may seem all well and good at first, but the more you think about it, the more danmage it could do.

New is always a good thing, but is this system too new too fast. Some students, parents, and/or teachers may not want to have this type of system in their classroom or childrens classroom. The Facial Action Coding System would be such a helpful system to have in schools, but the question is does it actually work as well as they say it does, and would people be okay with having it as a part of their schooling process?

812E55865DD4,"The technology to read the emotional epressions of students is very unecessary. i believe its unecessary because, that would be too much information to be giving a computer. a computure dont need to know students faces & emotions, its used for technology only.

The first reason why i say no because the computer already holds enough information about students like their full name, birthday, location & more. Students feelings & emotions shouldnt go on a computer. In the article, the author mentioned that the computer will study your face muscles too see if you are confused, happy, sad, etc. That would be holding too much information about a child or teen & you never know whats going on or whos waching behind tha computer screen.

Also, Its not a computers business on how a student is feelings. its a computer, not a person. its no llke the computer can do something about their emotions. Thats a teachers job with seeing how a student is feeling, not a compters.

Though it is a good idea to come up with, i will still disagree with this invention/idea. a computer should not have that much info on someone period. also, you never know who may be watching behind the computer screen.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
5503B0FB1886,"I dont think the use of the technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because, students should at least have the right to there own personal thoughts. Students are in a building all day with other students and teachers that they might not trust, like, or let alone even know. Students have no freedom in school, teachers make or tell students what to do everything is watched, students are constantly told what to do by adults that they dont know, let alone trust. So i think students should have the right to keep there personal thoughts, opinions, and emotional expressions as private as they want them to be. Unless you know the student is in danger that students personal thoughts, emotional expressions, and opinions should be kept as private as they wish until they are ready to talk about whatever the situation could have been.

435BB43F5D06,"I am for the value of using this technology to read people emotional expressions. A few reasons I am for this experiment is because you can see how people feelings are, if a person has a hard time showing/ expressing their emotions to others, and see how others feel about you or another person.

This experiment can contructn a 3D facial model on a computer and pop right out and see how that person is feeling. The computer can classifiy the six basic expressions on a person, such as happiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and saddness. Scienctist did a lab experiment on the famous Leonardo da Vinci's painting Mona Lisa. The experiment was to see if Mona was trying to smile or if she was being serious, so they experimented to see her expressions.

The technology associates with facial movements and mussles, that the computer can detected a false smile and a netural expression. The technology of the computer can detect if a person has a real smile or a forced smile on their face. A way to see if a person is forcing their smile is by looking at the sides of their mouth because the smile is stretched on the sides of your mouth using a different mussle, the risorius.

The theory of the experiment is not only tp show and figure out you expressions/ emotions but it can also help you with producing them. The whole story is talking about showing the emotions of your peers.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
C2F55629FA77,"Emotions may be hard to understand sometimes, but they are still vital in everyday life so that we as humans can communicate how we are feeling with each other. It is especially vital for teachers to know how their students are enjoying the lesson. With modern technology that can read emotions, teachers may be able to better understand their students, and create a lesson that is fun for everyone.

From an emotion test taken on the Mona Lisa, Professors Thomas Huang, and Nicu Sebe detected the lady's exact emotions based on what is portrayed in the painting. According to the technology, she is ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearfuk, and 2 percent angry."" This technology used on a classic Renaissance painting could be used in schools to help teachers better understand the students, and therefore help to make the class fun for every one. In the article it gives the example of a class room computer recognizing when a student is bored or confused, then modify the lesson to fit that person's personality.

All in all, this sort of technology that can read emotions would be helpful for schools because it could help students understand their school work better, and in turn help them do better in school. ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
E55AEC795109,"The technoligy I dont think will be able to read the expressions from the people in my classroom because i dont that there is such a technolighy like this because it sounds almost impossible to evr make something liike this because it was back then and back then there was not anyhting like this or even untill this day there is nothing like it

Then if there was ever something like this technoligy i dont think it will work very well considering that every one is in school and mostly when anybody is in school they are usually bummed out about being in school and i think the machine will read mixed emotions and the computer or the device will read everyones emotions wrongs because like they say id in the first paragragh how she had mixed emotions I think that that is pretty crazy to have for just one person because

I dnt think just one person can ever hve that many emotions even if was a cartoon or a painting

Lastly i dont think that everybody in my school will allow the emotion reader decide there amotions because like me I will not feel comfortable with one of those readers lie many other people in my classroom will be comfortable with that reader to decde or find out there emotions because the reader might get the wrong emotion and people might start making fun of other peoples emotions and there might be a big argument with the reader and somebody might get mad because that is not how they are feeling and people might get mad because the reader might say something about somebodys buisness and people might get embarassed about what other people might think about ther hidden emotions.

Some people may not even pay any mind to it and still get on there phone and many think wh is it a BIG problem. But are they lil computers? Do theg mess up your mood.

Right now in 2018 , we ave have so much technology that a comouter could tell us what mood we are in. But making that come ture would be GREAT.Knowing that a computes know if you are down and see a ad pop up or you get bored and it somehing for you to work on maybe kids would love to come to school just for that. Like if we needed help it would modify something for us to work on.

Would you think students would stay of there phones if thoese computers was active in school for us to use, Maybe ? Maybe not . why because some kids just does not like school at all . So they woudnt even care about the Ads popping up.

I think that the mood technology would work becuse it also helps with being sad and you may never know something could be going on at home and it effects how they are learning. Teahers may be busy so you really coulded tell them so before you start you work. There always something to help you cheer up.            ",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
