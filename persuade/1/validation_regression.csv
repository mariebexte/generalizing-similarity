C44A702C460F,"Technology is becoming more and more advanced as time passes by. The Facial Action Coding System is a program that can tell a users emotion by using a 3-D model of the users face. This new technology is a valuable piece of equiptment for a classroom. This can assist teachers create better lesson plans for the students. In addition, it will clear up the confusion over mixed emotions concercing the classroom.

This new technological innovation can help open the eyes of teachers. If a student is doing an assignment on the cmputer and is very confused the teacher may not know because he or she is busy working with another student. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...""(6). Then once the computer knows the student is confused or bored, it can change the lessson toconform to them. This will help teachers teach kids more effiecently without having to change all of their material to help one student.

This technology also has the ability to show the multiple different emotions of a person. ""...the software can even identify mixed emotions..."" (4). No more will a face be wrongly recongized as in understanding or agreeance. An educater can use this information to understand the overall ratios of his or her students. With this technology in classrooms there will not be a feeling of being left behind.

Less and less students will be confused in class leading to better test rates. Also modified tests and task due to the Facial Action Coding System will improve on the lerning material to highten knowledge. Knowing this, the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable in the classroom. ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
A56E412B7295,"Would the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom effect the wrok ethic or be a waste of money? There could be some good and bad about this new computer. What if some people don't like this new computer and it messes with their work or thing they are researching.

With the advances in technology more and more things are becoming different with the way they are used and things they can do. This system on a computer could effect someones work ethic. Does this system have a way to turn this off? If you are doing a research paper and you arent smiling, does that mean it will put you on something else. Is everything the same or do you have to learn a whole new way of doing things.

In the article it keeps talking about facial expressions and doesn't say anything about some of the things people use computers for like doing papers or playing games. This doesn't give us enogh information about the computer and the typers of things it does or the stuff it could do. The FACS sounds like a cool idea and thing that could work, but there are many of things that were left out.

What would happen if the FACS system would break or be down because of something. Do you have to call someone in to fix it or what? With th FACS system, could it be used on a labtop? Could this be something that could fail and ruin your computer? With the system would this effect the way you may use your computer? There are to many questions that need to be answered before this could be a hit. The more I think about this FACS system the more question I come up with and the less I like it.

The new technology could effect many factors and wouldn't be something that could be put out there and hope it sells. The systeem needs to have many of test done first before they just put it out there. The system doesn't make me feel like it is a winner. The more I think and write about makes me not want to tell anyone about the system. There are to many possibilites where things could go wrong. I don't think that this product would sell.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
4FC744EC5BDB,"Have you ever looked a photo of someone and wonder how they feel? Yes well now you can Thomas Huang form the neckman institute for Advance Science at the University of Amsterdam. Im all for this Facial Action Coding Sytem. It could show us how people long before use felt when getting there picture painted of picture taken. people could know how family member and friends felt before they past away. what if we could know how animals felt with the FACS?

We dont know how people felt back then, we didn't know what they were going through, but with the FACS we could get a general idea of how they felt at that time in there life. Say you had a family member that passed away that you never met before but you want to know if they were a happy, sad, or mad person you could use the FACS to know so you dont have to hear it from someone else. Wouldnt it be cool to know what animals are feeling? If this FACS could show us how humans felt wouldnt you like to konw what your pets are feeling if your pet was sad and you didnt know,but you use the FACS you would know and then you and do something with your pet to keep the happy. Now you might be asking how does this FACS work well ehrn the computer constructs a 3-D computer modle of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. examples your frontalis pars lateralis muscles when you raise your eyebrows you are suprised, your orbicular oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger. these reasons i just listed are why i support the FACS!",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
67CA27FD7B1F,"I believe that using the FACS(Facial Action Coding System) is important to have/use in classroom to read students facial expression and to know what they are feeling, because some teacher's may be going through the classwork or the lesson for the day too fast and a student may not understand what is going on and they are too scared or nervous to ask the teacher to slow down and/or repeat what they said so having the facial coding system will help teacher's with that so they either know who to help or realize that they are going too fast and need to slow down or explain it better for other students to catch on. In the reading in paragraph six, it says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored in class"" the facial coding would be good at helping teacher know what they need to do more in the class, like if a student is bored then the teacher would know that they need to do more fun activities in class that have something to do with the lesson for that day can help with people who are both confused and/or bored, it will help the students that are bored have something to do so they will not be bored and it would help the students that are confused get the hang of what is going on in the class and help them understand. In paragraph six it also says ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"", meaning that facial coding would help teachers be able to know for sure if a student is confused or bored in a classroom. The facial coding system would not only help teachers figure out if a student is understanding classwork but it would also help to find out if a student is having personal issues and won't say anything or they are too scared to say what's going on, it would be more than helpful to know what that student is feeling and asking them about it and asking if they wanted to talk about and/or letting them know that they can talk to you if needed instead of knowing what that person is feeling and letting them keep their emotions bottled up and them not talking to anyone about how they feel and that student ends up doing something that could do harm to them or others. With that being said I believe that having the facial coding system would not only be helpful in classrooms but in schools too.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
5F5136D5007E,"Have you ever been told what your emotional expression is by a computer. A new software has been made that can recognize emotions. It has been made to develop better ways for humans and computers to communicate. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.

First, it constructs a 3-D model of the face and the muscels in the software must move like human muscles. It makes an exact replica of your face and your face muscles. It shows you your emotion by using the location of your face muscles. For example in paragraph 3 it states,"" Your frontalis par leteralis muscle raises your eyebrows when you're surprised.""

Second, It can tell you if you have mixed emotions. It can calculate exact emotions while we can partialy do this. In paragraph 5 it states that "" You can probally tell how a freind is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."" The computer can show you this.

Third, The computer can help you by knowing what your emotion is. It can see when your happy looking at something so it can show you more stuff like that. It can see when your sad so it wont show you more stuff like that. It can see when your confused at something and so it can explain it to you differently so you wont be confused.

In conclusion, The computer constructs and exact replica of your face and your face muscles. It can tell you your exact emotion or mixed emotions. It can help you feel happy by showing you what you want to see and not showing you what you dont want to see. It can help teach you things that you differenly by showing it to you differently if it sees that you are confused. The technology to read a students expression in a classroom is valuable.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
7F1E6FE5D698,"In my opinion, yes that would be very helpful and valuable to have that type of technology in our classrooms. heres why.

A lot of students hide all of their emotions and hold them inside and that sometimes can make us do crazy irrational things, like shooting up a school full of kids. If we had this technology we could figure out how a student feels and try our best and do whatever we can to help them before it gets to that point. If we had that technology we would be able to get a student into counciling or to a therapist or just to a close friend to talk to because who knows that could save that students life. If we knew what was bothering students or knew that there was something bothering a student we could maybe avoid all of those student v. s. teacher fights that happen because that student isnt in the right mindset and that teacher had no idea.

Another reason why that type of technology would be useful is learning. Say a student was doing some school work on a computer and they start falling asleep because the content is so boring. If we had that type of technology the computer could change the way the content is being presented into a wat that is more interesting and exciting to the student. Every student learns differently and if we had that technology then we all could excel in school.

Not only could we learn better and help the teachers understnad us better we could understand the people around us better. We could learn how to recognize those faces and understand how the person we are talking to is really feeling. Not only that we could make a whole new lie detector test for authorities. If they had those they could truely find out if someone is guilty because as the passage said faces dont lie. Maybe if we had that type of technology helping the law the crime rate would go down emencely because if criminals knew that no matter what they did they would always fail this test if they lied they wouldnt commit those crimes and risk getting caught.

In conclusion, having this technology could help the world beyond our imagination. If we had this, maybe, just maybe our dreams for a better place might start to become true.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6
9638A0515968,"There is a new technology called Facial Action Coding System. This Coding System can identify your emotions. Dr. Paul Eckamn has been classifiying six emotions."" Eckamn has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."" ""-Then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.""

They have started useing this technology in schools now. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a studen is becoming confused or bored."" ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" After reading this information from the article, I think we should have this type of technology in school. It could really help the kids who do not talk to their teacher at all. But there is also a downfall of useing this type of technology.

Some of the bad things that could happen is the computer misreading the kid wrong. Therefore, giving him wrong information about what ever he is learning about. It is also very expensive. The worst thing that could happen is the teachers who went to school their whole life trying to become a teacher, they are now jobless. What is the point of paying somebody to teach a student when there is now a computer in their school to do it. That is one of the major negative things from this technology.

Some of the good things that could happen is the student actually learning. There are many students who just sit in the back of the class not talking, but when a computer can do it for them they will probably learn a lot more. They don't have to say one word because when the computer feels that you are sad/happy it would change the subject.""For example, if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" It can really tell how the student is feeling and their emotions at that current time.

In the end, we can take a few positives and a few negatives from this. In the long run it would be better but in the short run it wouldn't. Students will be a lot more smarter but a little bit less social. Teachers might be jobless but the students will probably have a better education and will just be smarter in general.

235D30ADCCD1,"I am for the value of using this technology to read students emotional expressions. This would be a gret way of futher advancing techology by starting this on the students in the classroom. "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. With this technology being able to read the emotionjs of the student, the it could be able to modify the lesson to further intrest the student. A computer that knows when youre happy, suprised, angry, disgusted, scared and sad sounds pretty cool, right? Most people would say so, this advancement in technology is amazing, but people may not be able to afford it. This would be great in classrooms because most teacher dont know that a child does not get the subject if the child does not say anything about it.

401268F9E518,"Your feeling ten percent annoyed, fifty percent boared, and thirty percent suprised. Advancements in technology has been brought to an entire new era with facial readers. One computer can tell people how they feel about themselves just by the muscel structure and movements in their face. Who would not want to know what some stranger walking down the street is feeling? I mean, I know I would. Today our generation is amoung the nosiest. Classrooms today need these computers to better understand their class. Emotional expressions can change society by understanding children, making lives easier, and progressing technology.

Children have mood changes as fast as people chose fast food over vegtables. Children are a hard age to understand what they are feeling, becuase they are so quick at changing the things they are doing and always moving. Having a brain wired to becoming board with something one day and then wanting to do it again the nest day. That is hard for teachers to keep up with. Dr. Huang commented, ""A classroom computer could regonize when a student is becoming confused or board."" But, with having a computer that classifies the six basic emotions and picks up each one takes a great stress off of teachers. Teachers have a class from anywhere to ten to fourty students. Having to know each one personally and be able to read what they are thinking to help further their education is a big task for underpaid teachers to do. Those fourty students have all different facial structures and the Facial Action Coding System uses video imagery to track their movements and weight the different units. Teachers understanding their students better with the Coding System, will help them further their education in a classroom when seeing if they are frustrated or upset.

Fourty students, fourty diiferent views, and fourty different emotions. That is a lot to take in. Having the Coding System in your classroom takes the relief off the teachers of figuring out each student. With the easy three step process anyone can read their emotions, but just by video it makes it three steps easier. With no wires and personal information to plug in. Teachers have students that do not like to share their feelings, which takes a lot of time for the teacher to understand what they are feeling taking away from other students. Dr. Huang stated, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Saving the time of teachers and peronalizing lessons for the class creates so many benefits. Not having this machine will not do damage in hurting the students, it is helping them.

Fifty years ago classrooms did not even have a smart board or computer labs, they had chalk boards. It is a fact some people do not like change. Parents probably did not like their children learning how to use computers or new technology. But our world is advacing, and makes it that much amazing to see how simply technology is helping change classrooms for the better. Dr. Huang and his colleagues are developing ways for us and computers to communicate. People think that is scary and weird. The fact is, we can learn about the artwork from hundreds of years ago with the sytem. Classrooms can have precise and exact answers with the system. Huang used Mona Lisa and they figured out that she was 83 percent happy, and 9 percent disguested. Can your art teacher tell you that?

Technology is helping further our classrooms education and learn abilites.

Classrooms benefit from the Facial Coding System. Many people will be against this new change, but they have no arguement. The Facial Action Coding System is easy, helpful, and dependable. As a teacher I would feel more comfortable with giving a lesson and teaching views ,they all understood and agreed with. Lives can change by understanding childrens minds, creating hard ache free lives, and keeping up with the new technology. ",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8
5B1286DD196F,"Plan My claim would have to be that computers who identify human emotions would be a valubale thinkg because many students come to class felling down or sad sometimes and instead of them keeping i to them selves.

Somebody would hopefully be kind enough and ask if there doing okay or if they need somebody to talk to instead of just having to go thruogh it them selves, just like a child going thru depresion at the end of the day you want to look for those children and help them. But another think would be why would we need this in class instead of using money for this technology they should fix the schools and bring more learning experiences around the country instead of wasting money to see how somebody is feeling youll make somebody happy by just saying have a wonderful day today like the person grading this test i hope you have a wonderful day and i hope at the end of the day i pass this because its a big part of high school and im clearly not the smartest student but at the end of the day i get what i have to do done and dont complain but this invension would be a good project to go around at the airport or banks just to see peoples reaction when they walk in and as there going out to see the diffrence of there face reactions. the mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile while it shows how much this computer can do,imagine a computer that knows when youre happy or sad, thatll be really creapy once it knows how you're feeling.

LIke example ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. but if you frown the next ad will be different."" this sounds good so when you want certain kind of apps to pop up but once the system knows how youre feeling is another thing instead of seeing how im feeling they should help out people in need who need the help to help them keep there emotions better, Also crazy how theis technology would make it easy for a computer to recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored. My claim would have to be that I would wan this in my class or around my school beacuse i personaly feel like many students will come into school with a diffrent mood if they knew there expresions or feelings are all being detected, instead of them coming sad theyll probabaly chear up a bit since they maybe dont want anybody to know how there feeling and itll try to hid it and change there mood from what it was at first. This process all beigins with a computer that constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, all 44 major muscles in the model unit must move like a human muscles. Some coding system facial expressions that its going to be able to read is six basic emotions like happiness,surprise, anger, disgust, fear ,and sadness, many people are not gonna like the idea of this beause people don want to let everbody know what they are feeling or what there thinking of.

4E2D058C025D,"I think the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) should be used in classrooms because it would help to see the emotions of kids. Like see if they need help or if they aren't feeling good. Mostly things like that. You could also use it to see if kids are lying or not when they get in trouble and have to go to the principle or when they get in trouble at home.

Mona Lisa: 83% happy, 9% disgusted , 6% fearful, and 3% angry! When Mona Lisa was painted in 1503 we had no clue how she was really feeling. But with the FACS it is now easy to see how she was feeling. That is a good thing because it could help us in the future with life or death situations.

When we ask questions like ""Can we actually 'calculate' emotions like we calculate math problems? or ""How can a simple computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans have to use and show how we feel? shows that we humans need this type of cool technology in the future to make things easier than what they are nowadays!",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
0873F94DA728,"Now, these days computer softwares are able to do so many things, such as sing (Vocaloid), organize our schedule, and even recognize our emotions.

This new software is called Facial Action Coding System and was created by Prof. Thomas Huang, from the University of Illinois, with colaboration of Prof. Hicu Sebe from the University of Amsterdam. These two profesors are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to comunicate.

The purpose of the Facial Action Coding System is to recognize the subtle facial movements that humans use to express their emotions. The process of creating this new technology began with a 3-D computer model of the human face; all 44 facial muscles were included. With the of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman. Eckman classified six basic emotions such as: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. Then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles.

Have you wondered if this technology would be useful for a classroom?

It would certantly be useful in some cases, for example, an investigation. Imagine there has been a case of bullying that ended up with suicide. Everyone who is connected to the victim, which is a student, had to be tested with the FACS (Facial Action Coding System) to whether tell if the student was telling the truth. In these kind of cases would be useful.

However, if this techology, the FACS, was used for only classroom purposes the would only be for Pscychology. This is a High School level class, it wouldn't be used for Elemtary or Middle School. Unless the staff of the schools introduces this technology to the kids. Unless there is a study for kids emotions at school when presented in various different situations.

In conclusion, there are many uses for this software but not exactly for classroom uses. The government, the police, investigators, and phisicans may use these to determine many things. Crimes would be sloved by studying the expressions of a suspect in a trial or interogation.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
DC8AAA60667C,"Isn't it crazy that technology has come so far that a computer can read a persons exact emotion right down to the exact calculation? Yes, there is now computer software that can read emotions, right down to the percent of each emotion. This software, created by Professor Thomas Huang and collaborated with Professor Nicu Sebe. This kind of technology should be known to everyone, especially kids in school.

This software knows every muscle in the face and understand the anatomy of these muscles. "" Movement of one or more muscles is called an 'action unit'. Then Dr. Huand relies on the work of psychlogists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS (Facical Action Coding System). Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated with each characteristic movoments of the facial muscles."" This process can read every muscle in the face and link an emotion with the given expression. It can even identify mixed emotions by weighing different units. For a human, isn't always easy to read mixed emotions.

""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive 'calculation' every day."" Yes, humans read peoples faces on a day to day basis and can usually figure out the nonverbal emotion of a person, but for a person who doesn't know anatomy, this can be hard to place the exact emotion with the facical expression they are looking at. This software can even tell when a person is faking a smile, which again, isn't always easy for a human to pick up on. ""its all about those muscular action units."" Which, is very important for a kid to know.

Technology is all around people every day, and kids know how to work technology better than most other people; therefore, they should be taught this new software and understand it. This new technology can really do wonders "" 'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huand predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.' "" All kids learn in different ways, which can become a struggle for students. It isn't easy trying to learn when you just cannot understand it the way it is being taught to you, and this technology could completely change that. School could become way less stressful if it is being modified for each students understanding.

A lot of human communuication is nonverbal, with different signals and facial expressions humans make, its not always easy for a person to understand these nonverbal signals. Which, is why this technology could be revolutionary to kids in school.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

In the article This computer FACS can tell us how your muscles can helps the omputer with the emotion you are feeling. In the article on paragraph 3 it says ""Eckamn has classified ix basic emotionsa-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movement of the facial muscles""(3). FACS loooks your face muscles to indecate what your emotion and true emotion in front of the video you are showing. It can tell if you are happy, sad or desgusted.

FACS can also tell emotions just like on your face musles.

86D7A5AD7C96,"I would not think having the Facial Action Coding System in a classroom is valuable. The fact that not alot of people want others to know how they feel . Especally teens these days. Teenagers hide alot of emotions for multiple reason. Simply because it can lead to alot of questioning about their life. Not everyone would want people to know what goes on in their life that makes them depressed or sad.

Eckman classified 6 basic emotions - happiness, suprise , anger, disgust, fear and sadness. Why would anyone want anyone else to know if they'er sad or disgusted? What if you was talking to some one and they had an awful smell . Then , the Facial Action Coding System just show how disgusted you are. That would not only hurt the other person's feelings but make you feel mean.

Dr. Huang noted ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication,"" ""So computer need to understand that , too"" . Most human are nonverbal because they chose not to be. Not every one just want to sit not and talk about their feelings. Also, Dr. Huang noted , ""So computers need to understand that , too. Understand what? How might a computer understand?

It could allow teachers to know which of the children in the classroom are having problems understanding the lesson, allowing the teacher to help them more. This could also help other studys of the human anatomy, as it shows how facial expressions are done and also what they mean. In the famous, ""Mona Lisa"" painting, many people observe her smile and think that she is being forced to smile, and that she is actually scared, frighted, or just angry. Using this computer means that we could debunk/prove this theory. This could also solve crimes, some that have not been solved to this day!

This computer could also help with crimes as it could show that if a suspect is making a certain facial expression, they are lying or telling the truth. This could help police catch people who are breaking the law, but not put others in prison for nothing. This computer could help with these problems that occur in the real world, and it would save lives in the process. This would be very helpful in peoples daily lives, and it could help people who have problem such as mental health.

First it could appeal differently to each students larning style, or be modified to teach him/her how the student wants. Lastly, it could see if a student is getting bored with the lesson or if he/she likes the lesson. This could help children learn alot better in a learning enviroment tailored just for them.

First, it could appeal differently to each student. This means that if it notices a kid frowning when showed a hard problem or a large group of text, it could change what it is doing but keeps the concept of what it is teaching. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective instructor."" This shows that the program could be used for the betterment of teaching for different people, not all people learn the same way, so why should it all be taught the same way. The computer could fix that by modifying the way it teaches.

Lastly, it could see if a student is getting bored with the lesson or if he/she likes the lesson. If a student, me especially, dosen't like a lesson or thinks it is boring, he/she wont learn. A computer that reads faces to get the emotions of students would keep the lesson being taught livley and more fun to keep students entertained. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective instructor."" I used the same quote twice once in the second paragraph and now, in this paragraph becauses it strongly supports both of my claims. If a computer where to ""modify the lesson, like an effective instructor"" students would always be engaged in learning because the lesson would always change to what is needed to keep students entertained.

Human emotion recognition software should be used in the classroom.

5678FA78260F,"Think about the time you felt extremely tired. That time where you could barely keep your eyes open, everything you heard was a blob, because you were simply zoned out. You were feeling tired. For me this time would be sitting in my english class learning about Shakespeare. I felt as if the time were never ending in that class. Students all around me had the same facial expression on them. Facial expressions are a huge key of communication. When you are out in public you see many faces around, and you can easily assume their emotions and what they are feeling. With technology being a huge factor in tody's society, we can now use it to determine someone's emotion. I believe that using technology to read emotional expressions on students could really bring forth value in classrooms.

Students all over the school have different things going on. They show and deplict off different emotions at an instant. Sometimes these emotions make it hard for students to concentrate in class during instructions or new lessons given by the teachers. Referring back to the article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Nick D'Alto, the writer, writes about a new software called the Facial Action Coding System. The new sytem was developed to determine the accuracy of emotions of people around us. If this software were to be implemented in our school, then this could be an advantage in shaping a better society. The software will help teachers determine the emotions students are feeling at the time of lecture. D'Alto quotes Dr. Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanced Science at the University of Illinois, predicting that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". Once recognizing the emotions of the student, Dr. Huang continues predicting that the software can ""Then modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This will help better the student's understanding in a certain subject without feeling sidetracked or confused with the activites of the teacher.

Although many may argue that the use of this software may bring negative impacts, many like the high cost of implementing it to a public school for everyone to use, or what if the software doesn't work? I could reply by stating that students struggle daily in trying to understand a certain subject in school, this leads them to fail classes or simply drop out of high school. Developing this new software will help students understand their lessons in school and stay focused. The software will also help counselors and teachers determine the emotions of their students. Sadly, many high schoolers have committed suicide because people don't understand what they are feeling, implementing this software to schools will help reduce the rate of suicides and drop outs. In paragraph four of the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the writer states ""By weighting the different units, the software can even indentify mixed emotions."" This could help people to better understand each other.

In conclusion, technology has greatly impacted our society and future generations. Things all over us are changing, some changes are good and most may even bring forth new ideas, many like this new software. Placing this new software in schools will help keep them out of confusion with their emotions and education. By the use of this software, students will no longer be falling asleep because the software will help the students concentrate better by adjusting to the abilities of the student to learn. The new system will also help decrease the rate of suicide and drop outs in schools. Implementing new technology will only help make our future better. If we have the chance in changing the world and societies for the better, why not start by understanding each other and our emotions?    ",5,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.8
F048B3381F8C,"In modern society people tend to be scared to voice their opinions, espescially students. With pressure of teachers, deans, and other peers most students would rather keep their hand down if something they disliked arises. If schools incorperated this software, invented by professor Huang and Sebe, then schools would get immediate feedback on how students felt about classes, teachers, homework, and school as a whole.

Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe have worked together to invent a software that is one of a kind. This software constructs a 3-D computer model of a face, and calculates the movement of 44 major muscles in the model to determine their emotion. If this solftware could somehow be applied to school computers and labtops the results would be amazing. A school board would know if students enjoyed school computers, or enjoyed a new software they were trying out. Teachers could understand if students were getting the current lesson. These are all examples of topics that students feel pressured to speak out on, and without them speaking one word a teacher or school board would understand how they felt about it.

Being able to detect the emotions of students could enhance the school experience by a jurastic difference. Since students in modern society are taught to be quite and listen to the teacher teach, this emotion detecting software by Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe could be the next improvement of schools.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2

The computer sowftware that can define our emotionsis now that people use in work or even at school use.

Imagine the world with the computer software that can read our emotions that will be very amazing. For instance, you can probably not tell the emotions on somebody face when you see them they may be smiling right at you, but what if they are feeling another way you may never know what they are actually feeling that is why i think the computer software is a good idea to read people emotions. As the time goes by people are getting tired of showing the same feeling they might already started to think that they are not getting no where with what they are feeling. Of course, that everybody know how to describe what happy and sad looks like, but what if they are not feeling none of does emotions what if they are actually nervous or scared and there is no way that you can help them.

For example, What if a student didn't want everyone to know thier emotions? Also, Isn't that kind of invation of privacy? But i can see the positive side of the new software to.

First of all, the new software ""Facial Action Coding System"", has a lot of positive sides about it. In paragraph six it says, ""A classroom computer recognizes when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This will modify the lesson it the computer reads that the student is confused or bored. Also, If the new system reads student emotions this could stop a lot of school shootings. Furthermore, If the new software doesn't recognize the student or person it could send an alert to the office and other classroom so the could lock their doors an hide.

Secondly, there are some negitives about the system. For example, in paragraph six it says, ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication."" This shows that the computer needs to understand that too. Also, Isn't the new software kind of invading your privacy? Because, What if you don't want anyone to know your emotions? Is this really going to help students learn or lose human emotions?

All in all, I personally think the new software should be used only in schools for the students, teachers, and staffs around the world.

Details from the article of the use of Facial Action Coding System to read the emothional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable becaues it helps us understand emotions, it helps us see true emotions, and it helps us connect with emotions.

My frist support is that it helps us understand. According to the article it can detake mixed emotions. For example the new emotion-recognition software trackes these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. It can also indcated where it is a gerneral smile or a fake smile.

My second support is we can see true emotions. The article staes that in a false smile the mouth is streacted sideways using the zygomatic major. In a real smile, the zygomatic major lift the corners of your mouth. So it proves that this tecnonlgy can indicate the differnce between a genuine smile and a forced one.

My last support is that we can connect with emotions. The facial Feedback Theory of Emotion says that moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. An example is a drama couch has his students smile and frown to produce those emotions on stage and really feel them.

The computer would be able to tell what we're interested in and give us articles about those interests. It could also help improve students grades or help entertain them if they're bored out of their mind, or even help art students create more life like paintings.

If these types of computers were in classrooms today, it could help give students articles and suggested sites based on what they're interested in. For example, if the teacher says that the students must choose a story to read, but it had to be online, the computer would be able to give a list of suggested stories, and, based on the students facial expression while reading each title, it could give the article that would be the best for that student. If students are interested in a topic, they are most likely to read more and more about it, thus improving their lexile level and reading comprehension.

On the other hand, it could also distract students from their school work. When the students have free time, they will play games, watch videos, etc., while the computer reads the students face while they are doing so. Making it more likely for the computer to suggest more and more unnecessary things for the student that is trying to work, thus getting distracted easily. This will cause the student to work less and less.

This type of technology could also help art students. As an artist, I personally know how hard anatomy is for newer and younger artists, and even older artists (everyone has trouble with something). It will help them to create lie like faces with the correct facial expression to match the emotion they are looking for. Not that how life like is painting determines the quality of the painting, but it will still help the realistic artists to create much more life like and will help them improve their artistc ability.

In conclusion, I believe that this technology has a positive and a negative use for students in classrooms. It will help them improve their reading and even their art, but there is also a high posibility that students can get easily distracted by this.

With the Facial Action Coding System, I believe this software is going to help in many ways. It will make all kinds of positive change in the classroom and even in places of work.

One positive change I believe it would make is to help children learn in the classroom. Kids have a tendency to get bored in class while learning, and often stop paying attention. This is a bad habit that can easily be fixed with the Facial Action Coding System. This software can detect change in emotion and help keep things interesting in the classroom. The author, Nick D'Alto, states that,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This software is the perfect way to always have the attention of students.

Another reason I think this Facial Action coding System is extremely valuable in the classroom is because it works with children all over the world. I believe that is extremely important. Children all over the world will be getting a higher education while having a better experiece, because their school time will be spent learning about things they enjoy, and not staring a screen with blank minds. D'Alto writes that, ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal."" So this software can be used anywhere and on anyone very efficiently.

Although this software has some great benefits, it also has a downfall. One problem with the Facial Action Coding system is the price. I'm sure given the amount of detals and time put into it, it comes with a bit of a price tag. Some schools may not be able to afford it. This is still a great product though, and it should still be available to the schools that can afford it. Many schools would find this to be helpful, and most likely invest. Eventually, as the software becomes more common, access to it will become easier and the price will not be a problem.

While most technology has a few slight inconviences, this software only seems to have one. The Facial Action Coding System seems to be extremely innovative. I hope to see this product in schools soon, available to children. The boredom and confusion of these children will no longer exist, which will make these kids all the more happier to go to school and continue their education.

7E95C01172E4,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes how a new technoloy called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. The new software has been developed that imroves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others. The software is the lastest innovation from the Prof. Thomas Huang of illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam.

Dr. Huanga and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for humans. In the fact these humans can perform this same impressive ""calcutation"" every day. LIke you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her/his face. The Mona Lisa can really really bring back a smile to her face.

"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huamg predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" Those were some of Dr. huang predicts. The computer can write some simple instructions that can make Mona Lisa smile with different emotions.

While looking in the mirror:

* Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth.

* Then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinking at the coners of your eyes

* Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, towards your eyes.

In the fact, these are the instructions for a face that looks happy. Its all about those muscular action units. They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one.

My conclusion, this new technology that Dr. Huamg is pretty amazing. This system or computer is a good thing it can make people smile and it can make Mona Lisa smile. It can also make the students smile or they can know what emotionl.  ",1,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.0
B9E26FE6A3D7,That technology would not help in schools because the fact that students are sometimes not happy with how computer ads put up. Teacher can also see how their students are feeling on the computer but one flaw about this is that what if it didn't work. The technology would have to have many updates to get the system right and make the experiance better. Someone can hack that computer and can be watching you or the government might be trying to watch us. How much is schools going to be paying for these compter? Maybe around a million dollars in buying and fixing it. Most schools don't have good internet or they have bad students that might break these computers and the school or stduent would have to pay for it. The computers schools have now barely even work now so why buy a computer that most likely not going to work no better than the computers they already have. Why take away a ad and putting a new ad is going to make a student happy? What if they dont like ads at all? what is the point of the putting a computer that can read people emotions by scanning their face and the students are not going get any happier they are going be excited about at first and then get bored with it. Computers are not good for kids at a young age they will get addicted to being on a computer won't go outside and then they are going to gain weight and then be fat. ,2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
A2F58A334981,"The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) has 44 major muscles in the human face programmed and their movements detectable by its software. While some may not understandable the use of this technology, it would be groundbreaking and highly effective within our classrooms. Many humans portray false or pretend emotions to other humans for various, different reasonings. However, the FACS could be used to break through this method of manipulation and deception by tracking the facial muscles being used and moved by its subject. It would allow the computer to calculate the different emotions and feelings being present in its subject, which could be used in a matter of many different ways.

Within the classroom, various emotions can be felt by its students while learning new topics and receiving their education. Feelings can range from excitement and an interest in learning new subjects to being bored or unmotivated to proceed with the lesson. Day by day, technology is further and used more frequently within our schools, allowing us to adapt new education methods. Most students in the US are presented with an electronic device by their school to complete their homework and classwork on. The FACS could easily be intregrated into these devices, affecting how education could be taught and learned. If it was being used in a correct, effective manner, it could change how we teach our students forever!

Let's imagine that a student was perhaps puzzled and confused by a lesson being taught using technology. The FACS program could detect this, modifying the information to be more understandable and/or enjoyable to the student. This would allow for education to be more effective in many different ways. It could be very different for how two tenth graders in the same class learn new subjects and topics the most effectively. If this was released into schools, it is very possible and most likely that grades would improve drastically. This technology could also assist those with special needs or learning disabilities to teach them in the most effective, best technique for them.

While being present at school, not all emotions displayed by students are caused by learning. There might be unknown stresses or difficulties at home or personal lives, causing emotional and/or physical distress. This can majorly affect their grades and learning experience, but also their overall health in general. Using the FACS to detect certain emotions and patterns in students could help notify educators and administration of possible issues with various causes. This would allow the student to gain access to the aid and assist they need to be able to persevere and stride forward with success. The health of students need to come first before learning and using technology to discover if they need assistance would invaluable to the school systems.

Technology is always advancing and evolving into different, new forms. The FACS is just one of the many things that could change our education system and how we teach students. Overall, it would provide aid to students that need it to succeed in their education and have more of a understanding in subjects they were originally confused by. A major benefit to using this program would be detecting distress in students, allowing the school to assist them and receive the help they need to succeed. The FACS could change how schools work forever if they were used in our classrooms and it would be for the benefit of our students.",6,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,1.0
86A3A166AA67,"The Facial Action Coding System is a new form of technology that enables computers to identify human emotions. Will the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable? No. "" FACS"" will not be valuable to read the emotional expressions of students. A theory and technology such as emotions and the emotional state of someone should be based off of science instead of being based off opinion. Take a minute and compare this new piece of technology to a quiz given on the internet to see what celebrity I would be. Moral of the story if the person can fake it, they can make it. Someone can make believable facial expressions all day does not mean they are happy, sad, or any other emotion based on what they look like. A student may come in looking grumpy does not mean they are grumpy, maybe just maybe have you ever thought. "" WOW, that just might be their natural facial expression."" To end with, unless this technology is enhanced and backed up with science instead of opinion I do not think it will be very dependable in determing the emotional expressions of students.

If teachers are not able to tell what is going on with a studant it make a teacher just get mad but the proplem with that is that thaey dont't know what that kid is going thought. In many different ways people are not all the same and some times school empolyees don't understand that. This technology works in many=y diffrent ways but it starts off when the computer constructs a 3-D computer modle of the face. The movement in one or more muscle is called an ""action unit""

In paragrah 6 the auother gives example's for what this technology could be in a classroom In the this paragrah it siad "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and this examople really shows how teachers can really benifit from have technology to help and tell what a student is felling and when they do teachers can try to help out and not just be mad at student for being confused. A student can really benifit from this as well,If a student feels confused there not going to want to make it seem that why. They will just keep flowing along and make it seem that they understand everything and when it comes to test time they will just fail and it's easy to understand that they don't want to seem like fools in frot of the class,but if we had the technology that we really asked for teachers will just know that a student will need help and stop the class to help the students a littel more.

Overall we need technology to help some student that have proplems learing in a school inverment and be able to puch them to new limits.

But sometimes we can't see all the emotions, because Monalisa looks that she is happy but she can feel others emotions that you can't see maybe.

My conclusion is you can see the emotions in the face but NO all the emotions.

If my schools computers did this i would like school at lot better but they can't so school still sucks. If school started to teach this kind of coding and our school computer would have facial recognization then school would'nt be so bad.

If schools brought in something new to our class sign up sheets there would be no doubt that a bunch of students would want to try this class out.

Us students need something new to our school days because it is the same classes every year ans students get tired of the same thing. We don't have a choice to go to school we have to or we won't have a good life when we grow up so why not make the school day better for us.

36BD7E8B0A6E,"I think that the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a classroom setting. While at first I seemed a little skeptical about the idea, as I kept reading I realized that having a software that can read emotions of students in the classroom could be great. It could be a wonderful teaching tool. If a computer can read a students facial expression then theres no doubt in my mind that this is a valuable technology to have. There are some really great uses this technology could be used for to help students. Having this technology in classrooms could help students who are confused, upset, or afraid to ask questions.

If the software was correct about the emotions in Mona Lisa's face being ""83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry"" then the software is really good at what its supposed to do. If the software can recognize all of those emotions from a painting then why couldnt it be put to use in a classroom. The software could recognize if a student was confused and try to give the student easier problems to try and work them up to the more difficult problems. Or the software could just show them websites or videos that teach the student how to do the problem they are confused on. If needed the software could just ""modify the lesson."" The software could also help a student who is getting upset that they arent getting a correct answer, or that they don't know how to do the problem.

If the software can recognize when a student is getting upset at a problem, it could notify the teacher so they can help the student. Or the software could just help the student work through the problem. The software can try to calm the student down. If the software is successful then the student can go on with the problem. Or if the software can't help then it could just take the student to another problem entirely.

When the software can read fear or worry on a students face with confusion or anger the software could realize that the student doesn't understand the problem, but is too shy to ask for help. The software could find extra help for the student on the internet. It could find the student some practice problems. If needed the software could even find a video explaining how to work through the problem. As a last ditch effort the software could notify the teacher that the student doesn't understand the problem.

I dont think the Facial Action Coding Software can do all of these things to help out students now. I do think in the future that it should be used in a classroom setting. This kind of technology could be really helpful in making sure that no student is left behind. If the software would be put to use in the classroom it would need some extra work put into it so it can do what it needs to in order to help students.

C1DB1D0F69D8,"I feel that this could be very usefull in the class room.

It would greatly help teachers all around the world I feel if they could get their hands on this technology.

Now imagine if you are teaching a class and all your students where not paying any attintion to the way you are teaching. You could change that if only you knew this complex system of facial mucles better to tell if what they where feeling about your teaching. Then you could change your teaching style in a way that they prefered to learn so they are not so board. Now there is a computer system that can read emotions by looking at what facial mucles are being used. This would help you reach your students better.

45CC76417C38,"In this article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is about how the author describes new technology called the Facial Action Coding System which identifys the human emotions. This technology shouldn't read the students' facial expression. It shouln't read a students facial expressions because first off there's no reason to do it at a school especially. Second of all there's more other emotions than happiness, surprised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness to tell of your face or mood. And the last reason is there's other new technology that can copy the 3-D face plus it could be dangerous.

First off, there's no reason to do it in a school. Mainly because at a school you learn about different subjects like math, english, science, etc. I do not think this is some ""lab experiment"" either. Although the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face, and has all the 44 major muscles in the model to move like the human muscles. Do we really need all that just to tell what your facial expression is saying.

Second of all there's other emotions than happiness,surprised, anger, fear, and sadness. Also there is lots of names on your face of what shows the emotion you are in. Orbicularis oris tightens your lip which shows anger, the zygomatic major lifts up the corner of your mouths,oculi pars palpabraeus make the crow feet, the zygomatic major is having your mouth stretched sideways while the risorius is a different muscle. According to the article you have to make those ""fake smile"" that has all those to test your facial expression.

The last reason is because there's new studies that basically copies your facial expression or movents to a thing on the IPhone X called the Animoji. Animoji is basically an emoji coming to life and it can talk, copy your facial expression , and if you move your head around it'll move it's head around. Plus it's also a 3-D model as well. If the Animoji see's that your eyebrows are up or down, the corner of your mouth is lifted, or that your eyes are squinted it will copy every movement. Its dangerous beacuse apparently once it captures your face, basically the government or polices will know where to find you or how you look like all because of that.

Those are my reasons why this technology should not be used on students is because first off there is no reason to do it at a school, second of all there's other facial expressions other than happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and my last reason is because there's new studies and it could be dangerous fo student.

The system can classifiy six basic emotions happiness, anger, surprise, disgust ,fear, and saddness. Also, it can help people that has disablities that can't speak their emotions.

This software can get a great impact. The facial expressions for each emotion are universal oberbes Dr,Huang,'even though indiciduals often show yaring degrees of expression. By weighting the different units,the software can idetify mixed emotions. Experts can use that to show and help themselves state how others feel.

On the other hand, we can already tell how a person or friend is feeling.

""Oh it's nothing."" replies Charlie who's obviously not as happy as he always is. Thomas would sure like to know how is friend is feeling; but he can't because there's no humanly way possible to if Charlie doesn't want him to know right? Well actually he can. There's a new kind of technology called Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, which enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable. Like in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, it could be used to show when a kid is becoming bored and let the teacher know so that the instructor could switch the lesson up to grab the kid's attention. Another effective was it could be used would be for it to show how some kids are feeling to limit them getting into any kinds of trouble. And finally it could be used to detect if one student just isn't grasping the matter of the subject that everyone else is getting with no problem. There are endless ways this technology could be used to better a classroom and this technology should be used in a classroom with students.

In the article, Nick D'Alto used a quote from Dr. Huang which was ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" In the sense that kids often time get bored in class, hence the reason they have a bad grade or get in trouble in that class, something has to change. Maybe it's the child's fault, but your traditional lesson isn't the most fun. If the instructor could find out what's boring the child and change the lesson to keep the child entertained then maybe the child wouldn't get into so much trouble with that teacher or maybe the child's grade in the class would take a huge leap. Who says learning can't be fun? With FACS learning could be something kids like to do.

In addition to keeping everyone awake, FACS could be used to keep people who aren't feeling too good get better. Everyone deals with things that others probably don't know about. With FACS a student could come into class like Charlie and no one knows about his frustrations so they try to do their normal jokes and games with him. If a student ever comes into class not feeling the best or not wanting to be bothered, FACS could sense that and instead of people messing with that kid or having that kid be bothered, that child could have the option of being away from everyone while the child cools down. That could stop the child from being involved in a physical altercation or any altercations at that.

Finally, everyone knows that all children learn at their own speed. FACS could be used to find out whose stuck on someting that everyone is flying through.

When the teacher is teaching something that everyone but one student understands and the teacher stops for questions, that one student may feel too embarrassed to ask a question so the lesson would go on and only get more difficult as time goes by. Instead of that happening, FACS would let the teacher know what kid that is so that the teacher could reach out to the kid and give them extra practice or even a little tutoring if they need it, that could really be a huge help to children that don't learn as fast as others. Usong FACS to determine that could really translate for the great or good of the grades of students everywhere.

In order to make the classroom a more happy place, a better place, FACS should be used with students. FACS could detect bordem so that no kid is bored enough to drift into space or sleep and miss valuable work time. FACS would be good for keeping kids that are dealing with things away from people that'll trigger them. Also FACS can be used to show weather or not children have questions and need help but are embarrassed to say so.

279FFE0827CF,"A student is sitting in his seat alternating his facial expressions from a frown to a smile every other minute. The student is not necessarily happy, sad, or pocessing mixed emotions, but simply playing around and testing the new technolgy that has been placed in the classroom. New technology has been developed that can detect facial expressions. Dr. Hang predicts, ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored."" What he doesn't stop to think about is wether this technology would be distracting, or bring other negative effects to the students. The use of emotional expression reading technology is not valuable in a classroom because it can be a distraction, put forth false information leading to personal problems, and cause students to feel uncomfortable making them unable to learn.

First, the use of technology that can calculate facial expressions would be a distraction to the students and the teacher in a classroom. Technology such as telephones, iPods, and smart watches have been banned in the classroom at most schools. This is beacuse they are a distraction to learning. Imagine a high technical computer that monitors all of 44 major muscles of your face to decect the percent ratio of the six basic emotions: happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness placed in a classroom of students from the ages five to eighteen. This would lead to a lot of distraction beacuse most students at this age would be curious of how it works, and if it works. Instead of listening to the lesson, the students would be messing around and trying out different facial expressions. This technology can also be distracting to the teacher beacuse they will have to be worrying about how their expressions are as well. They will be focusing on not looking negative, or being to harsh on the student since they are now being watched. This may ause them to not be as honest on feedback, and they may not be as focused on teaching.

Next, the technology in the classroom can put forth false information and casue personal problems. The technology can read, as previously mentioned the percent of how much anger, fear, and sadness you pocess. Many students at this age are going through a lot of changes and have many mixed emotions. For example, if the technology detects a particular student contains a large amount of sadness, fear, and anger for so many days, the student's parents should be notified because they could have emotional or mental issues. Though the technology seems very well designed, sometimes our facial expressions contradict our actual emotions. The technology can put forth false information of how we are feeling, and cause serious personal problems. Some people may believe the use of this technology in the classroom is beneficial becasue it monitors when students seem uniterested or bored, but a teacher can do such on their own, and all the many problems the technology gives is not worth it.

Finally, the technology can be a problem in the classroom beacuse it may cause students to feel uncomfortable. Many students struggle with their presentation skills at this age beacuse they may feel insecure or pressured, knowing that people are watching them. With this technolgy watching their every move and expression changes, it may cause them the same kind of pressure. This can lead them to not want to participate in class. In school the best way a teacher knows if you understand the material is if you ask questions, answer, and are involved. If this techology stops them from that, then it should not be in the classroom. In most schools, cameras are not allowed in the classroom, so that rule should be applied to this use of technology as well.

The use of emotional expression reading technology is not valuable in a classroom because it can be a distraction, malfunction and put forth false information, and cause students to feel uncomfortable making them unable to learn. In conclusion, the technology would bring a lot of problems to the students and teachers in the classroom. If there is only one good reason against many reasons not to have or do something then, it is usually not worth it. That rule applies here. Facial recogniotion technology should not be in a classroom beacuse it is uneccessary and brings neagtive effects to the students and teachers.   ",6,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,1.0
4B4A4368C5DF,"Facial Action Coding System could potentially be valuable in the classroom. For students with autism or some other form of mental disease, picking up on certain emotions and being able to tell how people are feeling does not come quite as easy as it does for other people. For them to have some sort of technology to help them learn how to tell what people are feeling could be a fantastic use of our worlds rapid technological advances.

To use this technology on students computers in order to tell how they are feeling and what confuses them or what they understand is a different story. In some ways, this could be a good thing because it would notify teachers when their students simply are not understanding a topic. But it also seems like a slight invasion of privacy and it seems that some people would not enjoy software that could detect your face and facial features at all times.

Our world has been making huge technological advances for awhile now. In just 40 years we went from the computer game Pong to having Virtual Reality. This kind of technological advance would be big but quite frankly not so shocking. Software that makes a 3-D model of your face and calculates your muscle movement in order to detect emotion is somewhat terrifying in the sense that a computer can now detect how you feel, but in some situations this technology could be useful.

If we had this in school, in the classrooms the teachers could just go back and look at the computer and see if we are really understanding what she is explaining. I feel as if everyone could pass if the teacher knew what everyone was understanding and if she needed to stay on a topic a little while longer. Not only would this come in handly for school related things but if a teenager or kid was smiling all the time but really felt down the teachers would know and could talk to the person on the side. It could help prevent school shooting, suicide, self-harm, being afread of not passing and more. This could really take mankind to the next leavel and push us further, mentaly.

This could save milloins of lifes if we brought this into schools. people could fix there grades and not be ashmed of not knowing the answers to the questions.

They could pull us aside and ask us if everything was going alright at home if we look really upsed or sad, anger, or even disgust.

We could change lifes if we get this, there wont be school shootings and it could be more safe for kids to go to school and we wouldn't feel like it could be our last day.

Teenagers have become very good at holding in how they feel, it's best authorities know. Emotions are key in todays society.

Technology is advancing rapidly it's best people use it when helpful. This technology could be put to use in many ways whether that is finding out how well students are learning, or figuring out how students feel on a personal level ehich could be depressed, anxious, unexcepted, etc. In article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", paragraph 5 states, ""Most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried etc."" This rains true in the classroom, when students get confused, some won't even speak up but hide their ""facial trait."" Technology could be used to hurt or help, and it's best students recieve more help.

How others feel is very important. It dictates the way they do everything whether someone is angrily making a cup of coffee, or joyfully talking to friends at their sons' soccer game. In paragraph 6 it states, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This provides an additional help to keep students on track and not stressed.

First, the apps they are using just changes the student indivaully like you can not make someone be happy on a computer you can make them look happy they should not change someone for who they want them to be vs what they are. Second, you should not change a photo or use any edits because thats changing you and you should just be you if you dont smile thats okay dont let people judge you on how you look you should impress your self not somebody eles. Third, People today need to realize that changing someone in any type of way could hurt them even worse. Yes, messing with peoples emotion or sometimes trying to figure it out whats wrong with them can set off alot of things. Instead of making someone look happy people should talk to the person that is upset, trying to be there for them maybe thats all they need or tell them soemthing postive to brighten there day.

Using this to help the teacher is alright. It could also become a distraction for the students. The teacher uses it to determine if the lesson that they are giving is hard for the students to understand or if they are doing really well with it. If the students realize that their facial expressions are being recorded or used for something, they could make so many faces into it. It would be a nice thing to do, but the students may not be very mature with it.

With this kind of technology, it could help the teacher plan their lesson so the students can understand, but they don't get bored. Interacting with students help them learn better, so if there are some confused, or not into the lesson, it shows that and can help get them to understand and get into the lesson.

Teachers would have to think if this is really worth having, or is it going to do nothing for them. Teachers want students to know how and what they are doing, but they need to learn how the students, know what to do and how to do it.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
B2E85935CE19,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" we are talking about how Professor Thomas Huang just came out with the Facial Action Coding System. It is supposed to be able to detect exactly how other people are feeling. Even if they are trying to hide their emotions it can still know how people are feeling. It is the latest innovation at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the University of

Illinois. He was working in collaboration with Professor Nicu Seve of the University of Amsterdam.

I am all for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions. All it does is beginnig with the computer construction a 3-D computer model of the face. All 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, who is the creator of the Facial Action Coding System. He has classified six basic emotions. Happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. He then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles. When you raise your eyebrows you are surprised and when you tighten your lips you show anger. This will really help us show how different people are feeling. If they are doing something for school such as a lesson on a computer and the way it is being done is making them bored or tired then it will be able to tell us and it can change the way the lesson is being taught so that they will become more interested. If you raise your lips to the corners of your mouth, then squint your eyes slightly to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes, holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up toward your eyes. The emotion that you are doing is that your face looks happy. If we have this then we will be able to feel someone else's emotioinal state because wer unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.

In conclusion Dr. Huang made the Facial Action Coding System. It can help us tell how others are feeling and tell if they are trying to hide their emotions. It can help us when we get bored when we are on our computers doing things for school. It can help make things more interesting so that we don't fall asleep or stop doing what we need to do. It can also help us feel someone else's emotional state because we unconscioiusly imitate another person's facial expressions.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
C355331B3B0B,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author; Nick D'Alto starts off by explaining how The picture shows that ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" after telling us this the author proceides by telling us how the emotions were recognized by a computer softwhere. Reading emotions can be tricky. But for a computer its different. The idea of basically reading Mona Lisa's mind and figuring out her emotion is somewhat confusing because the Mona Lisa is just a painting and there is no way to know if the Facial Action System is correct because the painting cant actually tell us how it feels.

In the artical it states that ""you can probaly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."" We dont need a Computer to read students emotinal expressions because it is easy to tell how a student is feeling by how their face expresion is at the time or their attitude. even though this would be a great idea to put in classrooms it would also be conserning for the students because some students dont want people knowing how they feel because it might embarious them. But at the same time it would be good for techers because to learn you have to want to learn and if your in a not so good mood then you wont want to learn and with the Facial Action Coding System the teacher can see if the student wants to learn or not.

The mona Lisa demonstration is very intresting and it shows what all a computer can do. It is very amaizing how far the tech has came. Also it is crazy how a computer can know when you are happy or sad. There is a lot of good things to this subject and also a lot of bad things that come with it. An example of a bad thing is if someone dosent want you to know how they are feeling and they could get mad at you. A example of a good reason to see peoples emotion who seem suspious and up to no good.

In concluision I think that it would be a great idea to bring the Facian Action Coding system into schools because of the fact of seeing the emotions of students that arnt learing or working to the best they can be. Another reason is to help inprove those students and see who needs help or needs someone to talk to because they could maybe be going through a hard time but no one knows and the only thing that could figure is out is the computer software.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

Technology, such as phones, laptops, or any devices, is not always true. They can predict about how people feel or their emtions. For example, in the second paragraph in the first sentence, it says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"".

Every people have different types of emotions. It's true that they have different kinds of emotions but what if it is fake? Computers are like robots. Computers can't prefer if someone is smiling or upset. Computers don't understand if someone is really smiling for real or faking smiling. It depends on someone's face. For instance, when a friend talk something fun, I smile but when a friend talk something boring, I smile too so they can be happy.

Is putting on a happy face actually work? I prefer not because it depends on someone's emotions inside instead of the outside. Not everybody can read someone's mind. In the last paragraph in the second sentence, it says, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"".

It can be true, but it can be false. People don't know what is going to happen next. So people have to figure out on their own.

F8EAC1A2DE99,"facial action coding system. you may ask what is that? well its a new computer system that can detect emotional expressions of students. some may ask how it works and other might be like that sounds stupid. well this system like in paragraph 3 stats it constructs a 3-D computer model of the face and detects your emotion.

This software could be really good in the stat to read what peoples emotions are in the since of having someone as a prisioner and they wont speak. another good thing about this would be if someone cant speak because of an illness so you could us this to see emotions.

there is also a bad side in using this software. in paragraph 3 ""44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles"". so if one of your muscles is not in the right spot while this software is running whos to say it wont work, or won't be able to detect what you are expressing. another bad thing about this software is in paragraph 5 it stats ""in fact, humans preform this same inpressive""calculation"" everyday. for instance you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on there face"". well like the passage says, if humans can already tell how someone is expressing on there face by looking at them, the really why would we need to use this program to find that out for us. also in paragraph 6 ""for example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow"". well thats great that it will be a more interasting ad but ads have been around for a very long time, and everyone would just have to say, they would just rather have no ads. so this program might make the ads more interesting to your need but no ad out there is going to keep someone intertaned for the full 30 seconds. another disadvantage is at the top of paragraph 7 "" your pc can't handle the complex algorithums used to decode"". like this sentence is saying the software might not even be able to recconized what you are expressing because it may not be prgrammed into the software or might not have ever seen you make that expression.

therefore, the facial action coding system is not really the best thing to use to find out the expression someone is giving you. reasons being, humans can already figure out the expressions, and it might not detect what you are expressing. for these reason the facial action system should not be used to find out expressions.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

Yes, it is a great idea because now we can use it to our advantages. This technology can help us humans better students in a classroom because now they can better the students education. In the article it states that the process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. When you read that, you can realize that this technology is way more advanced then the technology we have now. It can better the students in a classroom because what if the technology can tell that specific teacher that he/she is bored out of their mind and they do not care about the material that the teacher is giving them right now? The teachers could get that students data from that new technology and then come up with a better way to teach the material that is not boring the student out so like playing a game every once in a while. If that teacher does that, the student would be more engaged in class because who wants to sit in a boring classroom for 45 minutes and do nothing fun? NOBODY! In paragraph 6 it states that most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication. So computers need to understand that too says Dr. Huang. As you can see in this generation, people will have a smile on their face throughout the whole day, but are they really that happy in their mind? We as humans can only see the outside emotions of that person, but not on the inside. This technology can help us with that though because what if someone is for example very depressed, but they are smiling. The software could analyze their inside emotions so that for instance that person could get the help they need if that emotion is too dangerous for that person. In this article it states that according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them. Just by this little sentence you can comprehend that ""it can reveal so much about the science of emotions!"" Just a happy person can reveal how they are feeling inside and out throughout the whole day most likely. This technology is very high tech, but it is worth it. It will probably be a ton of money, but it will pay off in the future because it can help students and/or anyone that is going through an emotional life. This can get students the help they need so that they can be successful in their lives instead of failing their schooling and/or jobs. This might even be the next big thing!

Dr. Huang made a technology that can read facial expresstions. it could tell you if you are 94 precent angry and 6 percent happy.

In the Mona Lisa smile it showed she was 82 percent happy, and some other kind of emotions. what if mona did put a smile on her face, because thats how she was thinking, on the outside she looks very happy, but on the inside she can feel other emotions. In paragraph 9 line 4 and 5 says ""puting on a happy face, actually works."" what if you only had to smile just a litle bit to get a result out of the new techology. Not really being happy or sad that day you felt another way.

Lets say you were sad one day and going to get a panting done, when you showed up you looked happy but on the inside you still were still sad. on the outside they can see or show any emotion, when you get throght the walls of pain created by yourslef you are the only one who really knows what is wrong with you. The second paragraph said ""Can we really calculate emotions like math homework...and can a computer reconize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel"". meaning can technology really tell how a person is feeling. or can it tell the right feeling we are having.

In paragraph three it talks about how there are six basic emotions. What if a person did have surpised face but what if that was a thinking face. Or a confussed face. As Dr. Huang states the computer can tell when you are having a bad time with the work or how to do it, and the computer changes. knowing that wont be a problem for the children taking the test, but what if you were talking a test and this just happened. Would your test not count or would it be okay. As another person can read another persons face and think it is bad or good. what if the computer thinks the person is doing something with there face and the person is not showing any emotion but there face. As people we make the mistake to think something is wrong with another, but every thing it fine. Will this technology make the same?

I'm concluding that we should not have this technology until it can really be sure based on the real emotions a person has. Having something like this may be a bit to eraly to say that this is something we need in our classroomes, and homes. What if it backfires on the children and many more?

This technology would be great in a classroom enviorment because students can get off track or get bored very easily. Students arent very intrested in math or english they can get frustrated by doing the work. F.A.C.S could help with online learning very much by looking and rendering what expressions are happening and if they are happy and it doesn't seem like they are having trouble then it wouldn't change anything. If they have a bored or confused or even angry face then it would try and help that person by maybe changing lessons or even trying to teach it in a easier way.

In the article in paragraph six Dr. Huang says ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" this means that the computer could take that emotion and flip it around by changing somthing. Most teachers are good at spotting a child who doesn't understand or who is bored but sometimes they dont pay attention and don't see they have gone off but a computer could alaways tell if they are not getting it or are bored. A computer that could tell the way you feel from just looking at you would help alot of students it is sometimes hard to tell the way we are feeling especially when you try and hide it but the computer software would pick it up. Dr. Huang also stated ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"", ""So computers need to understand that, too""

Thus this technology would be a great and huge advancement because it could help out so many people maybe a student is sad and the computer picks up on it and it tells the teacher and that student could talk to someone or it could pick up on fear and tell someone about that and then they talk about that. this technology could teach the computers how to deal with so many things which is why it would be useful in the classroom.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

Well, that is what would be happening if their were computers that read your expressions. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" Dr. Huang and Dr Eckman have developed a system that does so. The use of this technoogly to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable.

First of all, the article states that ""Eckman has six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger disgust fear and sadness..."". If a computer was to detect any of these emotions from a student while he or she is working there wouldn't be an easy way of knowing whether the student is struggling or if the student is doing just fine. This quote from ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" shows how FACS (the Facial Action Coding System) won't necessarily be valuable to students when they are in their classrooms working.

Secondly, from

""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" states ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile"". The computers students use at home could be the same as the computers they do there work on during class. By saying this there is a possibility that FACS won't even work for styudents when there at school doing work. The quote used above shows that you cant count on FACS to be available for the use of students in class.

Lastly, from the article ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"". If a student had FACS on there computer and they were doing there work in class and they smile because another student did something nice for them, and FACS detected them smiling and then modified their work that could be a bad thing. It could be a bad thing if the student was doing their work and they actually didnt understand what they were doing and now that FACS detected them smiling they are now doing harder work which is a detriment to the student. This quote shows that having FACS on a students computer while they are working in class could be bad.

In conclusion, having the FACS technolgy on a students computer while they are working at school in their classroom is not valuable. The article does not give any examples or ocurrances of the technology to read a students emotions of having any good outcomes. The use of FACS could incorectly detect wether a student is having trouble or not, it only detects basic emotions, and it may not even be available to the use of students depending on the type of computer they use in their classroom.",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

For this reason, advanced technology should continue to be used. Introducing the FACS technology in schools would be valuable because it would create a more beneficial enviornment for everyone: society and individuals alike.

Implementing the Facial Action Coding System into schools would be very valuable for society as a whole. The article states that the software provides the exact emotions of someone. For example, the machine might declare that someone is ""83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry."" (paragraph 1) Teens' actions related to their emotions are still fairly unknown, so having this information on adolescents in particular would help us be able to identify the root of the emotions later on. It's clear that FACS would seriously benefit science.

Perhaps the most important reason for going through with this technology is that people would be more honest with each other at school. Enabling teachers and students alike to see how others are feeling would create a distinct openness in the school. Students would no longer feel that they have to put on a ""happy face,"" (as the article mentions in paragraph 9) when they're sad. There would be no point for this deception, since FACS would see right through it. People who felt sad could be comforted by others. Students would be more happy than they are now, at the end of a long school day. Having the FACS technology in schools would create an enviornment of honesty and happiness.

It's true that having a machine see right through you would take some getting used to.

Two minuets ago i would have never guessed that, but it's a good thing to know that. If it were to be a student, to knwo that he/she is maybe angry is very helpful in that it shows that we cant push them or tell them to do something the same way we normally would. We need to descelate the situation and make this person more on the happy side before we do anything else.

Yes it is a little odd to think that a humans facial structure can be generated on on a comuter, but at the same time it was only amatter of time before this would happen. in fact, this happens all the time for movies and video games. The face has 44 muscles and the computers generatin of the face must have the same exact 44 muscles in it in order to read and produce a human like analyzation of a face.

Weather what we have right now is that acurate, i'm not sure, but what i do know is that it is impresive.

People like Dr. Huang relie on the work of a psychologist like Dr. Paul Eckman who is the creator of FACS which stands for Facial Action Coding System. The exerpt says that Eckman has descovered the following emotions due to the muscle movements. Happy, sad, angry, disgust, fear, and sadness. The example given in the text is the frontal pars lateralis muscle or above your eyes rise when you are suprised.

Overall i do believe that this would be helpfull to read a students emotion to show how to aproach him or her and to show what to say and how to say it. Everything is dependent on how you say things nowadays. If you say one thing wrong that person may go off on you or may take it really well you just never know, but if that person is angry then you may want to aproach that person with care instead of just going at them full speed.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
EA48C80121AD,"I really don't like this new computer thing at all. i think that it is something private and I wouldn't want to have somebody look at my emotions and see what I am feeling. What about if somebody is sad but they just don't want to talk about it. Somebody might bring it up in class saying ""PROPER_NAME is sad"" or ""What's wrong with PROPER_NAME"" I would not want to have a teacher ask me what's wrong in front of all of my classmates. I can see it if people might want to use it to see if the students are bored with their class work but other than that I would not like it at all.

For example, when the author says ""The Mona lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face. while it shows just how much the computer can do."" i don't agree with that at all it should be your right to say that you don't want to have people ask if you are okay. This new computer would not make me smile it would make me angry. I think that they should only do it on paintings and not on real life people. I also think if they do this new computer thing a lot of people would be angry,

In conclusion, i do not like the idea of the computer where it can tell what emotions you are feeling. It is an invasion of your pricavy. Like I said before they should only do it on paintings and not on real life people. ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
E4824CBFEEBD,"Do you think we should put facial action coding system in our classroo? I think using technology to read the emotions expressions in a classroom is a good thing because it tells you where your students are bord in class, see if they are mad in class, and tell someone is tired in the classromm.

See if the someone is bord in class is a good thing because you can make the subject or class more fun. That will make the student pay more attention in class because they won't be messing or not paying attention in class any more. In paragraph 6 it says ""A classrom computer could recoginze when a student is becoming confused or bored."" What they meant by that is the computer would put a different lesson than instead making the student do the lesson being bord or confussed. That will help a lot of students because they are gonna learn more and get good grades.

The facial action coding system could tell a person if they are tired because the computer can tell by their muscles. It will tell the teacher wich student is tired so they teacher can do something about it. It will help out a lot of the teachers from telling who's falling asleep.",2,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.2
F05FD0FAC22E,"Thechnology advances as the years go by,and as the years go by they become more and more human. But just as a human has emotions and can read it, can the technology be able to read it? In and article called "" Making Mona Lisa Smille"" a scientist named Dr. Huang developes a technology that is able to read human emotions, and that can simplify the way students learn. This technology should be used in the classrooms to read students emotions because it will be easier for them, and it will help the students to learn better.

This technology should be put in the classrooms because it will help them to learn better. The article tells us that,when the technology is installed in the computer and the students use it, it will identify by their emotional expressions if they understand what they're learning or not. After that it will modify the lesson so that the students can comprehend what they're learning. By doing that it will help more students to understand their work and it will be a little easier for them to get a good grade. It will also help them when they are doing a Project and don't understand what the Web is talking about.

Another reason why the technology should be in the classrooms is because it would make it easier for the students to understand whats going on in their class. for example when a student ahs a project and its doing the researching. It finds a Website but does not understand what is going on, so the computer will recognize that the student does not understand what is written on the page, and it will find another Website that corresponds to what the student is looking for but is a little easier to understand. The paragraph six in the article "" Making Mona Lisa Smile "" tells us something similiar, It says,""If you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similiar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" What the paragraph says is that the technology notices when you like somthing or not, or when you understand or not. A technology like that can really help students make progress in their education.

The technology should be in the classrooms so that it can help students make progress in their classes. The technology would help increase the students scores, and by doing maybe more students would go to college. The technology would help students advance in their classes and it would be easier for the teacher.

It would make so many things easier and the easier, the better.          ",4,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.6

It's different, it could possibly help students, and it can change a direction in school period.

As a student its easy to get bored in class, even when we're on our computers, as stated in paragraph 6, ""..if you smile when a web ad appears on screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" That doesn't only help at school but anywhere, because we hate ads, also stated in paragraph 6, Dr. Huange says, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This is can be a big time help to students in school.

Another way this can help students is by possibly making them get to know new friends. If two or more students found alot of things in common they thought no one else would, or they never expected that person to like the same thing they like, it could possibly make new and unlikely friendships.

Propponents may say people can easily put on false emotions, such as a ""false smile"" but in paragraph 8 it states, ""..muscles called obricularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's feet around your eyes. But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorius. To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscel clues are sometimes used to spot a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity [that] isn't being truthful.""

Another way this technology would help with is teachers could make a video teaching the lesson and use the technology to see how the students reacted.

The use of this technology would be great for teachers to know if their students are confused or bored. The teacher could teach a different way each day and see how the students reacted. Then which ever way kept the students more interested and made them pay attention more would be the way the teacher could start teaching so that the teacher gets the best results from their students. If the students are confused and don't want to ask a question the teacher could see that the student is confused and then the teacher can talk to the student one on one to help the student best understand the topic that he or she is confused with.

The technology could be used if the teacher was gone. The teacher could make a video teaching the lesson and the facial action coding system could see the students face and change the way the lesson is being taught to each student making the video lesson more personal towards the student. This would help the student learn the lesson how they like to learn. This would help them absorb all of the information in hope that they can retain the information for the test.

The technology would be great for classrooms. It helps the students learn the lesson the way they like to learn. It also helps the teachers teach the students to the best of their abilities. It will help the teachers teach the students the best way for the students. The teachers will know if their students are bored and that the teacher need to change up the way that they are presenting the lesson to the students. It will also help the teachers know if a student needs one on one but the student won't ask the teacher for help.

The makers of this great softwear intend to introduce it to a school setting and it is causing a major contorversy. This technology should be introduced into schools for many reasons, it could help keep students focused, and could help sense if the student is troubled and needs consoleing.

The creators of this software believe that their technology can help students and keep them focused on the task at hand. One of the scientist, Dr. Huang predicts "" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor "". This new software can do what so many teachers cant, it can understand the student. This opens up a whole new way of learning, It gives us a guarentee of sucess. These students will now work at their own pace and individually get help in what they are stuggling in.

Many students are going through troubled times and find themselves in difficult stituations. High School suicide rates are at an all time high and more and more school shootings occur. This new software could help prevent these tragidies from happening. The majority of school shootings and suicides are because the student is being bullied or feels helpless and alone. Dr. Huang states,"" Most human communication is non verbal, including emotional communication"". This makes it very difficult to know if someone is going through a tough time and needs help. This new technology is giving us a key to understand how the students feel and know if these students need some sort of help before it is too late.

This software is nessasary and is exremely valuble to a school. It can help teachers greatly and help the students themselves. This program helps students achive their full potential and stop tragidies from happening.

Most lessons are drawn out and very long which makes me want to put my attenton else where, then what im post to be focused on. If a computer could recognize when I was confused or bored that would benifit me and my teacher.

That would put me in a better place of learning and being focused. If I and my fellow peirs was actully happy about learning I feel our mind would lock more stuff in. Sometimes it goes in one ear and out the other. But this wouldn't just help school students. This could be used to help a seller of a video game. When most people play games after while its not as fun. When the Facial Action Coding System enables the game can reboot itself to be more interesting and keep that person interested to buy and play more of that same game. Just like in school I would come back more ready then ever if I had something not boring to look forward to. Not even helping the every day life this could be a grate value to the discovery of the human muscles. Showing how your muscles in your face come together and make that facial expression.

Walt Disney harped at the advancement of entertainment and technology in the world and constantly reminded everyone to keep moving forward in their lives and to keep an open mind with new technology. Just like with some of Diney's crazy inventions one must try the new before denying them. The Facial Action Coding System would be considered one of the new technologies that one must keep an open mind to trying. There are many useful ways that this system could help out masses worldwide. It could help between the language barrier, in courtrooms with lie detectors, and most importantly classrooms. The use of the Facial Action Coding System is very valuable and needs to be spread throughout classrooms across the globe.

Students' are very different from one another. That includes their friends, their style, their personal values, and their work in shcool. With this system it will make it extremely easier for teachers to help students' education flow a lot smoother. As said in paragrah 6, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is beocming confused or bored"". This recognition could allow the computer to modify the lesson without the teacher having to take time out of their busy schedule to do so. It will also benefits students who are scared to approach teachers' with their education problems because they might become embarrassed. By using this method with the Facial Action Coding System graduation rates may increase as well as classroom productivity through the help of the lesson modifications.

Another reason the Facial Action Coding System should be widely encourged is it could help a teacher build a better relationship with the students. As said in paragraph 4, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"". This means that when any student is having emotional stuggles their teacher could be notified by the system. This would allow the teachers to become more aware of their students' outside lives so that the teacher could help the student if needed. Doing so, a stonger trust factor could be built between the student and teacher creating a more productive classroom all together.

Some may say that this system would be an invasion of privacy for the students, but this is not much different than being able to tell how one feels by just examining their expression by oneself. This system advances the technology of facial examination only. It assists others in being able to distiguish one's feelings at the moment. Going a little deeper in the student's life may actually benefit them more than it would invade on them. The system could allow the students to recieve the help they really need by delving a little deeper than a normal human would be able to.

This system could be seen as an insane new technology that some may be afraid of, but to make progess in the world one must open their mind and accept the new to help millions around the world. The Facial Action Coding System could help a plethora of sutdents and teachers with their relationship and trust as well as the students' educations and also the teachers' careers.

715555B20F91,"I dont't think that we should use the Facial Action Coding system in school. It's messing with the privacy of the kids who come into school and an ivasion on their personal space. I don't like the idea that a machine would be watching you and trying to find out how you are feeling.

There is a good side that I see to all if this as well too.

For example, it could be used to help a person who is depressed or really sad. It could help that person talk it out with someone and get the help they need, It can also catch a student while lying to a teacher. Despite these things, I still think it is like invading on someone elses privacy. It could also malfunction and say that the student is one thing but really isn't. Things like that could lead to alot of misunderstandings and confusion as well. It's okay to use it on objects like, paintings but, I don't think it would be such a good idea to use it on humans. A person's emotions is their own and not always needs shared with other people. If they want to express how they feel, then they will. If they don't then they don't. It's the student's choice. I don't think it would be fair to any of the students if it does become okay to use this. I wouldn't really feel comfortable that machine in the classroom at all.

In conclusion, I believe that this technology should not be used in schools or on people for that matter. I think that if we want to say how we feel then we do it ourselves. We shouldn't have to let a machine do it for us. I feel that it shoud only be used on objects. Even though it is a pretty neat machine, it still shouldn't be put in schools.

When the FACST (Facial Action Coding System Technology) recongizes that a student is really confused or lost. Say if it's a reading assignment and the student speaks and only understands spanish and if the spanish audio is going to fast. The FACST can see a bit of confusion and worrying on the students face and it could modify the lesson to make the audio go slower so the spanish speaking student can understand what he is being read better. The FACST could also recongize if a studemt is depressed or sad and the students or parents and teachers don't know about it yet it could possibly just email it to the teacher of the student amd to the parents. Saying something for example you'r child today wasn't very focused and seemed a bit depressed you should have talk with you'r child.

8CAF1B7BD82D,"As technology advances in a very constant and remarkable fasion, many new innovations begin to reveal themselves. While we still might be waiting for the next flying car or teleporter, several smaller, yet very significant, inventions have presented themselves. An example of this is a computer software that is able to identify and recognize emotions. Profesor Thomas Huang from the Beckman Institute for Advance Science at the Univeristy of Illinois created this software in hopes of changing the world for the better, but is it really that great? Among the several other practical uses, Huang says that the use of this technology in the classroom can be the most important. Overall the use of emotional recognition has the potential to be useful due to the ability to change the lesson based on mood, and alter mood based on the current your current status, but overall would not be 100% effective due to the spiratic qualities of humans.

Dr. Huang, the inventor of the emotional recognition, claims there could be huge advancements in the education system due to his new technology. In a time of computer screens, video games, and the newest iphone students have trouble beign lectured for six hours a day. Dr. Huang's main goal is to put a computer with the lesson plans and his software in front of a computer so that it can do the teaching, effectivly. If a student begins to get bored and their zygomatic major muscles begin to relax and visibly show the boredom setting in, Dr Huang's computer software would be able to recognize and alter the lesson to be more engaging to the student. This would easily work for many other situations, if a student is sad the lesson could use brighter colors and better diction to create an enviorment where the student is not distracted and wants to learn. Nick D'Alto describes a situation where a student becomes very confused and does not know what they are doing and how to do it, but with the use of Dr Huang's technology the lesson could be changed and break down to easier steps to correctly compensate for the confusion.

Overall, the use of Dr. Huang's software to change a lesson would be very useful in improving the learning enviorment for the students who will go on to create equally as innovative new mechanism in the future.

Secondly, the software can be used to help change the mood of a student in order to boost morale as well as create an enviorment where the student wants to learn. In this day and age there are so many things for a student to be passionate about, such as: sports, video games, friends, and so much more. This is very good in the sense of passion but ultimately takes away from the desire to learn and become successful in school. Often times a student comes into school with the worst mood possible, hating every second of it, but Dr. Huang could change things up. For example if a student comes into school angry Dr. Huang's facial coding system would be able to create an enviorment where the lesson becomes more like a game for the student to play and enjoy while at the same time learning the content.

If a student comes into school depressed, it could be the job of the system to recognize this, notify someone, and help them be happy.

Dr. Huang's invention creates a short cut in seeing how someone feels through science. At times people are too afraid to ask ,""Are you okay?"". The use of this software can go straight to the aiding of someone without even having to think twice. In the end, emotions create roadblocks for students to learn and the use of Dr. Huang's technolgy can identify and help break them down so that a kid can be a normanl kid again.

Although Dr. Huang's software is extremly useful, things can often be a little more complicate than what technology can actually be good for. While the identifying of emotions is very useful, the actual action of neutralizing them can be beyond the machine. For example, if a student is crying their eyes out with no sign of stopping, I am pretty sure a change in the lesson will not help calm that student. If a student is so mad that they just want to break the computer and storm off, no change in the lessons music, colors, or diction is going to be able to fix that. In general an actual human is what each student needs to be there for them. The warmth of a hug or simple hand on the shoulder can change the outlook on a students entire emotional status. The fact that an actual teacher cares is more than enough to allow the teacher to keep teaching. Overall Dr. Huangs software is incredibly useful to identify emotional change but really can not help deal with most situations like a teacher would.

In conclusion Dr. Huang's software holds its value in it's ability to read emotions and alter the lesson as well as alter the mood of a student in need, but is very limited in how it can help a student get through their troubles. The use of Dr. Huang's technolgy in the classroom will definately lead to advances in student comprehension but for the many individuals that need more than a computer for sypathy, the program most likely will not work.

271011381AB9,"Is this technology that is able to read students' emotional expressions valuable?

I think the value of using this technology to read the students' emotions is really important. It is important because you can determain if students show some sort of depression in there life and you can be able to help them prevent suicide. "" A classroom computer could recongize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This would help the teacher be able to help students out or try to teach them in a different way so it doesn't seem so bored or confusing.

This new technology can help in so many different ways. Us oursleves may or may not see how another person is feeling, we might think they are feeling happy but deep inside they can be sad. That's where the new technology part comes in, it is able to see what a person is truly feeling like for an exmaple the Mona Lisa painitng. "" She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."" This was all determined by the Facial Action Coding system.

08C0A3DF5802,"For me I'm againts with this technology because you can't just show others what they feel because some people may not like to show their feelings with others. Sometimes technology makes mistakes too technology is not always right. Can technology actully calculate emotions like math homework? I don't think so because not because they are showing sad emotion it doesn't mean that they are sad. The new technology might sometimes wrong.

Does expression in the mirror suggest an emotion? of course you can tell what emotion what others is showing in the mirror. Can computer tell what emotion does a person is showing by just looking at it of course not. Can technology indicate the difference between a genuine smile and forced one. I don't think computer can detect a fake smile because it didn't say that the new technology can tell if a person is showing fake smile or real smile. whoever thought that making making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotion.

To an expert, faces don't lie, these muscular clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful. Other people can tell other people faces if they are not being truthful. I know that technology can solve anything but we made them we program them thats why technology can detect our emotions, that means that technology is not the one who is telling our emotion its humans.

Using this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is not right because this emotion is private for other people. technology should stay away from other peoples business. It's not right for the technologies to just go and detect other students emotion. Students have the right of privacy for their own self. We should not use this technology. For some people they are ashame of their to share their emotion with other people.

Technology should give privacy for the students. Even though Scientist proved that they could detect someone's emotion. We know that technology is important but we have to use it in a right use not using technology just to detect the students emotions.

The Facial Action Coding System is valuable in a classroom because it can help teachers and students. For example in paragraph six it states,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could notify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". This can give advantages to teachers and students because student might be afraid to ask what the lesson was about and not ask when the software can also help.

The software is also coninvate because it can also be used to see how a someone's day is. For example in paragraph five it states ""For instance, you can probabaly tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face"", yes you can tell how that person is feeling by the look of thier face but they might be hiding their feelings. This is where now the software takes in place and is able to tell how the person is actually feeling and the software can notify a teacher and theteacher could actually talk to that person that has things going on and help them out.

The softaware can do so many things that a actually human being wouldn't actually detect, it can help students and teacher at the same time and it would make a drastic change, not just for education but, also society.        ",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4

For example im opened a program that will help me with math and they put this hard equation on the the screen i need to answer it but if i don't know it will really change my mood but the computer after looking at me have trouble for a while and my mood they can switch the question to one a little more do able or give the teacher a hint that a student need help. That will really help school all over the nation also the author also had a same thought like mines.

On paragraght 6 he said that it could tell when a student is confused and it could modefy that lesson it could be like a effectave huamn instructor'. that why

I think that we should have the facs in our computer at schools they will change the whole learning program.

The software would be great for people when what to know the percents of there emotion and what they show every day. Computers show be allowed to read the emotions of the student in from of them so that maybe the computer can help.

An example of why they should be allowed is because the computer just doesnt scan just a few it scans all 44 muscles in your face. It allows the computer to maybe bring something up to you to realise that maybe this is something that i need to look into for maybe fun or help. Its helps the students outs when they are trying to figure out what they can do to help with each emotion you have.

Another reason why computer show be allowed to scan emotions is because the software can identify mix emotion. Its said by Dr. Huang,"" The facial expression for each emotion is universal even though individual often show vary degree of expression."" The software uses video imagery, the emtion-recognition software track there facial movement in a real face or a painted face.

Therefore computer should be used to scan students emotions just so maybe is its really bad the school can do something for that student and get them the help they need.

Most parts of the day we spend on our computpers reading articles, typing papers, or searching for information. I think that if the computer could read our facial expression, it would help teachers know what way of learning works best for students. Your teacher can't always tell if you don't understand something or if your having a rough day. If the computer can, I think that it would help teachers help students.

When I read an article online for a project I usually get bored from it. If a computer can tell by my face that I am bored it could change the lession plan to have me play a game or vistit a different website that might be more hands on. The computer would be able to reconize the main 44 muscles in the face to determine the persons emotion, and from that it would know what to do next. The computer is a tool we are constantly using to help benefit us. This would help benefit teachers. For example if an ad popped up on your screen and you laugh or smile the computer will know you enjoyed it and show you more things like that, but of you frown or have a look of discust it will know that it needs to chnage the plan of your study path.

In conclustion I think that Facial Action Coding System would be a good idea for our school. I think it will be a good way of learning.

238483C3AEFC,"In today's world, students are filled with many emotions, some too difficult for even parents to decode. The rollercoaster of feelings that a teenager endures in a day is confusing and complex. But with newly found technology, it may be easier now for the emotions of students' to be understood and assisted, if needed. The revolutionary Facial Action Coding System allows computers to scan and analyze the feelings of a human, alive or painted, and is a very valuable tool to comprehend student's emotional expressions. This highly advanced technology is able to serve a multitiude of purposes that will foster an improved learning environment for students.

Because of this new and itelligent technology, doctors and others are able to read emotions of people in a way never previously possible. This brilliant computer ""constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" (3). including all major muscles. With the ability to do so, this computer scans and creates a human face and, based on the position of the muscles, is able to determine the distribution of emotions felt at that moment by a person. Tested with the Mona Lisa, this model ""can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face"" (4). By comparing the chosen face against an emotionless one, this advanced techonology allows the ability to use muscle positions to analyze the feelings of a person. The ingenuity of the computers provide the resources and ability to decode complex human emotions and, in turn, will be able to be utilized in methods that will add to the betterment of society.

The Facial Action Coding System will foster a more positive learning environment for students by adapting their online experience to their emotions. If implemented in daily computers, this technology will revolutionize the environemnt and usage of the Internet. Because this technology can map emotions, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (6). With the implementation of this technology, students will be able to influence which advertisements and pages appear on their screen. This will reduce their impatience on the computer, and actually stay focused on the task at hand, rather than getting frustrated and walking away. With the ability to control the pages on their computer screen, students will feel empowered and influential, giving them confidence and increasing their work ethic. With an increased work ethic, students will remain productive and efficient with their time and materials. The content of the student's lesson can also be adapted based on their emotional behavior. Dr Huang, the innovator of this technology, describes that at school, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"" (6). By allowing the computer to customize the lesson, students will stay more engaged, as the content they are learning is one that they enjoy. Students will find pleasure in learning the subjects that interest them while also learning about other less-interesting subjects in a more captivating manner. The innovative technology serves to better a student's learning environment, keeping them engaged and interested in the content. Schools will notice increased success rates and knowledgable students. By providing students with the chance to customize the method in which they learn, school will be more enjoyable and students will stay committed to their education. The emotion-analyzing software gives students this chance and will greatly impact the way they learn and the committment to their education.

The highly inteliigent Facial Action Coding System a valuable asset for students in a classroom, as it fosters an enjoyable and captivating learning environment that will shape the students' commitment to school. This advanced software analyzes the movement of a human's facial muscles, comparing it to an emotionless one, and determines the percent distribution their feelings. This innovative software provides students with the ability to customize the pages and lessons on the computer, giving them control over their method of learning. Students with this ability will feel captivated by their learning, as they are in control and can decide how they learn.

F39E1043CB34,"This new technology is actually valuable. In the story they talk about how making yourself smile still can make you happy. This technology could really help because then they can tell if someone is really unhappy. Most people do not want other people to know what they are feeling but it helps people around you. This technology can tell you like what percent happy you are or digusted or fearful or angry. Like Mona Lisa's percentages were 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, and 2 percent angry. With people being able to know how people in paintings were feeling you can put together what might be happening or what they are trying to point out.

This technology is actually very helpful because they can tell everything by just using a computer and using it on a painting to see what their emotions are. The computers can detect all 44 muscles in someone face. All the muscles have to move like human muscles. They say in the article that the movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit. The Eckman has classified six basic emotions and those emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness. An example they used by telling any of those is your frontalis pars laterials muscle which is above you eyes raises you eyebrows when you are surprised. A way they can tell that you are angery is when your orbicularis oris which are around your mouth tightens your lips.

There are many different things that this technology can tell about you which could really help because it could let people around you know how you are feeling instead of having to answer and you just say your fine. Like you can kind of tell how a friend is feeling by just looking at their face. Everyone can have trouble describing like the reasons why they feel like that but atleast you can tell how they are feeling. Even if you do not know why they are feeling that way you can try and change how they are feeling. Like most people do not want to have to explain why they feel that way they just want a friend to be there for them and help you boost your mood. Computers are unstanding what peoples emotions are but they are still trying to figure out how to nonverbal communicate with someone.

The article gives you instructions to do while looking in the mirror. The first instruction is to raise your lips at the corners of your mouth, the next one is to then squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes, the last one is holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes. They ask if you express in the mirror suggest an emotion and it does it is a happy emotion. Experts can even tell by just looking at a celebrity and they can tell if the are being truthful about being happy or if the are sad.

This technology could help many people. Do you just sit there sometimes and think what are they feeling or are they sad or happy well now you can tell by just doing some very easy things. Like you can use a computer that can recognize what you are feeling even if you are just sitting there doing something the computer can still tell. You can even learn ways to just look at someones face and can tell how they are feeling by just the muscles on their face. This can help friends they will be able to tell how their best friend is feeling and they can try and change their mood. Even if it does not seem helpful it really is, by just telling what someones emotions is by just looking at them can actually change a lot of things.",3,Facial action coding system,Text dependent,0.4
