Making students not participate in sports or another activities unless they have a grade B average isn't fair for many reasons. First of all, many students have a grade C average. Which is saying that it's difficult to keep a grade B average. Many students wouldn't be participating in sports or other activities. For those of the students that are maintaining a grade B average or higher that would want to be in sports probably wouldn't be able to because there aren't many, so there wouldn't be enough to have a team. The school would be missing out on so much if you did this.

Grades are important but many students don't want to only focus on school work, it makes them stressed. Keeping a grade B average is a hard task for students and keeping them out of sports and after school activities that they enjoy is not completely fair. Having after school activities or sports gets their mind of school. Students make more friends with after school activities which helps them enjoy school more and want to go.

I think the new school policy that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is not a good policy, as you can see. I think it would be a better idea to make it a grade C average, since most of the students are maintaining one.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

My opinion on this policy change will not let most students play sports. A lot of students have a C average because a C means your still passing, and you are an average student. Some people might be affected because a learning disability such as dyslexia, and it has not been noticed but they try their hardest. This can go both ways to for or against. This can go both ways because the principle is trying to weed out the kids that are lazy, and don't want to work in school and just play sports. In my opinion i think the policy should not be changed because it would take away from some kids because of their disability's, and those children should have that opportunity. I agree with both sides, but I think not changing the rule would make more sense. Both sides do have a valid argument in the matter.

B6D2D0599D30,"I think that this policy will make kids that want to play sports be forced to get better grades & keep a higher average which will be better for the school & the children that are in the school that play sports. A few supporting details are that this new policy will help the school have more activities because if a school has a good overall average then the government will be more willing to give them resources & it would make parents have more faith in school & the parents will know that they're sending their kids to a good school that will insure that they get good grades. It would also reflect to the community how good the school is & how they make sure that your kids will get better grades.

But this policy still isn't perfect because it says in the article that the majority of kids in the school have a C average and if they want people that are playing sports to have a B average there should be a way to help kids with a C average get better grades so they can play sports.

My conclusion is that this policy is a good way to make kids get better grades if they want to play sports but there should be a way that will help the kids with a C average to get a B average so they can play sports",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

Dear principal,

I disagree with you changing the policy to having to have at least a grade B to participate in sports and other activities. I disagree because a lot of people have a grade C which is an average grade. Some students are trying their hardest to get higher that a grade C but maybe don't get the subject that they have that grade in. I believe that if a student has at least a C that they are allowed to play sports and participate in other activities. If a student has a grade D or a Grade F than it would be different because those are failing grade but a grade C is not.

I also think that some kids with lower grades maybe having troubles at home or even with friends at school. If they are allowed to play sports and participate in activities at school that they could make more friends and get away from home a little bit more which may raise their grades. I also think that letting students play sports and participate in sports even if they have a grade C they could get good exercise instead of going straight home and playing video games. I don't think that keeping students with a grade C from playing sports and participating in activities will help them to get their grade up it would most likely make them mad. I do not think that you should keep students with a grade lower that a C from playing sports and participating in other activities.

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am one of your students attending SCHOOL_NAME. My view on you changing the policy is out of the question. Yes there are some reasons that might be helpful but students that love sports shouldn't have to be anything less that what is expected of them. The policy should remain the same because some kids that are very talented in sports more than others, may struggle in just one specific class. Most students that have a B average are not participating in sports at our school.

Many high school and middle school students struggle in the some of the same classes such as Math, History/Social Studies, English, Science/Biology/Chemistry. These are all tough classes but could be more difficult for students in different areas of the subject. For example, if our high school football team is going to the championships and our star player/quarter back has an 85% in Biology and is turning in a minor paper due 2 days before game time, and the teacher grades it as a C. This student with an 85% in that class has a B right now but if them get a C on a minor paper there grade could drop to somewhere in the low 80's or high 70's which no longer is considered a B average. Your star player and quarter back is out for the game and possible risk loosing the championship all because of one small paper.

There are many clubs out there for students to join and have fun in, but more than likely half the students in those clubs don't play sports and have at least a B average. Think of all the kids that aren't in those clubs that do play sports and are just short of a B average. People with an A average like you participate in Science Olympiad, Book clubs, and math clubs. But others who play Volleyball, Cross Country, Basketball, Wrestling, Track, Softball, Swimming and so on may not be capable of being in those clubs due to class grades. If you change the policy and make it so only people with a B average can play sports then you might be cutting out half of the school from your sport programs.

Please consider my reasoning about why the school sports policy should not be changed. Some that are very talented in sports more than others, may struggle in just one specific class, and most students that have a B average are not participating in sports at our school. I hope you will keep it the same.

I am against the new rule you have requested us athletes to have in order to join a sport. I write you to let you know our frustration over the reason that you say we have to have a B average to play a sport. I am playing soccer right now and I have a C average in the future I hope to play softball but with your new rule I don't believe it will happen. I encourage you to take away your new rule a lot of people don't like it for the fact that most athletes have a C average. If you are persuaded to have this rule you wont have much athletes playing for our school. For that reason we won't be able to win the championship for soccer.

You are probably expecting us to raise our grade in the subject in which we have a C, but most of the people can't get a B average, but I hope you understand that this rule shouldn't be applied to our school for the many reasons I have stated.

It has come to my attention that you are considering changing the needed grade average to be eligible to play sports from a C average to a B average. I encourage you to do so. For I have several reasons why I think you should do this. One is that the reason why schools have sports programs is to mainly encourage the player to improve on their grades so they can play. But, by letting some players who will do the minimum just so they can play pretty much goes against the concept of using sports as motivation to advance in school. That is of my reasons why I think you should change the eligibility. Another is that United States schools are falling behind with other competing countries in education. So by increasing the eligibility to a B average students of this school will have more chances of succeeding academically in school. Kids need to understand that a education is much more important than being able to play.

Although sports can get you scholarships to college you also need the good grades to. Or that talent of being the ""star football player"" or the ""talented baseball player"" won't matter. That is why highly encourage you to change the eligibility from a C average to a A average. Thank you for reading my letter and I hope you highly consider my opinion.

Deciding whether or not to change the school policy will be difficult for you I'm sure. I am a student athlete, obviously you would expect me to ask you to keep the policy the same. But, I know changing the policy and making everyone strive and try to make a B average would be a good choice. On the other hand ,some athletes like myself are actually trying to get good or at least average grades. Sometimes a C average is the best we can do for that quarter or semester. After working out , practicing multiple sports each season, games ,traveling, giving the school a good sport reputation, then trying to fit in homework when we're dead tired is hard for most of us. Wouldn't it be hard for you ,too?

Schoolwork to some students is easy . For those students who get a 4.0, 4.2, or 4.5 are using this time as an eighth grader to get ahead of everyone in freshman year. Then, you have some students who have the average grades or the B and C grades, most likely they won't do so well in high school, meaning they get no kind of academic scholarships for college. But, if the same person that had those low B and C grades was great in sports ,they have a chance to get to college or even just have a good high school athletic career. Changing the policy can mess with their futures. Now, is a crucial time for that athlete with the so-so grades to get ahead in his/her athletics, just like the student with the 4.2 GPA is preparing himself for high school.

In conclusion, please keep the policy as it is. Let those athletes have a chance for greatness, changing that policy would be harder than you think on us. I hope I could have influenced your choice even a little, or helped you understand the daily life of a student athlete. Thank you for your time.

56C594C8AD61,"In my perspective,

I think the new policy for not letting kids be sports is very unfair to all the other students in the school. Some kids really like to be in sports and other things and they just can't help the fact that they don't know a subject very well. What if they only have one C? Are you really going to hold that against them? All because of one little C? I mean, a C isn't that bad. Kids make mistakes. Some kids are strong in some subject, and some just cant quiet get there. Not everyone is good at one thing. And if they are struggling with a subject of two, you should at least understand there predicament. A C average isn't that bad at all. Now if they were making D's and F's, then there's a problem. But a C? There's no harm against it. Besides, If half the school is making a C average, then who is going to be on that specific sports or team?

What if all the people that are making an A or B average, are not interested in sports or other activity?

What's the point of even having a sport at the school if no one is making a higher grade than a C? I know you want kids to succeed in life, but not everyone is perfect. Plus, being in an activity or sport can really help sharpen the brain. Remind kids once in a while to bring up there grade, but don't make a policy. It just isn't fair for everyone. My point here is that I think kids that have a grade that is higher than a C, can be able to play in sports and be in an activity.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
2F032C44C82E,"Dear school administrator,

I do not agree with this decision at all, many of the students can not keep up with the curriculum and a C grade is maybe the farthest their effort will get them, some students are to caught up in their sport that they might not be able to keep up with the class, maybe you can lower the grade average, or think of other alternatives to get the student where they need to be.

Many students work and try hard in school, but yet still don't get A and B grades. They shouldn't be punished by penalizing them from the sport they love to play. One of my best friends plays on the school's basketball team and i see how hard she has to work to get the grades she is earning. If she worked that hard and still got a C, then i think the school should still let her play basketball because she had done all her assignments, completed all of her missing work and worked hard to try and stay on that team, and for the school to say that she cant play because she has a C would be truly unfair to her. Maybe a student is to caught up in their sport to even keep up with their homework or projects.

A lot of times a student is playing a sport, and that's the only thing their life revolves around at the moment. They put their social life on hold, they put their school work aside, and that sport is the only thing that matters to them. For example, last year in seventh grade I was involved in an after school sport. Each day i would come home at three o' clock from school. After a long day, i' d get my things ready for practice and made sure i had every single thing i needed. I would then make sure i had a healthy snack and i would leave for practice. Practice usually lasted about three to three and a half hours. When i was done my mom would pick me up around seven fifteen. By that time, i was very tired and worn out. We would sit down eat dinner, then i would take a quick shower and i was done for the day. At that point it was around ten o' clock and i was done for the day, i was completely worn out and then it was time to go to bed. As you can see, it is very hard for students to complete their work after school when they are in a busy sport. It would probably just be best to lower the grade or give an alternative to the children enabling them to make that average grade of a B.

Sometimes a student needs some time to do homework during school or extra credit. Some alternatives could be, an extra class that helps students on homework opr even just extra credit. That would definitively help a student with their work. Maybe the teachers could pay extra attention to that student or anything that will help them.

I think that we should keep it at a C average because Some people that play sports stay at the average to play, and if you made it a B average then they would have to go to practice and go home and study and not have enough time to study. Then when they take the test they had to study for they wouldn't do so great on it them there average would go down.

Then they wouldn't have a lot of people to play sports. Sports keep us active and in shape. It keeps us healthy if, students couldn't play sports then kids wouldn't be so healthy we would all be fat, and im sure we don't want America like that. I think a lot of people struggle to make B averages. A lot of people cant learn quicker than other. Some people need time to go home and study not stay up all night have a test fail it. Not be able to play or be lazy for the game.

I would love for them to keep at a C average. C' s aren't that hard to make if you try, but if you don't have a lot of time to study then there isn't much possible chances to make a B average. Not a lot of people make B' s and A' s. I would hate for you to make it a C average. I wouldn't like it at all. Then they wouldn't pay to play a school sport, then the schools would have any money from they parents paying.

Sports are for fun, and competitive. Something active to do. Something that make a person happy. I'm sure you wouldn't want to take that away. Im sure a lot of parents wouldn't be so happy for there child about this. The kid would be pressured to do better, then they would be able to do the sport, then they would get so caught up in it they would fail at keeping there grade up then they wouldn't get to play there hobbies.

The sport they play could be something they want to be when they get older. They need lots of practice when they are younger to be a good player. This sport they play could be there carrier. Then they wouldn't have much of a chance to make it in a good collage they want to get in for there sport.

I believe that changing the policy to play sports with a B average or higher is a great idea. Many students need to take responsibility of their grades, if they are or aren't playing sports. Some students, who play sports, concentrate on the game more than their text books.

Getting above C average grades shows good character. If they care about what they get on their assignments and tests, then they should care about how they act towards each other. This would help on the field and in the school building. The players need to build good character so that they can work as a team, achieve well in their grades, and their overall school sportsmanship.

Also, once students get into middle school and high school, grades and sports get serious, especially in high school, because their grades are shown on their transcript when students apply for college. Some collages won't let students ,who get low grades, play on their teams in games. That could affect their whole career. Then they wouldn't know what to do. They would be stuck and would have to apply for smaller college. They would have to pay for collage instead of getting a scholarship. Everyone knows that can get really pricey if you don't have a lot of money. Plus, in this economy, you need every last dollar you can get. If the students get a loan and can't pay it off, they could end up in debt.

Getting a B average grade in their classes would help the students feel proud of themselves for accomplishing what they want to achieve, whether it is getting a good grade, being able to apply for a big collage, have a well displayed transcript, or have a good recommendation for a collage application that is reflected off of their significant character, or any thing else that they are happy about getting. This would help the school's students entirely and to help each individual student's best work shine out.

My opinion on that is actually that i think its a good idea. I think its a good idea because then students will be motivated to actually try in school and get better grades. Also they would get to play the sports and activities they want. I realize that many students have a grade c average and probably think that its unfair to have to raise your grade up to a b to play sports but i think that if the student tried hard enough they could get a b and play the sport. A way students could raise their grade is by doing extra credit or just by doing the work and paying attention.

Students don't honestly aren't always motivated to do good in school. That's why many students don't have a very good grade but if they want to do sports or activities and realize they can only do them unless they have a b average then they will get focused and excel in school so they can play their sport or activity. Let me reiterate that I know many students think its hard getting better grades but its not that hard. To boost their grade up they could so some extra work. They could pay more attention in class. I think if they did that then they would get a good enough grade to do what they want to do. If the student isn't getting a good grade because of bad test scores the i think they should study more before the test.

I think getting into sports and activities is a privilege so if the student doesn't even have a b average then why should he/she get to be in that sport? I guess if they have good behavior in school then it makes the chances into getting into a sport better but if they don't have the grade then why should they get into it?

2C9FA5274252,"To the Principal,

I think that the new policy you want is terrible. A ""C"" grade is average! The policy should be to maintain a ""C."" For many students, extra-curricular activities are great for their grades. They are for me. If i don't play a sport, I will go crazy. It provides a much needed break from studies, and it is better for health. You need to ditch this new policy.

It could be disastrous for your students. Take it from me, a current student. I have seen the fallout of many friends from policies like this. I know what it's like. So I think that you need to get out before something bad happens.

A ""C"" grade is average. The average kids can still do well. If they have a ""D"", then yes, I agree, they shouldn't be playing sports. However, a ""C"" is still an average grade. Those kids need a chance to be great. Who knows? Maybe they will end up doing something great all because they were able to play sports this one year in school. Haven't there been so many average people that have done wonderful things for our world, and haven't there been so many ""average"" people that have excelled in sports? They deserve the chance as an American to at least try out for sports. Now, don't get me wrong. A ""B"" is an excellent thing to achieve, and they would have motivation, but some kids just can't reach a ""B,"" and those are the kids who will not benefit from this policy.

Sports are huge for me in my everyday life. It is a great break from studies, and a much needed one too. We have lots of homework, and if we sit down and do it all in one time, we won't retain it. That's called cramming. Breaks are great for the mind, and for a student's grades. So, if students are going to take a break, let them do it with sports instead of sitting down and wasting their time with mindless video games. Exams are another important time for breaks. Many people try to cram. They go home and study for hours on end. That is terrible for them. And, if they were on a sports team, they would get a break because it is not acceptable to miss practice because of exams.

As we all know, health is a huge issue in America. If those kids that just can't seem to get and maintain a ""B,"" no matter what they do, aren't allowed to play sports, they will use their time for other things. Video games, parties, food, alcohol, drugs, sex. Those are just a few of the things that kids with too much time do. They are all for pleasure. They are terrible for health, and can even lead to death. You don't want any of your students to die, do you? I know that you are a sensible person, and you would never want to feel the guilt of a students death.

Overall, the ""average"" kids need a chance. Every principal wants healthy kids, and good grades. Well, sports use up time. Kids with too much time are the ones that get into the wrong things, or the wrong study habits. They could study very little for 6 hours instead of studying very diligently for 1 hour. They retain more from the one hour than the distracted 6 hours. Michael Jordan was average. He was cut from a sports team in high school. And look what he did. He changed the modern-day world forever. And who knows, one of your ""average"" students could one day do the same thing.

I know a lot of the boys and girls here at SCHOOL_NAME love sports, and when they cant play because they have a sixty-nine they are pretty much heartbroken. So they decide to pass with barley is seventy, I think this isn't very good, that means that all the baseball players, football players, volleyball players and etcetera are only doing barley enough to pass there classes with seventy.

So, if you decided to change the school policy to where you couldn't be in sports, or any other clubs unless you have an eighty or higher, I think this will push the students to have way better grades then they do right now, here at Sun Ridge I know a lot of my fellow students love being in sports. That group of students that love being in sports includes me. I participate in cheer leading, volleyball, and soccer. So, since I know what is to be worried about your grades because you want to play I know that for a fact I would want to play and I'm not going to let and seventy stop me, so I would be pushed to get my grades higher and work hard in class.

In the long run, when we're applying for college and they see good grades on our record, we are going to gain from it. Sure, it's going to hard work and time, but we will benefit from it. Not only because colleges will see that we had good grades, but we got to play, represent our team.

I heard that you are considering about changing school's policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I think it is good idea to changing school's policy, but I would think more about the students. Many students are having C average right now. If you change the school's policy, some of students will get B average, but what happened if not most of students are getting enough grade that you wanted? I bet the most students will arguing about this school policy.

The sports are students hobby. If they don't have sports because of the grade, they will have stress. I think this school policy will going good, but they will get stress of it. Also, it is not a high-school yet, they need some break. If you wanted to keep the most students' grade, you can think of more homework, or more work in the class, but don't give too much homework or work. Just get little bit more and more and more. Start with one piece of paper, and keep add one more paper, then the students won't going to have hard time to finish with it. They might don't know the difference, because they might got use to it.

Hello my name is STUDENT_NAME, and i would like to tell you about how i feel on your new policy for sports and curriculum .

Well many people including me have a C average as our grade. But that doesn't mean you should punish us. We very well could be failing but were trying our very hardest to not be. Many things in the curriculum are very difficult for us to grasp, and understand, but that doesn't mean we aren't trying our very hardest to get our grades up. now this is not the case for every student, but in my case it is. I am having a great deal of difficulty in math right now, and that's because we are covering an area of material that I don't fully understand. I keep trying harder and harder everyday but the formulas and numbers just don't add to me. But I have had a great grade in this class all year until we got onto this subject. Many kids struggle with a subject that is difficult for them to learn. But we shouldn't punish them for it, just because they don't understand. Now I can understand why you would change the policy for people who don't care about they're grade's and don't care to keep them up. But for the kids that do care they're just not getting the material that we are learning, why should they be punished to. Maybe being in a sport will help them learn that, if they want to stay on the sport then they have to keep they're grade's up. Also if you change the policy many students will have to leave the sport they love, and you will have not very big teams and the school would lose a lot of money. Now I'm not asking you to lower the policy of the grade average but all I'm saying is, us students try our hardest everyday to do our best, But sometimes our best isn't good enough. But why should we get punished just because we had a rough or an off week. maybe sports will help the students mature and learn that they have to keep they're grade up if they want to stay with the sport they love.

So please Principal TEACHER_NAME, please reconsider changing your policy of our grade average. I think that if the policy stays the same then the students, you, the school, and the district will benefit from our curriculum and sport life. So thank you for taking the time out to read my letter and I hope you think about reconsidering, I promise you and others will benefit from leaving the policy the way it is. Thank you again.

I believe that not letting students participate in sports without a B average is a good idea. Students active in sports generally don't have much time for studying and homework because they are so occupied in their sport and are too busy with practices. If a student has a B average in school, then they most likely are a hard-working student that believes their grades are very important. If they have a lower grade average, then it is possible that the student will slip farther behind in class and have assignments piled up.

Students that participate in sports have practices very frequently and usually after school. If a student is working on sports and practicing so hard and so much, they will not have much time for homework. If they start to fall behind on homework, they don't finish it or they get points taken off, or they don't learn anything from a class discussion that refers to the homework.

If a student has a B average in school they are generally a hard worker and will find a way to juggle both school and sports and wont slip behind as quickly and they might if they had a C average and were already having a hard time understanding some concepts in the curriculum. Students in sports get home after practice exhausted and will most likely need to rest afterwards, creating a smaller gap of time for homework and studying. After resting, a C average student will start on his or her homework and probably need to figure it out first, read directions, then start having trouble part way through the homework, and it might take them more time to get it complete, then they will get frustrated and give up, not finishing. A B average student would rest up quickly and work hard on their homework to make up for the time they missed while at practice and not stop until it is completely finished, then check their answers and the next day will eagerly engage in the discussion on it

A B average student will take notes in class and work hard on assignments when a C average student might slack off a little, or not try as hard in class as others might. With sports concerned, the C average student will begin slacking off more and falling behind and will only be able to think about their next practice, concentrating on only sports. A B average student will focus on school very hard to keep their grades up so they can continue to be in sports. A rule that only B average students or higher can play in sports will be good for the students who work hard and might encourage students to keep their grades up so they too could be in sports and could easily boost the schools grade average and help kids learn better.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I think students must have a least a B average to participate in sports. That way the students can bring their grades up. A lot of students would want to bring their grades up because they would like to participate in sports. That's a way students can bring up their grades. Maybe the students can bring their grade up and that way the students can work harder in class.

That way students can work hard and participate in a sport that they deserve for getting good grades. This policy may work so students can bring their grade up and stop failing their classes. One way they can bring up their up and be able to participate in sports is by turning in there homework and completing their work in class.

Here at SCHOOL_NAME we have a policy that says "" If you have more than three (F)'s you cant participate in a sport"". That's why a lot of students try to get a good grade, and that's why the students turn in all their work, in order to participate in a sport.

3BAA2C7E2CA2,"TEACHER_NAME is thinking about that students with at least a grade B average are allowed to participate in sports or other school activities. I disagree with this because, some students have just below a grade B average and i don't think that it is fair that someone who has a 2.8 or 2.9 GPA isn't allowed to participate in school events. Also, i think the rule isn't fair to those who are already on the team that have a grade C average have to be kicked of the team. Lastly, I think the rule is unnecessary.

First, the students with a GPA of a 2.8 or 2.9 that aren't allowed to be apart of school events is absurd. Why should they be not allowed to do school events they just try as hard but just don't have all the consistent grades to be at least a 3.0 GPA. Well, the rule says that they need to be at least a 3.0. Yes it does but the kids who have GPA around it have some A' s and B' s but just have some bad grades in the subject that is hard for them.

Also, the students that are already on the team that don't have a grade B average shouldn't be kicked out from the team. The reason why I say this is that they put forth the effort for the team and the school but some of the kids with a acceptable GPA

don't try as hard and they still stay on the team that's ridiculous! The kids with the lower GPA should have put forth the effort that they put in their sports. Well, they do put forth the effort in school it's just that it harder for them to keep the grades as consistent as they want to be.

Lastly, I think the rule is unnecessary because the old rule of at least C average i think was better than the new rule. The reason why i say that is that the rule now is harder so that most of the kids can't try out for the events that they want to. Yes, true but that means they have to try harder. But, what about the kids who have a learning disability where it limits their learning ability.

9F3D55C63C0F,"Why should students have to have a ""B"" grade average to play sports if in college they only need a ""D"" grade average? Do you think we are more prepared for that than college students?

Not only are we not more prepared than college students we are less prepared than college students. You would keep a star athlete from getting scouted just because they don't have a ""b"". That would be depriving that student from a scholarship and possibly farther education. That is wrong you might destroy our futures because you want us to have better grades. Let me tell you something grades are not everything. people can go on just fine without good grades. Take Albert Enstien for example he was one of the smartest men of all time and he dropped out of school. I'm not saying that kids can just drop out of school that would be ignorant of me but just getting a good grade is not that important. A grade ""c"" average is not bad you can get in to a very nice university with a ""C"" average.

I think that your idea to change the school's policy so that students have to have at least a grade B average to participate in sports is a great idea. It will get students to focus more on their school work so that way they can play the sports they love to play. To be able to play a sport in a school team is a privilege, students should have to work hard in school in order to have that privilege. Since many students have a grade C average, this policy would most likely make a positive learning curve in the grade system. More students would encouraged to get their grades up and they would have a better future because of it.

Being a student at our school, I think that it is a wise decision that you have made to only allow students with a B average or above to participate in sports or other such activities. Here are the reasons: students will have to work harder in school, they will get rewarded for their efforts, be more conscientious students, and therefore be able to better contribute to your school.

Students that have good grades are the ones that coaches want for their teams. I have learned this personally and think that if you are a student with good grades you are more likely to work harder in their sport or other activities as well. Getting a B average may not be easy for all of these students, but if they truly want to play the sport or do the activity they will want to put in the effort to get the grades needed to participate.

If students get a B average it is more likely that they will excel in their extracurricular areas, because it will be rewarding after getting good grades. Playing on sports teams has shown me that the kids who are willing to work hard at school are also willing to work hard in their sport or other talent area that they may have. This is another reason that implementing this rule is a good idea.

The school will also benefit from this change by having more conscientious students in its walls. If students have to be pushed mentally, they will be more willing to be pushed physically. I think that having better students will also translate into better athletes and kids in other activities.

In closing, I would just like to say that I agree whole-heartedly with your decision to only let students with a B average or higher participate in sports or other activities. As shown throughout this letter, I think that our school will benefit greatly from this and will grow not only academically, but in our other areas. I hope that other schools will follow our lead and raise the standard for grades in schools nationwide.

I think you should change policy for sports because more students should try there best to get good grades in there class because there trying to stay on what every team there on. Many students on a team get better grades in there class and some students who don't try getting better grades in what ever class there in get kicked off the team because grades come first in school not the team

If you made the policy for school sports get a B or A to stay on your team the schools over all GPA would be much higher because more student would try getting a good grade in what ever class there in. that a good thing for the class and school over all to. If the kids who get bad grades get kicked off the team would try their best next year because they see what they must do to stay on the team.

Fact more of the population try and work harder if there something on the line.

when your on a team theirs some much you can lose if you get kicked off. you can lose your friends, some of your team mates respect because you weren't trying your hardies to stay on the team.

you wouldn't want to lose your buddies over something like no trying in school and only thinking about the sport and not your grades.

Secondly reason why i think people should get involved with sports because if kids get along together there would be less fighting and less violence. so that way kids don't have to go down the street watching their back. Also kids would be trusted and they would know to stay away from drugs and other thing.

last reason is that kids would be more focus in school and wouldn't be thinking what is for dinner also because kids would let there energy out playing and not in the class. so then they will play outside not inside.

44C8DE8F569D,"The principal's duty is to provide an encouraging environment for the students and to educate the people who want to learn. It's also their duty to provide the same services to one student as to another. Offering only sports or other activities to those that cannot maintain a grade B average at the least is not fair, and the action prohibits those who do not make the cut from enjoying the same as them. Does it truly matter whether or not a student has a good grade in a sport? What does a mind adept in academics truly bring to the table?

There are hundreds of people who have attained scholarships to first tier universities like Harvard or Yale for their ability to play sports, and not for their grade point average. They use their skills in those activities to succeed in life, to pave a career path later on. These people have been playing their sport for years back into their youth, mostly participating in school teams. What would have happened if they had not been accepted into the program for their lack of good grades?

Not everything has to be about intelligence.

Students with slipping grades may be a risky choice to accept into a team, but this is an issue of self-esteem here. True, their grades may drop even further with their occupation in their sport, but what truly matters is their confidence in themselves. If their grades were slipping in the first place, then what chance is there of ever getting it back up? Playing in an activity that they love will surely bolster their confidence in themselves, and that is what childhood thrives on.

Please, principal, consider the following. Childhood is all about relaxation of the mind. Children cannot enjoy themselves in school if they are not allowed the same things that their fellow classmates might be, in cause of a bad grades. This may lead to them to developing a disappointment in themselves, feeling something to be lacking to their person. Barring them from anything at all, like sports and activities, is not for their own good. It is to the students' harm. Let the students enjoy youth while they can, playing for their teams, and possibly create a path in the future for themselves later on.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I disagree with the new policy of sports and activities. Kids shouldn't play a sport just because of there grades. They should be allowed to play a sport just the fact that it makes them become have confidence, have communication , and show off their skills.

By playing sports kids become confident in what they do. It teaches them to never be shy and face your fear. They learn that when show a project to someone it is the same thing like playing your sport, the fact that people stare is not as bad as what it seems.

It lets them have communication towards their teammates. By communicating it doesn't let them become shy around anybody. They learn that they should just say what is on their mind. They become more influent talkers and know what they need help on with speaking.

They can show how great they are at something. They may be bad at something, but they know that they are good at something for sure. It shows that are ever talented at what they do and also that they put a lot of courage and effort.

I believe that students should have at least a grade C average to be able to participate in sports and other activities. Having a C average isn't failing it just means they need more work to help them out in the subject. Now if they are not doing work they are goofing around in the classroom then yes they shouldn't be aloud, but if they are not goofing around and they are doing their work they just need some more help then they should be able to participate is these extra choricial activities. Now those with D and F average of course they shouldn't be aloud to participate. Now how you can find out if the students are doing their work is ask the teachers how they are behaving and acting in the classroom.

At this time of year there are many sports people want to play or never played before. There are many sports already which you need a G.P.A. for, which is good for many reasons because honestly you should be most focus on your school work then your sports but most kids would much rather be playing what they love, not at home doing math homework or any subject for that matter. Sports are a way to meet new people and see what your good at or want to do.

There are a lot of kids with the straight A' s that don't play spots. The kids who do have many things to do in the day, and school work usually comes last which makes things very easy to forget. Yes there are reminders for things like homework projects, but what about test and quizzes that can easily bring one of your B' s down and sadly no more sport now that doesn't seem too far. For kids to play sports these days there are high expectations and they have to fulfil them. Its not about winning or losing, but to most people it is.

You should have good grades, because it what helps you with college or anything you want to do like go on vacation with your school you will get interview and they look at grades to see who really should have the privilege to have the opportunity to experience something like that. Then there are the kids who have so much to do that there grades are slipping which is unacceptable for the school standards.

Now if the student had D average and they needed a C average they should not be able to play sports they have not put it all in to there grades.

I am very sorry you are considering taking away the sports and other activities just because of students having a c average grade. If you feel that you should take the sports or other activities just because some one has a grade lower than a c average you should take a look at what they are struggling at. First I think it is unfair to take the privilege because some students have a learning disability. It is the schools responsibility to help that student if they need it. Second I also feel that as a school they should help the student achieve a higher grade. The teachers should give more help if the student wants it.

Why would you consider taking the privilege away from students receiving a c. Maybe a student does not have a good life at home and they struggle to complete work because they have no help at home. What if the students are trying their best but don't understand the topic? Or maybe the class is too loud, or the teacher plays favorites? Think about all the possible things that could result in a c average grade because the teacher or subject where a difficult aspect?

The problem with taking away an extra curricular activity is that the student might not have a good life at home. I do feel that this still should require a grade d average or above to play in sport or other activities.

Please consider this a helpful matter. Students need the extra activities to get away from home, enjoy themselves, and maybe help find some things they didn't know they could do.

8315EB545E9D,"I think you should and should not change that policy because of several reasons but the biggest reasons are because most students will not have an average of a B. And the kids that want to be in sports will maintain there grades at Bs.

The reason why I think students who want to be in sports or other activity's will not be able to maintain a B average in all classes. Most student that go to our school are more social than others from my point of view. Kids in preschool are exited to come to school everyday and want to do school stuff and don't hang out with other kids. By time going by and them growing up to more social they are and wanting to go to the movies with friends and not do there homework. And when that happens in time it brings there grades down from A' s to B' s to c' s. then they manage for the rest of there school time to mange that grade. Maybe sometimes students don't care if they have good grades or not but want to be in sports then they will maintain there grades at an average grade for it.

The reason why I think it should be changed too is because a person who wants to be in sports will try to keep there grades at a B just so they can be in sports. The kids will push them so they can be in sports. they will push for something that they want. Most kids would try harder for something that they want.

If they didn't have sports or activities they may get over weight or not be used to physical activity. I think i is very unhealthy and totally unfair to other students in the school. Yes, it may be good so students may get their grades up, but some people may not be able to. Also its very unhealthy what if the student does get a B grade after so long of not exercising and they finally get to play but they are not used to it. It may cause some serious trouble for the students heart and body.

Actually I personally think it is an awful idea no matter what the grade students should at least get exercise everyday at least 30 minutes. It is better than nothing. Plus It is good for the body. So it can get used to exercising and be healthy. They can get healthier everyday just by a little activity and/or sport(s). Also what if they never get a B grade? They may later on they may have to do a lot of physical activity and they may not be used to it! So basically earlier activities basically help them for later on in the future.

I think it unfair also because its part of the school to have physical activities for kids to enjoy and become healthier and stronger. What if most of the school had less then a B grade? You wouldn't see a lot of kids running around only a few. Its unfair also because they need exercise to be fit and not gain weight or become overweight. So at least let all grade averages have physical activity and sports they may not have earned it but it would be better for them. In the future. Trust me kids without sports and activities would be very boring and very unhealthy.

So i think the principle should undo the changes in the school. It is positively wrong and shouldn't be done under any circumstances. Kids should be able to run around and play sports they may enjoy. Having exercise is probably saving that kids life from gaining weight and having an unhealthy heart. Its the best for the kids and the school! Maybe later on it will pay off eventually.

It is true that some students have a C average, but these students are great at the sport they are playing. They may become somebody when they get older.

The team may need that student for a game or so to win the District Championship for the school and hang a banner up.

Games are important for a kid if there in school because it may be the last game they play ever, but they wont know it unless they play school sports and at school sports may help you with what you may want to do when you get older in life.

I strongly agree to your new ""B Average Policy"".

I feel that many students focus too greatly on sports and not enough on academics.

With the new policy i think a change will happen in test scores and the schools overall grade.

Though I'm sure many students will be writing to change your opinion on the policy, I recommend you stay with it.

Mrs. Principal, many students are determined that they can make it into the professional league with his/her' s sport, but frankly the chances are very slim.

I feel with the new policy it will at least motivate them to do better in the classroom before they go out on the field.

If the school's average could go from a C to a B then the school could earn all sorts of awards such as most improved and most motivated.

Not only would this give the school a better reputation, but it would also nominate us in the county and state to receive equipment, such as new computers, Smart Boards and new text books.

All of this would be caused by the new policy too.

The possibilities of what the ""B Average Policy"" will bring are limitless.

In my part of opinion i think that students not being able to participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is great idea. There are many kids that just want to join sports, and are not doing good in their academic or unified art classes. It is very important for us to have at least a B average in all our classes because learning more, and studying harder is something we can do so we could do sports . Also it would be an advantage to the school and for us kids. If this policy does apply, many kids will start working harder, trying harder, and improving in their academic skills. You will see a difference in grades and averages if the policy does apply to the school. It i will not be a difference that will change in a bad way ,it will be in a good way kids will be learning more, and doing more work, more homework more often because sports is a very good way of us kids having a fun time after school hours. For example, kids at our age tend to do many sports because they do not want to be home alone or bored. We like to go outside or spend time with our friends, but most of the time it's a lot of friends getting together to go outside to play a sport. Also, many of the sports that we play outdoors or indoors our school has mostly all of them and many kids try out for all the sports. They think that they will just play with a C average , that is not right. A student must have at least a B average to know that he is not just in the sport to play, but because he is working hard in classes and also in with his team.

I believe that students should be allowed to have lower than a B average to participate in sports and other activities. Sports are important to athletic students. Maintaining a B average and the stress of sports is very hard. Perhaps it shall not be much lower than a B but a high C. Anything lower than a 85 should not be participating in any activity. I believe you should not continue with the procedures you are making because a students deals with the stress of grades and also an activity they're participating in. Academics and activities may be overwhelming if a student has too much of the other.

I suggest that if a student has great talent in the activity they're participating in has a low grade , a teacher or coach should warn them and give them some time to get their grades higher before they are kicked off a team/club. This will warn a student and let them know to excel in academics but not just in sports.

To start with, kids wont be able to be active. They only want to do a sport because they can have fun and loose weight for free. Sports are something kids should be able to enjoy at school no matter what. And because you wont let them play they will be very upset. Being upset will lead them to eat more play less. Adults always want us to be active might as well let us be good grades or not.

Continuing, they wont make any new friends. They wont have anybody to be there for them. Some kids don't know how to make friends but if the play a sport they will be comfortable with themselves and have more confidence. Some kids who have bad grades probably don't have anyone there for them, maybe if the play a sport they could find a friend that could be there for them. All because you let them play a sport their grades could get better.

Lastly, not letting them play will result them going home watching tv. The television rots kids brains and that's not going to do their grades any good. If only they could play a sport and get all ready and active their grades will sky rocket. The television has cartoons and all that bad stuff.

CE6645D21A3C,"DEAR TEACHER_NAME, I heard that we cant play any sports or other activity without a B average. I think this is unfair because student that do try their best sometimes still get a C and they want to participate in sports and other school activity. Also you shouldn't judge a student on how good their grade is. Because some kids with A

and a B are mostly the who gets in trouble. I think as long as you have a

C average you should participate in sports and or school activities. Like say your son had a C average and he wanted to play sports but his principal told him that he had to have a B average to play football. And he came home all depress because he try hard in school but still gets a C average and he wants to play football what will you tell him. Keep on tying you can do it don't give up. and he says he always try hard and he already given up he wont be a football player when he grow up like he wanted. That's how we feel to much pressure and we give up we don't try hard anymore. Is that what our teacher parents and government want .us to do quit think about it .

As a student, I do not think it is a good idea to change the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I think the rule should be for a grade C average. Many have a grade C average and are still trying their hardest! Excluding them from activities will not improve their grade if they're incapable of it. A grade C is average! Why should the average student not be allowed to participate in anything? Maybe they get nervous during tests, or have trouble with writing. They're still trying.

Another reason why I think it is a bad idea is you would lose a lot of extra activities because nobody was there to participate in them! A drama club can't just have one actor in it, they would not be able to do anything. In a way, you'd be preventing many more students from participating in these activities. Some students may of had mostly B' s and their average was brought down by just one bad grade.

Also, sports and other activities aren't always the reason why some students have a lower grade average. They may be under a lot of stress or have troubles at home. The activities actually might help them calm down a little. Those are the reasons why I think you should not change the policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. Thank you, and I hope you take these ideas into consideration.

I don't think that changing the grade point average you must have in order to participate in sports is a very good idea. I think that if a student is passing all of their classes, then they should be able to participate in sports. If a student was amazing at volleyball and that was the only thing she talked about, then received a 79 grade point average and was told that she wasn't allowed to participate in volleyball would be crushed. If a student receives a 70 grade point average or above, they should be able to play sports. If over half of the students on a team had a C grade point average, then the policy was changed, the school would lose over half of its students! How would you expect the team to play with less then half of its players?

I believe that the policy is good where it is. If a student does receive a C average, then I would warn them that their grades are slipping, not tell them they can not do any extra curricular activities until they get their average up. I think that having a C average is not great, but it is also not horrible meaning the students should be able to participate in extra curricular activities. Also, if a student is not allowed to go to lets say art club, then they lose part of their time to catch up with friends that they don't see during school. Most of the time the students are to busy to talk with friends during school, and then they expect to talk to them when they have sports or extra curricular. If a student is removed from a team because they have a C average, the team could possibly loose their star player. If the volleyball team is 10 and 0, then their star player is removed, then their record could start becoming a lot worse.

Some students struggle academically, but they should not be banned from their sports because of it. Students should have a good average, but they shouldn't be forced to have a better average.

If a student always struggled in math but did great in all of their other subjects, then heard about the new policy and was told they couldn't play sports they would think its very unfair.

Students should be able to express their talents, even if its not academically. Some students will go all the way through school, kindergarten through college, then realize that they want to play sports. Students shouldn't be restrained from what they love to do just because they had a bad grade point average. I think that students should be able to play volleyball or participate in art club even if they have a C average. I think that the grade policy should stay as a B average.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
4E0B09BFA60D,"Many students in our school have a grade of C average. If the school policy is changed, and students are not allowed to participate in sports or other activities according to their grades, then most activities would have fewer participants. The difference in grades should not be the reason of being allowed to participate or not. The policy would not be fair to most students whether they're grades are a B or C average. School activities were created for fun and education. How could a student get an education in that activity if they are not allowed to participate?

Most students have different grades, some have higher grades, while others have lower grades. If only the students with higher grades are allowed to participate in sports or other activities, the students with lower grades would never be able to have any fun or learn additional skills. Their chances of getting a good education would decrease and some may even give up. Students who give up would not study or have any interest in school subjects and topics. When they grow older, life may become very difficult to them.

If all students in activities have a grade of B average or higher, although the class would be full of smarter students participating, it is better to have a variety of grade average students. Having a variety of different students is better for students with lower grades too. The students with lower grade averages can learn from higher grade average students. The higher grade students can help the students with lower grades and teach them in an easier way. The influence may even raise a grade C average student to a grade B average.

In conclusion, I once again state that the new school policy is not a good idea. If the policy is issued, then there will be no difference in having the higher grade average students attend a private school, and the lower grade students attend a regular school.

I believe for a student to have a B average should be able to participate in school sports or in other school activities is a reasonable policy.

It is privilege to be able to participate in school sports and activities cause you learn more things that are useful in the future and help you gain physical strength on some levels. You also should keep this as a school policy because you shouldn't be able to participate if you are either failing a class or struggling to pass that class you need you won't be able to have any ability to do so in school sports and all. The student is just taking the class for nothing if he/she is failing just to be in a sport and that they don't care about their grade. He/she needs to keep a B average to be able to participate for that gain of socializing and gaining special abilities.

As I student myself think that I keep a pretty good grade average and with my other students who are C averages students should also have help keeping a B average. I would love to start a tutoring club to help them, but some students may just be to stubborn to admit they need help then that will lead to the kicking off the team or club. So, I think we should urge students to come if they need help or at least want to stay on the team or club.

Thank you for listening to my reason of who you should make that a school policy. I am all for your decision. Have a nice day and thanks again.

I think that it is fair for students who would like to join sports to have a grade B average. If students didn't have that rule then they could go around with f' s and still be in sports. The student wouldn't have to do any work and they would still be able to play. It's like rewarding a criminal for robbing a bank. This policy is a great idea it will help students to pay attention and get good grades if the would like to be in sports.

Some students who would like to join sports don't always have the best grades, but this rule inspires students to do their best to get their grades up to par.

For example my grades aren't the best, but i want to join track. I would have to raise up my grades and keep them that way to join the team.

This is the best policy the school could have for sports. It gives goals to kids who struggle with grades. This policy could help a school that has kids struggling in every subject momentum to raise up their grade.

For the students who have a grade C average they have the mind setting to raise up their grades. For the students who have a grade D average or lower it may be hard but it would be worth it if they love sports that much.

I think the possible policy change of students not participating in sports or other activities unless they have a B average is not fair. I don't think its fair because students try really hard sometimes on keeping their grades up and not down. sometimes the students don't deserve the grade they get because the teachers make mistakes sometimes and give you a bad grade when you really don't deserve that grade. Like for example if you did your homework and you give it to the teacher the next day then the teacher puts it away when she collects everybodys homework. Then after she tells you to give her your homework but you already did,so you tell her that you already gave it to her but she doesn't believe you so she just gives you a 0 for your work. And i don't think that's fair because a lot of students work very hard on their homework,sometimes they even stay up late doing their homework just bacause they don't want a bad grade on it. Also I don't think its fair because you cant just keep everybody from playing sports or doing activities because that's one way everybody can have fun and entertain themselves. Sports and doing activities are a good way to keep you from getting bored. Their also a part of school so they involve gym and doing exercise. Last I would like to say that I relly don't think that's a way to solve everything. I think you should come up with a better plan than this .A lot of the students might get very mad or dissapointed to hear the new policy that you guys are coming up with.

To raise the grades for sport participation to a B average is not a good idea. I mean I make good grades but not all ""JOCKS"" do and that's why they are what they are. It is very hard to keep good grades and win for our school. If you change the grade requirement, the sports participant numbers will indeed decrease rapidly. The students I'm sure work as hard as they can and strive to work, but if you take the only thing that keeps them moving in school it won't be a pretty sight.

As I said the sports team number will decrease, just take one look at all the football, basketball and softball players grades and a lot more than half of them are right at a C average or below it. You also have to think about the parents, they are going to be outrage. Some parents live for their children getting a sports scholarship, do we really want parents complaining?

You also have to think about the time consumption of practices and games after school. Most of the students could be under average because of homework and homework alone. If you were to give sports players test they would most likely do a bit better than the other students because they know the material but like i said homework counts a lot. I mean you cant do homework on the sidelines and if you can focus with all the fans and the screaming than this doesn't apply to you anyway.

The students at this school are great students but they just have a lot on their plate. Just take a few more days to consider the high price and how much you have to lose on this bet and I know you will reconsider, because we are looking for what's better for the school as a whole.

Many students try their best in school, but they just can't get it right.

I believe that a grade C average is still passing, so therefore they should be able to play a sport or participate in activities.

If a student tries their best and works for success they should be able to participate in after school activities at their school.

If they are failing they should focus on academics first instead of after school activities or sports. A grade C average is still passing so they should be able to participate in after school activities.

If you had to have a grade B average to play or participate in activities many people wouldn't be able to join, so our school would need players to be in a sports team.

I think you are being unfair to these students that try to be successful by not letting them participate in school activities or sports.

Also they can get pulled out of one of their electives to go to tutoring classes.

I personally have a hard time coping with my homework and sports. practice does take a lot of time and energy, but kids don't always want to stay up all night study for a test or doing homework that isn't important to them. If they don't want to try then they can learn a better way then getting kicked off a team because they don't have a B average.

I think that teachers should limit the homework assignments to a reasonable amount. Students shouldn't have to spend all of their time doing homework and going straight to practice. Maybe if a teacher handed out packets that were always due at the end of the week and were graded for correctness students would try harder and not procrastinate till the last minute because they ""had a busy schedule last night."" Kids might even think that they're too stupid for playing sports because they might not remember plays that easily or know how to do a certain combination. Having a C average isn't that bad if you at least understand the content your supposed to, I have a B average and I still don't understand things perfectly or get good grades on all of my tests.

Seventh and eighth grades are very hard to keep up with all of the activities and schoolwork. When high school comes around I think that we should have a good idea of our schedules and when we should study or practice for the big game.

These sports are helpful. Some kids cant afford recreation sports. Then the school helps those kids and let them play. So those kids are healthy and active.

I defiantly consider that we should allow any grade kids play. They allow students to interact with friends and coaches.

Also when you play sports you find people on your team that you have stuff in command with. You could be like some quiet kid then you could have become good friends with some populars just because of sports.

Lastly I think we shouldn't leave out kids just because of their grades. School sports make you better at recreation sports. They make you better, faster, stronger. When you makes a mistake in a school sport you will learn from it and become better in your town's team.

I agree with the terms that to participate in sports and other activities, that you must have at least a grade B average. Although many students have a grade C average, I think it's best to follow through with this policy. It would help students in school, as well as make the teams and activities a more stricter, nicer team.

Students should have to have at least a grade B average to be on the school's sports teams or in any other activities. By doing this, the students at our school will be smarter and more mature. The student will have to wok very hard to achieve a grade B average and will have to study more. Tests scores will go up and because the students want such good grades that they will have to pay attention during class; therefore, the students won't act out in class, as well as the activities they are in. They will care about the team or club and do their best. I think the policy for having a grade B average to be on activities at the school should be a yes.

Students with a grade B average will be rounded quite well, for they will have the smarts, as well as the athletics. Everyone can make a grade B average, so this policy would not be unfair. It would challenge the students to do there best on every paper they turn in. The students would also learn new study skills, as well as fundamental organization skills that are needed in everyday life. If students could keep up with all their school stuff, study good, and keep good grades, then collage will be easier when it comes their time. It's proven that students that make the better grades do better in college and other activities, then the ones that make less decent grades.

To have the kids that are in clubs or on sports teams that have a grade B average or better, they will have more smarts to carry out plays better. If the quarter back on the football team doesn't have the right fundamentals down, then the quarterback is useless. Smarts also help in groups. For a student to have a grade B average, then they must have some type of leadership in them. So for a grade B average student to be in a club or something of that nature, then the group will have a better bonding. They will be able to work together and develop into a team or group. Brainstorming ideas for ways to help the community will be able to be organized and arranged neatly.

Having the students maintain an grade B average at our school is a policy that should be passed.

Helping the students think for themselves, giving them necessary elements in life, and keeping them well rounded; this is what the policy offers. I think that the policy should be passed. It helps kids grow to be better adults, as well as help them in other situations in life. By doing the policy, it enhancing our generation, as well as many to come. Instead of more and more kids just barely making the grades, they will work towards being the best student they could be.

I understand you think that we should maintain a B average, but it's easier said than done. many students have a hard time with certain things in class that bring their average down.

To tell you the truth, i think most of the things the students have trouble with will never turn up in our lives again. Another thing is that all of the teachers grade things differently, so it may throw off the averages by a little bit.

A C average is still a passing grade and i, for one, think that should be the cut-off. If not a C, than at least make it a B- because as well as encouraging my peers to do better, it will also give the school teams it will be proud of.

If a student who played a sport had to keep a B average through out the year would be just mean. Sports take up a lot of time during the day and the rest is just studying. I've wrestled before and a I kept a C average the entire time I wrestled to stay on the team and I worked hard for that C. The thought of having try to get a C average while trying to learn wrestling moves, football plays, basketball plays etc. It wouldn't be fare to the student playing sports.

Like with football you have to study the play book or your going to walk on the field and not know what to do. Then you get chewed out by the coach and probably get kicked off the team. With all that studying g we have to prioritize what you are going to do and for me sports comes first.

For the rest of the year i get As and Bs but during sports seasons Cs and Bs are what I get. You also have think about how much time you miss at school playing sports.

You can miss tests due to games, practices, and tournaments. Just don't higher the grade to a B.

The only way I think heightening the grade to a B is if you have an in school program where you can do homework and study during lunch or another class like study hall. Have a teacher sit in a class room and give the athletes their homework and things they need to study and let them do it. Its a very good very logical solution. Athletes can also do missed tests and projects in study hall if they don't have time at home.

Well the idea of having a B average is bad and good at the same time. the bad thing about it is that mostly all the good player of a sport usually get a C average which is mostly common. sometimes coaches get mad because they know with out that person the team will loose or the don't stand a chance toward anybody. most kids dedicate their life into sports and that's what you all need to understand that we hardly are into school stuff well that's what i have notice from the other kids because their more engage in the sport there are in. for example when i have a game coming up that all i can think about and also brag about to people that's constantly in my head, but i know regardless what the other kids think i know that school comes first because with out the grades i cant make it anywhere in the sports industry.

The good thing about having a B average shows that we are committed to both thing and can accomplish it. also you get to see how we want to pass to be in the sport so we have to push ourself into doing our best if we want it really bad. by that it might even make our school more recognizable in the district and shows our ownership toward our goal so it could also be a good idea if you think of it this way because i know yall want a brighter future for all the kids in school some of us my look at is a caring way because we see that the teachers want us to go some where in life. i guess one day we would look back as a good thing to maintain our grades in a certain way and maybe kids might start doing homework instead of doing bad thing after school and start listening in class. this might also make us try harder in what we want and the goals we are reaching for.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

I am a student athlete at this school and I think that it should stay at a C grade average. A C average is a passing grade and that is good enough to participate in a sport or any other extra curricular activity at school. The schools have been doing great in sports and other activities like in art competitions, chess club, math club, and science club. The skill level will probably drop in sports. There would be less players in a team due to grades. Teams might have to forfeit because their team doesn't have enough players or some schools might not even have a football, basketball, or volleyball team because there wouldn't be enough students to complete the team. The schools chances of ever winning a championship in any sport is very slim. Most of the athletes here aren't that bright in every subject. But the school can also help if they could tutor the kids who are failing or are close to failing a class. Many kids or teenagers don't rely on their knowledge to get into a Division 1 college, they use their talent, skills, and special gifts to get them their. But we also have to push our student athletes to exceed in everything they do.

AA51B5B5EF68,"I would like to tell you why it is okay to have a grade C average and why its okay to do other thongs.

One way that it's okay to have a C average is because there are some classes that are really difficult or they just don't understand it. One way that I think you should put your grade up is by asking the teacher for some help or just find a friends that could explain how to do the work. Another reason is just simply take notes or pay attention. I know that there are a lot of people that try to distract you just move away or ignore them. Some student just don't do well in school because they think it's cool to have bad grades, but it's not. One reason it's not okay to have bad grade is because next year when you try to play a sport that you like you won't be able to that's why try to do well in school. Another way that you do bad in school is because you have girls that you like or they might like you. One way that you both can do well in school is by helping each other. That's why you are relationship. Other reason why you do poorly in school is because your from other country.

Like me when I first moved from El Salvador I didn't know that much English, but I learned from going to school and pay attention on how they pronounced the words. This year I got to play the sport that I loved because I tried my best and paid attention. I am trying to keep it this way so that next year I could play the sport that I enjoy. You people should do the same so that we have more people playing sports then people out in the streets. I play soccer because I like it and I am good at it. I also play it because we play against other teams and scouts get to see you play. We hope to give the state of Missouri a championship win so that we have money for other sports that people could I enjoy. Like we could do a team of skateboarders and go to different place to skate.

I think if you do sports you will do better in school and have better grades.

I also think that my mom and family members helped me do well in school I think I could do better in school, but as long as I can play sports I think I'm alright

So students do well in school so that we can play sports, and maybe we could win championship so that scouts could watch us play and maybe we could become professional like I hope to do one day.

That's why I think we should all do well in school wouldn't you like to be know as someone who is a good person in schhol.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

I agree that you should change the school policy so that students should have a B average in order to participate in school activities. I think that it would be a nice change to help students get better grades. It would also help our school to be a better, smarter school. Students would also push themselves so they won't have to face being kicked off their team.

If students do not already have a B average then how can they keep up their grades when they are participating in activities? Students need to learn to organize their time between activities and schoolwork. So not only will they learn to organize their time better but they would also be getting better grades.

If you change the policy then many students will be willing to push themselves for better grades so they can participate in school activities. The students who are very dedicated to the sport or activity that they love would definitely push themselves for better grades. I believe that some of the students who participate in the activities at our school do not have a B average. Most likely because they are so dedicated to their sport that they forget about the schoolwork. If one of these students found out that you are changing the rule then they would change their attitude towards school so that they will not get kicked off their team.

Our school would be a smarted school if all the students participating in school activities all had B averages. There are a lot of students in our school's activities so if all of them had at least a B average that would be very impressive. We would not only be smart but look smart to other schools. Parent would want to send their children to out school. That would be pretty awesome.

I think it would be best if you changed the school policy to where all students need a B average in order to participate in sports. It could really help out our school and out students. Most kids will be doing better in school and would be better at organization. We could also change out schools image to other parents, kids, and schools.

Principle,

I disagree heavily with your idea to only allow the students to play sports if they have a B or higher on their grades. it is unfair and should never be approved. I cant believe that you, the principle of the school, are saying that kids aren't allowed to play sports if they don't have a good grade.

First of all for some kids, sports are all they've have. They may hope that they will be a professional sports athlete in the future. But because you say that the cant do what they love because they don't get good grades is just wrong. And I'm sure if pass this rule you will get a lot of unhappy calls from mad parents. Who knows, maybe parents will want you fired for what you have done. Now I think that rule would be really dumb, I mean so dumb, for real.

Also, since when did grades effect peoples ability to play sports? I'm not a fan of sports but i don't think that you cant play a certain sport just because your grades are low. Also, just not letting the kids who do bad do sports wont solve the low grade problems. Kids will still do bad because they are now mad because they cant do the sports they like.

The only thing that will improve the grade standard is if you either hope the kids realize that they need to get good grades, or get a bunch of new teachers that know how to teach the kids. Both of which will be very hard to do

You may be risking your carer and the amount of students that will want to go to the school. And why would you want to risk that? do us a favor and don't pass this stupid rule. You aren't gong to improve the schools grade average, you are just going to annoy a lot of parents and students.

Other students, including me, would like to request that we do not want to have at least a grade B average just so we can participate in sports or other activities. We say that its not right to make a policy change, the way the policy is right now is just great, but the only suggestion is, to not make that new policy, for not all of us have the grades and we do not want it or need it. If the reason for changing the policy, is because of our C averages and below, is the problem, well there can be other kinds, and different arrangements. For an example, lunch tutoring, or after school tutoring can be the solution but by taking away our activities and sports just because we need more B averages, isn't the proper way. We need to have theses activities and sports so we can be more active and healthy.

To TEACHER_NAME:

February 15, 2011

I feel that the change in the requirements from C to B is a smart move.

Students on sports teams are oftentimes treated better than those not on the teams, and requiring them to do schoolwork on par with everyone else is a very good step to take. Our students have to aim to be the best.

If the students are forced to make B grade then they will be forced to study and do everything their fellow students must do, so we will finally be treating all of our students equally.

It's not hard to get a B average, athletes just simply don't get the grades because we aren't making them.

Students on sports teams oftentimes will only get a C because that is all that they shoot for.

They know they only need a C to do what they like, while everyone else gets B' s or A' s because that's what they need to do in order to achieve something.

Our Athletes need have the same standards our non-athletes have for themselves.

They need to go for A' s, and, failing that, need to achieve a B average.

Students need to aim for their best so that we, as a whole, can achieve more, even when they graduate.

In our school, athletes are oftentimes looked at as, ""They're fine getting a C, they're on the sports team.""

That is simply not the case.

If we let people with a C be fine just because they're on the sports team, what happens to our students who need to get A' s to appear ""acceptable.""

They need to get A' s to be good students, while athletes can get a C so long as they're on the team.

This is discrimination, quite honestly.

While not racial discrimination, this is discrimination based on the person's status of ""Athlete"" and ""Non-Athlete.""

Athletes oftentimes can easily achieve a B grade point average.

The reason they aren't is that they don't need to.

If they need to get a B, we may see a rise of A 's in addition to what surely would be a huge amount of B 's that they need.

We just need to make them need it, and they will get it.

It would be more effective than any other way you could increase their grades.

Students need to be pressured to make the grade.

The only problem is, how to implement the change.

The change needs to be implemented gradually, and at the beginning of a quarter.

If we implement it in the beginning, athletes will have the entire quarter to maintain their A or B average.

We also need to make it clear to both the teachers and the athletes that they need a B average.

We need to tell them before it happens, and remind them of it while they're still in class. The school needs to have a B average minimum for all of it's athletic teams.

The policy change is unfair and unhealthy for the children who do not hold a B average. This will make it difficult for them to stay in shape and to stay healthy. A lot of children stay in on there commuters, watch t. v and don't get the right amount of exercise. School activities make shore that these children get the amount of exercise to keep them at least healthy and active.

Yes, this policy might make children motivated to increase there average, but some children fiscally or mentally can not. This policy puts presser on these children and will most likely make them feel left out or that they have a low learning ability.

I do not feel that these consequences are necessary to get your point across. There are other ways to enhance the B average level that do not have consequences like these. You could require teachers to stay and work with the children who have a lower average than most separately from the rest of the children on certain times or days.

7EFA9BE7A23F,"I am against changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average because without sports or activities people are not going to stay healthy. I think it would be better if people could get at least a grade C average. A grade C average is still a good grade and its a passing grade. It only takes a C to continue on to high school or middle school. it is good to get a C or higher grade because it can give you knowledge and it also can get you into a good college.

If people get a C- or below they shouldn't be able to play sports or any other activities because school is more important then sports or activities. Also you have to be responsible to be in sports because you can not miss practice or be late to a game. And with education you have to be responsible as well because you have to do homework and turn in homework without being past the due date. If you are getting a C- or below that means you are lazy or irresponsible therefore you will be lazy or irresponsible in sports or any activities and because of bad grades in school i think they shouldn't let you play sports due to failing classes.

I do not agree with you in changing the school policy. People should at least get a C average in order to play sports. Even though school is more important you have to play sports or do activities in order to get in shape or stay in shape and you have to stay healthy. Sports is one way of staying fit and healthy. It is also good to be active and in order to be active you have to be in sports or do different activities.

Changing to that could be a good idea, except for the fact that a lot of kids might drop out and go to another.

It happened at my old school a lot, but another thing is being in sports will keep boys/girls grades up because they want to be in that extra activity.

I know this because it had happened to me i kept straight As year round because of that exact reason, I wanted to be in that subject.

But the reason it might be bad is because some kids just don't care about his/her grades they care about other things such as dating, sometimes drugs (rarely), and they also might have home issues causing them to not have good grades.

Not all kids can keep a grade average of Bs, they sometimes just aren't good learners, i wasn't a good learner in elementary but you cant make anyone smarter, my suggestion is to recommend a learning care system like Sylvan.

If you want that good of grades from every one then that must be one good school or your expecting to much from them.

I've never seen a school policy that says you cant do this unless you have a B or better at least a C or C+.

My look on it is either change to a C+ or don't change at all because most kids get Cs or better including my self.

Its your school so do what u like, but if you want students to be plentiful there don't change it at all, that's my recommendation and that's all i should really say.

I think that to be able to participate in school sports and other activities you shouldn't have to get a B average. Students not only need to be active to be healthy but it also supports brain function. And if you take that away to some people it could causes them harm.

I do agree with having at least a C average but if you change it to a B then lots of kids wouldn't be able to participate in sports maybe not that they aren't smart but that they made a mistake while doing a math problem or that they forgot to do their homework because their grandmas in the hospital and they were there all weekend and just didn't have time. C is average and there are lots of average people it doesn't mean their not smart it just means they aren't as smart as the brilliant people.

I think that the new policy on grades and sports is a great idea. Many students have a hard time at keeping their grades up while playing school activities. The new policy of having to have a B average to play is a great idea. There are many kids that have a C or lower average in one or more classes. To be good at sports I also think you should have good grades. To be able to get into a good college you must have good grades. So I think it is very important that kids keep B and A averages throughout grade school. If you are taking on the responsibility to play a school sport, you should be responsible to do all your school work and to try to get good grades.

Like for example i am good at sports but i cant do them because of my grades i got D' s. They should let you participate with at least D average. It only seems fair. When you cant do a sport because of your grades your letting your teammates down because you have to have a B average.

4223E5722166,"To the principle

I think that this is a good idea, but you could be a bit more lenient about the grade average that the students need to have. Instead of a B average it should something like a C or C+ average. Most students have a C average and most are already trying as hard as they can to achieve the grades that they currently get. Also if you lowered the grade average just a little bit the students would still trying to do better, for example if a student is getting D' s and F' s and the minimum grade that they can have is a C then they will be trying harder in school so they can play sports. Also the kids might be overwhelmed by all the school work and practice.

Most students have C averages and are trying as hard as they can, but if they were looking forward to playing a school sport and they had to have a B average then that student will probably not try harder either because they know that it would too much for them to handle or some people just have low self esteem. So if the grade average was a C' s then their self esteem will be raised because not only are they truly putting in as much effort as they can but they get to play the school sport they wanted to play and feel good about them selves.

Another thing is that if the grade average required was only a C and that student was getting D' s and F' s you would still be encouraging student to do better. If the grade average was a B and those students had D' s even if they tried harder the sport would probably end before the next marking period so they would not get to play that sport anyway. Or they simply might not try because they know that they will not be able to catch up in time for try outs.

Lastly the students might try harder but might get overwhelmed with all the school work and having to go to practice everyday so they would either not have time to do that work or forget they had to do it and then fall behind and get kicked off the team.

So i think i gave some pretty good reasons why the grade average should be lowered to a C average. I think that if you did that you would the perfect system. So change the grade average to a C so all the students who want to play sports can and feel good about them selves. Wouldn't you want to be able to do something you like maybe golf or even fishing, but you could because you were making enough profits at work that you knew that you could achieve?

I think that it is a bad idea to change the requirement to play sports to a B average because many kids that play sports have a average grade of C. Many kids in our school have a average grade C and I think that it is wrong to be able to take the privilege of playing sports away from them because a C average grade is passing in school. Many kids who play sports do not have enough time after school and practice to study for all there classes and finish there homework in one night and they try there hardest to keep up with kids who don't do sports but might only average a C in that class at that time. To pass a grade in most schools the average grade is a C, so to change our average grade requirement to a B would be unfair to students who only meet a average C grade in class's. Kids who play sports might miss class to go out of town for a game and might miss a test in class and have to make it up. But with the test there grade drops to and there average is below a B then they would not be able to participate in school sports so they would not be able to play in games to come and there would be no motivation to make up the test that they had missed to play the sport. Another reason that it would be a bad idea to change the average grade requirement to a B is because some kids try there hardest in school but only meat a C average but they also love to play a sport and you are not allowing them to play that sport because they are trying there hardest, so there would be no motivation to try there hardest in school anymore and there average grade would drop to less then a C average and would not be learning anything in there class's because they would no longer need to try to keep there grades up to play sports at school and that would ruin there chances of ever getting a good education because they would never try hard enough in school to maintain there grades because there would be no reward for trying there hardest. My last reason to not change the average grade requirement to a B is because kids who might be good at sports and not meat a B average might pay people to do there work for them or cheat on there tests in class, therefore they would not learn anything and when they go to a different school they continue there bad hobbits and not get anywhere in there life because they can not pass class's later on in life or get a good job in life. There is one more thing that I need to say about changing the average grade requirement to a B is because many kids can go on to be professional athletes but if they only get a average of a C and cannot get to there full potential they would never be able to fulfill there dream and never know what they could have been able to do. This is why I think it is not a good idea to change the average grade requirment to a B to play sports it should be left alone for the good of the student body.",5,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Hello, my name is STUDENT_NAME. I have heard about your change to make athletes have a B grade average to play. I must say I am very pleased to hear that. Most athletes are more worried about the next game or when practice is, and they are not focused on there school work. I am all for this change.

Most teenagers don't realize how important school is. They need to realize that most of them will not play professionally and should focus on their school work to insure they get a good job and have a nice life. Most athletes think that they are good enough to make it to the professional level, but most have other things happen. Middle school athletes should focus more on school work and not worry about sports so much.

Now I think that doing sports and after school programs is fun and I encourage it, but if it gets to the point to were they are fighting teachers to not give them homework because of the big game or the rehearsal then that has taken it to far and they should start focusing more on school work. School work should be done first and foremost. There should be an athlete or actor or whatever they do participating with a D or C average the should be in a classroom doing extra credit work.

Personally, most of the blame can fall on the coaches or leaders of a group. Students should be able to do their homework right after school and not have to go straight to practice. Why is there practice right after school most parents don't let there child do anything until their homework is done. Another option, there could also be a study hall for the students that have lower then a B grade average to work on there school work when they should be practicing.

I think that you should consider changing the average grade for a student to be able to play sports because most students in this school have a grade c average not b. Another reason why I think you should consider changing the average grade for a student to be able to play sports is because a lot of people would like to play the sport they like to play and be able to enjoy that time of their day. Another reason why I think this is because sports are a good way for kids to eczersize and when kids don't get the eczersize they need they will become unhealthy. Another reason why I think this is because when you have a team sport you need enough people to play in the team sport. For example for baseball you need atleast nine people on the field an if their are only eight the students that want to play that sport will not be able to so that is like a punishment to the people with a grade b average.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

I would like to say that the knew policy is outrages because almost every student in the school has a C or lower. and most play sports, including me and I have one C. with being on the football team all my tame mates want that new rule changed. less and less kids will go to school. more and more will be home schooled and our athletic coaches wont be getting paid a dime. your school might have the chance to be shut down also for kids not coming. and all the students would loose there activities like TSA, honor society, party's, JV sports teams, reading clubs. and other fun activities. parents too will be angry at you for doing this. if you are not pleased with the students grades to make them quite all these things. start a after school program and involves fun activities while students learn. and if you do this the students will talk poorly about you and all the staff. and be even worst then before. so please do not make this new policy because you will regret doing it and putting this school through it. so if you don't just make a new program and that's the best thing i can think of.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

The policy change in my opinion is unfair. Some students may love to play sports, or participate in music, or art. The change is not fair only to the students, but to the school too.

I agree that the students should have to work hard to be eligible for said reasons, but not every student is not entirely great at their academic studies. The overall grade average is a C, but now that it's a B, not all of the students can participate at the event for said reasons.

Sports is one of the biggest after school curricular, and it would be a shame for the majority of students to be ineligible for sports if their grade average is a C. Granted there might be some kids who don't really care about what grades they get, so in turn the student wouldn't be affected by removal of sports activities. But, on the other hand, there are other students that are so head-on about sports, and would be devastated if not eligible for sports. I myself know people that are very passionate about football, basketball, and mainly soccer, and they just can't be away from the sport.

Art is another big after school curricular. There are students that are so passionate about art, that it helps express what they feel, or what they think about inside. Art is a fun activity to do in school because, it's the students' chance to get away from any problems that they have in school, out of school, or anywhere else. Art cannot only be just a choice of after school curriculums, but a heads-on passion. I myself am very passionate about art, because one I'm good at it, and two it allows me to embrace my inner creativity, and show others what I'm capable of (art wise).

But the argument doesn't only stop at art or sports, this could affect kids who are in music. Music is another way for students to release any tensions, or express emotions, or thoughts. Passion is the main drive for kids in what they do, whether it be sports, or music. Kids are given the opportunity , and then it's soon taken away because of the policy. I know there might be some students who can attain a grade average of a B or even an A, but not all students would be able to maintain such a grade average.

Not only could this upset some students, but also some parents. If most of the students can only maintain a C average, then I'm sure some parents might be upset.

It is for these reasons, that I strongly disapprove of the new policy, and recommend that you should keep the policy the way it should be. Like I said before, passion is the main drive for kids in what they do. Don't take away what the students love to do.

EC1A91C83C2A,"Playing sports is a deal of fun. For example you get to spend time with your friends and play a good game. But if school gets in the way sometimes they collide so you should at least have a B average if your want to play a sport and represent your school. Here are my reasons why you should at least have a B average you should concentrate more on school and if you have bad grades your punishment is that you cant play your game until you get your grades up.

First and foremost you should concentrate more on school then sports. School is the most important thing in your life when your a kid because what you do now in school will affect you for the rest of your life. Five out of ten kids think that school is a joke and your there for nothing. What is more important sports or your future.

Second if you have accurate grades and your worried more about a game then school then your punishment should be not being able to play sports. Fifty out of one hundred students play sports and out of the fifty only twenty of them have good grades. This is a good punishment because playing sports is the least of your problems. The only thing that you should be worried about is what your going to do when you grow up.

Finally you should not be able to play sports if you don't have accurate grades because what happens when you don't have a job are you just going to play baseball in the backyard? So the question to ask yourself is what are you going to do when you grow up? The school is only doing this for one reason to better yourself in your future.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
C435A1D1C3D5,"Dear Madam,

In my opinions you should not change the school policy of having a B average to join sports.

We should keep it how it is.

Most kids in are school have those grades to get in sports and if you take it away, you may make the child not want to try anymore.

They will just say or think if I can't get a B or A what is the point of doing a sports.

But in a different case that would be a smart idea.

Not only you will make them try harder, you will make them think a little differently.

If they are a C student and you push them to get better grades they might think if I can get a B I can do better.

And you can turn them into a whole new person. They can walk away with a little self pride in them and a smile on there face.

So if I was you I would bump up the grade into a C+ and then later in time you can change it into a B then so on.

That will make the child say I am can't be a C student i can be something more in life.

And so with that little of a challenge can lead to something else. But I cant tell you how to do your job, that is just my opinion.

But I want you to think I'm not just doing this for me i am doing this for every kid that thinks they can only have a C in their grades.

It can go earthier way, it can go the bad way. Where the child thinks, he/she can't get passed a C or where the child says yes I can take that challenge and go for the sport.

But in this case the child might not want to. Because they are getting older and might think they can get somewhere in their life.

And may not need the sport or the B. But i am still against this policy I think it should stay at the C range.

The students don't need to worry about getting a B average.

I think its fair for you to have at least a B average to participate in any sports at school, because if the students participate in any sports activities there not going to want to do there work at school because they would be to focused on the sport than they would there school work they wouldn't get any of there work done. I think a B is good enough because you still passing.

i think school is way more important than sports, because with out school you wont have a good education, sports is good but that's not really going to get you anywhere in life. If a student really wants to participate in any sports activities and they have a C or lower they should do something about it and ask the teacher if they can do anything to improve there grades like extra credit.

That's what i did when i was on the wrestling team my coach was about to kick me off the team because my grades were dropping to C and D but i asked my teacher if i could do anything to fix it and they gave me all of my old test and class work i didn't do so well on and let me try everything again, i brought up most of my grades and my couch said it was good enough, if you really want something you should do whatever you can for you to succeed and to get what you need.

9FDBC2899F9D,"Dear Principal,

I believe that your idea is correct. Many students are not worrying about having good grades in school. Instead, they are worrying about their social life and their sports teams.

I personally play on 3 different sports teams and can easily maintain a B average. Many of my friends that are on my sports team do not care as long as they have a passing grade in school. They say that they should be focusing on sports instead of their school work. Really, it should be the other way around. School should always come before social life.

I believe that grades should be the main focus while you are in school. The reason for this is because grades are why we are in school, is to get educated. Are parents care enough about us to put us in school and give us a chance to go to college and get a career. Some students go to college to get recognized in sports. That, to me, is perfectly fine as long as they are doing good in school.

There are many advantages to having good grades in school. One advantage is that the variety of colleges or high schools you can choose from is much larger. If your GPA is low in high school or middle school, some schools and colleges will not accept your application. You could be stuck going to a community college.

These are all reasons for why i believe that our school policy should change and make their grade requirement be at least a B.      ",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
373F73E9E830,"Dear Principal,

I think that this new policy is generally a good idea. Many students feel that they need to focus more on their sports than on their schoolwork. If they are told they cannot be on a team unless they have good grades, it will encourage them to do better, let them focus on what they need to do, and learn to balance out their time. All are good skills to have in our lives.

First, this policy will encourage better grades and habits. Young people like being on a team and cooperating with others. If they need to do well in school for this to happen, all the better! Then, everyone gets what they want.

Next, it will apply focus in our lives. The youth of today are always being distracted by the technology we have created. In most cases, technology helps us achieve educational goals, but we cannot concentrate on school if we are listening to music, playing video games, or chatting on the social websites. Sports are important in our lives and we want to keep it like that.

My last reason is balance. Time is a wonderful thing to have, if used properly. Balancing our schedule out helps to keep us on the right track. This concept is arguable, but consistency in a person's young life helps with consistency in future jobs. Having time for schoolwork, sports, fun, and responsibilities is always a good thing and will keep teens on the track to where they want to be.

As I said before, all these concepts are arguable, but it is my belief that organization and balance is a good thing for us. This new policy would enforce that idea and give incentive for better habits. Whether it's used for encouragement, focus, or balancing time, it will help.

I don't think it is a good idea to not let kids exercise or play sports just because their average grade is lower than a B. It is obvious that some people have more brawn than brain and vice-versa. Me and many other students see it as an unfair decision and think that we should be able to play anyway. One person could get a scholarship because of their intellect while others might get something like a foot ball scholarship. It is very important to notice the differences between people even if the look alike.

I would like to know how came up with this idea, as it seems unjust to let this happen. Personally I don't play sports but I don't agree with this change and neither does the school board as they know that we need to have time to exercise and let our brains function properly, don't you agree. I would say if a child has a low grade than they may acquire a tutor to help them in specific class. But they may not be aloud to play sports if they cannot follow the rules or play fairly. I see this as a reasonable decision. I believe it would be in the schools best interest to put up a petition to see if your choice is allowed to be part of the school policy.

7E7BE5817CF8,"Students work extremely hard on their grades; they study, pay attention in class, and turn in their work on time. My Principal is wanting to change school policies to were only students with at least a grade B average can go to school events, but I am against that. Most students have a grade C average, and they've worked hard to get that. They study just as much as a student with a grade B average. Let me tell you the reasons why I am against changing the school policies.

First of all, students with a grade C average study exquisitely hard on their class work just as much as students with a grade B or A average. I think that it wouldn't be fair to them when a student studied exactly the same as a student with a higher grade average, and doesn't get the same reward. Most students participate the same as others and don't get treated the same way.

Additionally, some students can't remember as much information as other students. IN my opinion, students with a grade C average may study the same amount as students with a higher grade average. They just don't have the same memory strength; some students may have short term memory, but work hard to keep up the good work.

Lastly, students shouldn't be treated differently, because of their grade average. They shouldn't even be treated differently at all! The students with a grade C average are just as talented as others with a higher average. It would make the grade C average student think that they're not worth it. "" It"" as in not worth being rewarded with how much talent they put into their work.

To sum it up, all students with at least a grade C average should be able to participate in school events. They study and work as hard; also, they put in the same effort. Students shouldn't be treated differently on how smart they are, they should be treated on who they are, no matter if they have the lowest grade average in their group. In my opinion, students who put the same effort in their work as students with a higher grade average should be rewarded as the ""smarter"" students would be",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I am one of the athlete's of SCHOOL_NAME and I make wonderful grades. I understand that you would like for me and the rest of your future scholar to succeed. But, not every child in our school can succeed in that way. I have seen some of my fellow students report cards and C' s are very likely to see. But, there are also some students who could receive A' s and B' s in all of there classes. I think that you should only except A' s, B' s, and C' s.

Many students like myself, makes at least one C one their report card. The reason some of the scholars here at SCHOOL_NAME strive to make C' s on their report cards is so that they can participate in sports. Or maybe it's their way to escape from a broken home. ports could even help a child who always felt as if they couldn't do anything, actually come and at least try to do their work and try to learn. So as you see raising your standards could also affect others outside of school.

In today's society with all the gangs and violence we need to have more sports and active thing for us youth. I believe strongly that if are at least trying and staying out of trouble you should give us a lead way. The reason I feel so strongly about this is because, I used to be one of these student's who got in trouble. Until I put my ""bad habits"" into sports now I'm making better grades and I'm setting higher standards. So please just give us a chance to soar to excellence.

I understand that you expect your students to show good character and progress. I totally agree but on the same terms you want us scholars to have marvelous academic rates. But it's unremarkable, how well this school has changed we have all tried to succeed and put our greatest foot in front of us. So can you see how we have change our annotating skills and reading levels have sky rocketed and behavior has been better. I have learned so much my eighth grade year I'm almost to prepared for high school. So give us a chance.

Three main reasons why you shouldn't change school polices are that many students love playing sports and that might be the one thing they do to waste time. Another reason i will give you is that if you change the school policy ,instead of kids doing good things they will do bad things. My last and final reason is that students with out sports, because they have a 'c', would really be sad because all teenage boys cant live without sports.

If you change school policies students will not have something to waste time in. They are not going to be cleaning the rooms, the kitchen, the stove, they are not going to be gardening.

teenage boys live to play sports. It doesn't matter the sport they will still be playing something.

Another reason I listed above is if students are not playing a sport what are they going to be doing? For all we know they can be out in the real world doing drugs. Maybe you will see them on the news ""have you seen this student? He has killed a young girl""

I think that its a good idea to make sure students are passing all their classes with good grades in order for them to join any sports, but I also think that it would be better if you only did that with the kids that get in trouble constantly because I think that would keep the students from getting in trouble, and then when they stop getting in trouble then you could tell them that in order for them to join any sports they would have to be passing all their classes with a B or higher. After you have talked to those students and they still miss behave then you would have to take them out of the sport they wanted to be in. Once you take them out and they know your being serious about it then they will get good grades and behave so they can continue playing the sport they wanted to join.

You should also talk to the students that don't get in trouble because some are really good students and they still don't have good grades, but they really want to join a sport so maybe you can convince them to come to tutoring or to come get help after school, so that way they can have good grades and join the sport that they want to join.

I agree with you 50% because if a student has a low grade, and participates in school sports, their grades could drop even lower because they might not be able to finish their homework. The other 50% goes to: you should also let students know ahead of time when a sport is coming up, so they can get their grades up and be in the sport of their choice. I also think you should try that the parents should be able to say if their kids can be in sports if their grades are low; you probably wouldn't get as many complaints from parents and students that way.

I think that it would be hard to have a team sport because most of the students in the school have a grade of C or lower. For example: If RELATIVE_NAME had a C, and was close enough to a B, but couldn't get his grade raised by try outs. Don't you think you'd get a complaint from RELATIVE_NAME or his parents knowing that he was working so hard to raise his grade and was very close to a B, but still had a C? Because some students work so hard to get their grades raised so they can be in the sport, but sometimes they can't get them raised in time.

I think that it would be a good idea to also try to bring the grade down to a D because a C is still passing. If you lower the grade expectations then you'd have less complaint and more kids trying out for team sports. Also, I think it'd be hard for students to raise their grade in so little time without knowing in advance. For example: RELATIVE_NAME has a C and wants to tryout for cheerleading. She has a week to bring up her grade before try outs start; but the day of try outs she gets a bad grade on a test and drops her B back down to a C. Don't you think letting kids who did bring their grade up, but it dropped back down, participate in sports?

Another example is that RELATIVE_NAME had a B, she tried out and made it, but the next day was called into the principals office. He told her that her grade had dropped and she can't participate in that sport. Thinking about that; don't you think it'd be unfair to tell students that can't be in a sport once they've made it because of a silly bad grade on a test or paper or homework assignment? Think about how many hearts you could break, and how many kids could possibly hate you by the end of the year.

Many kids have been doing these sports for many, many years. Do you really want to tell someone they can't be in a sport due to a bad grade? Remember, it is a good idea, but it's also hard for students to keep a B average grade or bring up their grade. So, find different ideas on this, try them out and see which one works best.

Changing school policy is a big change for a school and changing it for the wrong reason can make it worse. I clearly state my opinion saying I do not support this decision, if a student doesn't make at least a B average in school doesn't mean he/she shouldn't participate in sports for the school. But i strongly agree that students have to pass at least two or more academic classes.

Making a C average isn't all that bad, as long as your passing you should be able to play sports. for example i have a friend named RELATIVE_NAME, RELATIVE_NAME's a good football player and a great basketball player too but he isn't all that great in class. RELATIVE_NAME is currently failing two classes out of his 4 academic class which would be Math, Language Arts, Social Studies and Science. His good, and the team needs him to bring home a championship this year for football like he did last year. but he cant play at the championship game we have next week Friday . all because of his grades.

something like that wouldn't help the school in sports. so RELATIVE_NAME decided to try and bring up his grade so he can play in the game. which would mean staying after school for extra help and coming in early in the morning for tutoring. He wasn't really a smart guy so he failed to bring up his grade and ended up not playing in the final game of his middle school year.

RELATIVE_NAME got so mad and angry that he didn't even want to do anything anymore, he dropped out of school and got hooked on drugs all because of one game of his final year in middle school.

So that decision of making students getting a B average inst really a good idea. because people's career can end and there are so many talented players in this school who can make this school proud of him and make them look back and say ""Oh that was a great kid"" so passing your class shouldn't be all that utter.

I hope my decision is taking into action.

First able i would like to know how you're doing, i hope you're doing well. I have been informed about a new policy in our school. This new policy will require for all student to have at least a grade B average to be able to participate in any sports or other school activities.

I consider this idea to be reasonable. I am pleased that you would actually consider this. I am in total favor of this new policy.

This may be the start of a perfect end to bad grades and behavior.

Students will start taking school more seriously knowing that there is a reward for them if they do so.

Although I support your decision, there is something that is bothering me a little. I think that for those students with a C average is not fair to not be able to enroll in any school activity. In my opinion a C average is not bad.

My suggestion is the following: Students with an A or B average will definitely be allowed to participate in any kind of school activity.

Students with a C average will be allowed to perform certain activities but not all. If they show improvement then they will be free to enjoy any activity they like.

I would like to thank you for your time. I hope that you consider my suggestion and realise the advantages and disadvantages. The fact that you want to pass this new school regulation proves that you are a caring principal that wants the best for her students. Please take care and thank you again.

Sincerely....

I think you're right on this the idea of this decision because if more kids spent they're time doing school work and planning ahead they're futures would probably be brighter and more obtainable. Not only would this motivate people to get their grades higher but it would also serve the experimental propose of seeing weather or not kids have to have a ""prize"" in order to increase their grades in school. I personally don't play much sports so this wouldn't effect me but I know of others who would be devastated by this new rule.

If this rule were to be in effect than I think many students would revolt at the idea especially in SCHOOL_NAME where most of the sport stars don't have the best marks. I think that this rule wouldn't really help anyone I mean people should want to get their grades up for themselves not because they want to play sports. I would have to disagree with this rule because it really favors no one and some people who get to play sports or do whatever they like in school enjoy school more and are motivated to excel.

If you really wanted to change things you should allow people to choose weather or not they want to take any physical activities. That would really allow students to dedicate their specific scholastic passions and generate better grades for themselves, their parents, and the school. In conclusion I think (and probably so do most of the other students) that not allowing students with a C average to try out or participate in sports is unfair and truly helps out no one and if enforced it would provide a negative unnecessary outcome for our school.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I just want to say if the average is got to be a B then if mostly all the jocks have C average there no one going to be playing because all the jocks are C average. But if you want to put it as B average then do it but i just want to let you know that if you do then mostly ass the good jock or whatever sport there good at they wont be playing until they bring the grade up to a B average.

Everyone likes sports but if you change the average then its not going to work out because all the good player are not going to be playing if you want the school to look bad but at the same time your trying to make it better for us but then all the slackers at the school. They will ruin it plus i don't want to go to a school that has a team at sports that are doing horrible at it i want this school to look good but at the same time look smart.

But i think it will work out either way it goes hopefully because this school great but you have too look in our shoes and be like we want win every sport but yet we have to have are grades up. So i really think its a good thing what your doing but at the same time no.

I think we should have like a vote on if we should have a rule of playing sports having a B average. What if non intelligent kids are not smart but they can play very good at sports like kids from other countries don't speak English and are not smart with English but they are good at sports but the really want to play but they don't have a good enough average.

So to be honest i don't think you should do that rule but at the same time i think its a great rule but some kids just wont out the effort in to have good grades.

I don't think it is right for you to change our school policy. Because students you are really good at playing sports should be allowed to play no matter what. Because they really work hard at doing their best to impress the coach and work hard at the sports they love.

I think you should consider the student that have at least one A, B, or C in class to play in school activities and to play school sports. Half the school students get at least a grade average of a ""C"" so why change if half the school is doing better. the other half is trying to their grades up gut some things get hard for some people. You should let the students play the sports because not all students are going to get a ""B"" average in school.

Every student should be given a chance in sports. To see what they can do and if there are behaving badly just pull them out of the sport they are playing. and tell them they cant play until next try-outs. And hopefully they will make the team those try-outs.

To be honest I don't like playing sports because I am really bad at sports well some of them i am good but most bad. so you wont be seeing me playing any sports, only the sports i like to play . but you really should let the students who have at least a ""c"" average to in the sports you say that's aloud to play at the right tome of the year.

Sports are a very important factor to many schools.

Many kids take sports for granted, and don't focus on their school work.

Our Principal is considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

I fully agree and support this idea.

Despite the fact that many students have a grade C or below average, this new policy would encourage students to do well in school so that they can participate in sports, more students in the school would have grades of B's and even A's, and the sports teams and activities would be smarter and more successful as a result.

Overall, a requirement of a B average to play sports would be beneficial to our school's community as a whole.

If a new rule is put into play requiring all students to have at least a B average to play sports, students with averages of C and below would be encouraged to bring their grade up.

For example, many of the athletes with averages below B would have a reason to bring their grade up, or else they won't be able to participate in the activity that they love.

All of the athletes would change their priorities so that school comes first.

This rule would encourage students to do better in school so that they can participate in the activities that they love.

They would have a goal of achieving a B average, and applying themselves to achieve that goal. Overall, a requirement of a B average to participate in sports and other activities would be logical to put into play because it encourages students to do well in school and bring their grades up.

From this new rule, more students would have A and B averages as a result.

With a requirement of a B average to participate in extracurricular activities, more students would have the goal of achieving a B average.

As a result, less students would be failing their courses do to lack of effort or time.

With more students with a higher average, the school would look better in terms of grades.

Now that their is a requirement of a B average to participate in sports, music, or another activity, the school would have much smarter students.

As a result, these students would be sent to better colleges.

This would make the school less known for its bad things, but more well-known for its high academic prestige.

This requirement would be the most reasonable choice because less students would be failing courses.

As a result of requiring a B average amongst students in order to participate in sports and other activities, the teams would be much smarter and more successful.

For example, the smarter students that earn a B average or even higher would use the knowledge that they learned in the classroom and apply it onto the field.

Instead of having sports teams that consisted of students who didn't make the right decisions and were failing out of their courses, the teams would consist of smart students who applied themselves to reach their goal of earning at least a B average in academics.

On the field, court, or rink, the sports team would be making much smarter plays, and ultimately becoming more successful.

The time has come to decide whether or not to make a requirement of a B average amongst students in order to participate in sports or other activities.

This requirement would be beneficial to our school's community because it would encourage students to do well in the classroom, more students would have a B or higher grade average, and the sports teams would be much smarter and more successful as a result.

So, Mr. Principal, go and make a requirement of a B or higher grade average in order to participate in sports or other activities!",5,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
EE440E670405,"Dear Principal,

Not being able to do sports or other activities if you don't have a B average or higher is not fair. What happens to the kids who do really well on other tasked, but when it comes to a project that they don't get, and they are to shy to ask for help. So the teacher gives them a bad grade and that brings their average down to a C, and lets say that they are really good at volleyball. It's the last day before the big game so you mean to tell me that the can't play in the big game because they got a C in a class because they didn't understand a project. Well if the coaches don't say anything i know i would.

Lets say we have UIL coming up and this actor gets a C in one of her classes, well for one she is not failing and two she is the main actor. You being in charge are going to take her out of the play and make her stay here because she has a C. That means you are willing to take a chance at getting a huge title and letting fall out of your hands because you took the main part way and handed it to someone else who has to learn her lines in less than one day because that girl couldn't come cause she had a C. That's just sad that you would waste a perfectly good title cause of one girls little mistake.

I also think that a C still deserves to be raised by letting that student have a chance to make up what they missed. By doing that they are still able to do what ever they singed up for and hopefully help out your school by winning something for you. I say that if that person has to suffer because of a C why not do something about the D,F, and other grades that seem to have no effect on those peoples lives while they work.

C5382404A84B,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that u must have at least a B average to play a sport or activity is a bad rule because if someone is in a more challenging class then it is harder for them to get a higher grad. Also maybe people need exercise and cant get it at home because they cant. Or they cant do any sport or activity because they cant afford it these are some tough times. Now just listen to me for a little bit as I back up those reasons.

Say if someone is in a level 1 class and are struggling in that class because level 1 classes are more difficult than level 2 classes. What if this person really wanted to try out but could not play because there grade is a C plus and need a B average to play on the sport team that they wanted to play on. And what if another kid had straight A' s but could not play on a team because they had one C then they couldn't play on that team.

TEACHER_NAME what if there was a walking club at school and someone wanted to join the club because they needed to exercise. And that person really didn't want to get mad fun of anymore because they would get made fun of because they were big and lazy and they only had one bad grade and they couldn't do that just because they have one bad grade. So for my second reason that you have to have at least a B average.

And lastly for my last reason say someone wasn't the richest person in town and could afford for their child to play on a recreational team so they wanted to play on a school team. But had one or two horrible grades and couldn't play who knows he could be really good. and finally that was my last reason for a child to play on a sports team or activity but must maintain a B average .

Again i think that it is a terrible rule for a child to play on a team or activity and must maintain a B average.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

Dear Principal,

I think that changing the grade C average to a grade B average is not a good idea because most students have a grade C average and they would not get to play sports. Also students wont be able to participate in any other after school activities like the Drama Club. So if they change the grade point average most students wont be able to play sports or be in any other school activity. Also they may not have that many people on a team to play sports because a lot of sports need a lot of players on their team like baseball or football.

So why would you want to change the school policy to a higher grade point average when children are already struggling with the original grade average? In my opinion your just keeping students from doing what they love. I know i would not like being told that I couldn't be in a sport or activity because of my grade average wasn't high enough when I am trying my hardest to keep it up to where its at. That would be very disappointing to me when I am struggling to keep my grades up and all of sudden I cant be in a certain sport or activity I really want to be in. So before you decide to change the grade average think about how students are going to feel and how they are going to react to it. I can guarantee they will not like it all. Thank you for your time and please think about your decision before you make one.

This letter is concerning your idea of a school policy of no sports or other activities unless you have a grade average of a B or higher. My view on this possible policy change is that it shouldn't happen. Many students have a C average and their only outlet is sports. Without being able to participate in sports they are going to turn to other things, and it's not going to be homework.

Sports play a vital role in student's lives whether they have an A average, a B average, or a C average. Grades are very important but so are sports. Kids my fellow students still need to be active no matter what. Without sports to do kids who are having problems at home or problems with their grades use sports as an outlet. It is something they can enjoy doing and helps them feel better. Why would you want to take that away from them?

Without sports students are going to start turning to something else. Drugs. Without sports as their outlet they need a new one and they are going to start hanging around the wrong kids. They are going to start slowly killing themselves from the use of cigarettes and other drugs. Do you want that happening?

You are the one who is always saying ""Stay active"" ""Don't do drugs"". By enforcing this new policy you are basically encouraging the opposite of those phrases. The kids who have a C average aren't going to be able to do sports and will find drugs as another outlet. So instead of trying to make things better by encouraging people to get their grades up so that they can do sports, your creating the opposite effect and making things much worse.

I strongly advise that you do not go forward with this policy because it is going to backfire very badly. I don't know about you but i do not want our school to be known as the drug school who doesn't support everyone getting active. That's not the title that SCHOOL_NAME deserves, but it will be if you enforce this new policy.

1F2DD4E07ECA,"For some students who are good at sports they find it difficult to keep a B average and still play that sport. Some students who are doing those sports may be in advanced classes and its harder for them to keep a B average. We use the C average be cause a C is average and anything higher is above average. Possibly some of the students who are in sports don't have a lot of time out of school to do their homework when they get out of school because of sports and that's what's causing them to have a C average.

It's for hard for some students to keep above a C average because of maybe problems at home with family, and that's keeping them from staying focused at school and they do sports or other activities to keep their mind off of the problems at home. Possibly they have been injured and was in the hospital for a week and came back and had a lot of makeup work to do and they could get it done in time and their grade was affected by this and that person wanted to be in a drama club after school.

I am against having a grade B average because i can't always keep a grade B average in all my classes. I wanted to try out for the basketball team this year but i couldn't because i had a D+ in social studies and right after try outs were over my grade was raised to a C.

Some of the best players on their team can only keep a C average and the school wouldn't want to cost that team the game because they changed it to a B average.

This is one of your students at your school. I have written this letter to inform you that you do not have to cancel all school sports. I think that you don't need to cancel it for all student. I think that you should have the audacity to tell everyone that the sports will not be able to be played by students that have anything below an A-C average. All student with an A, B, or a C average can play any sport they wanted to but every marking period they should have to show the coach's their progress report. All students should be able to show their progress reports to you, a teacher, or the coach. An other reason not to cancel the sports are so that all the students can stay in shape and not have any troubles with their weight. All the students should be able to participate in any after school program sport. All the students are able to play with each other.

EX: boys play with girls or girls play with boys.

All students should have a sport to keep them active for a while and not get distracted by any thing like walking around the class. All students should be active so they do not have to disturb the class with their need to let energy out of their system. ALL STUDENTS MAY PARTICIPATE IN VOLLEYBALL, BASEBALL, FOOTBALL, TENNIS, SOCCER, BAT MITTEN, BASKETBALL, TRACK, HOCKEY, ICE SKATING, ROLLER BLADING RACES, AND OTHER ACTIVITIES.

ANY STUDENT WHO WANTS TO PARTICIPATE SHOULD SIGN A PERMISSION SLIP AND SHOW THEIR REPORT CARDS. Students should not be all closed up with nothing to do they should at least have an hour of fun in their school day at least twice a week there should be 2-3 hours of out side time to let their energy all out of their systems.

If you raise the bar to play sports to a B grade average, almost half of the school will not be playing sports. Also I don't think that's a good idea because a student is bound to start lacking in school or sports.

I'm sure that you don't want to have a school full of kids that are going to get stressed out because they're trying to focus on school when really he or she is supposed to be practicing for a sport. Just think about it for a moment. You would be hurting many students dreams of becoming a famous sport player, but they can't because they did not have enough time as a child to practice. For instance, say their is a kid that is very talented in sports and has a strong chance of getting a scholarship. But the student grades are average.

Sadly, the student does not have a B average and can't participate in the sport that he wants to play. Now you would've ruined his chance of ever becoming a famous sport star.

Lastly, students will not be able to have fun in school. If you want a B grade point average you must work hard. That means sleepless night of studying. Do you want you're students to come to school dragging and falling asleep in class because they had practice and a lot of studying to do. But see why this could an good idea. For example, it may be a student that is a talented sport player, but all he want is a

C grade point average so that he could play sports. This means that student will not be trying as hard as he should.

Our school activities is a privilege to have. I agree that all students must contain a B average. What's the point of keeping the students after school if the cant keep their grades up?

I strongly believe that if they are struggling in their class work, then they need to be at home working on their homework. Once they show their coaches that they have improved on their class work, then they should get to be in their school activities. Athletes must have good grades to even be apart of the team, if they cant work hard enough on their school work , then they don't need to be on the team or apart of a group.

I can understand that they have C' s but they get help on their work so they can participate in the activities they want to be in. Education always come before anything else. I say that because when these students want to go to college but they cant maintain the grades for it, then they cant go. You may have all the talent in the world, but if your not passing your classes then what's the point of playing the sport? I believe you need to stress the fact that education is more important then other school activities.

I know when i want to play my sports, I always maintain a good grade average so i can participate. Plus, im not allowed to practice until my homework and studying is done. Im certain that most people believe in what I am telling you. Please take it in to consideration that students may not do other activities if they cant maintain a good grade average.

It would also help kids to learn the true value in trying to do something. I believe that kids should work for what they get these days. If they change the school average kids would try to slack in school and not try to do anything and that will not help anything. If you was to change the school average many students would probably leave the school and go to a different school. A reason for changing the school policy to a B average would be that kids try to just coast through school and don't try to do much in school. I think that this policy would be a good idea because kids don't do much these school years and changing school policy's would be just right for kids these days.

In my opinion, you should keep the grade requirement for grades how it is. Sometimes, what you're saying is true, kids need to focus more on school, but life isn't all about school, there are many life lessons that you can learn while playing sports, and to limit the opportunity for kids to learn these lessons wouldn't make any sense.

Sports teach us many thing, good work ethic, physical health, respect towards higher authorities, and many more. I, for one, was changed by sports drastically. At the beginning of basketball season, I didn't really have any concern for my grades. I slacked off, and my grades slowly started to slip a away. Until one day, my coach talked to me after practice, she was concerned that my grades would keep declining, until I could not longer play. This changed my attitude right around. Basketball means the world to me and not being able to play would make me feel like a failure at life and if that ever happened, I believe I would just give up and my grades would plummet. Basketball has also made me a hard worker. Not only did it help my grades, but it made me realize just how important hard work is. I made a connection one day, me and my friends worked hard at practice unlike some other girls, and me and my friends were the ones playing the whole entire game, I figured that situation is just like life, the people who work the hardest get the best deal in the end.

I understand though your concern on sports being a distraction to academics. There is a simple solution to this though that doesn't include limiting the people who can play. I think that you could just do as the wrestling coach does for all sports and make it so there is a homework time before practice starts. By doing this, there is no excuse for not getting homework done, and there is usually someone there who understands it if you need help.

Thank you for reading this. Hopefully you keep the requirements the same, for sports really are an important thing in life for many students here.

I think that it is a great idea that students should be required to have at least a B average in order to participate in extra curricular activities. This will motivate the students to do better in school, give them something positive to look forward to, and it would make the school look better.

If the students are required to have a B average this will motivate them to better in school. If they want to participate in sports and other activities, they will do better in school. In general, if a person really wants something, they will be willing to work for it. In this case, the students will be forced to keep watch on their grades. This will in turn give them a noticeable reward for their hard work.

This will also give students something positive to look forward to. 35% of all American students have negative influences around them when they leave school. So to come to a school and work for something, is a big thing for them. They will look forward to coming to school and getting something done to make a difference in their lives. I also think that this will lower the percent of drop outs in SCHOOL_NAME and help to make us a better community.

If you follow through with this choice, it will also make the school look better. You may ask, ""How so?"". Well as of now 45% of our students are failing at least 3 classes, and a recent survey shows that 95% of SCHOOL_NAME students like to play a sport and enjoy the activities held after school. If you require them to have a B average, they will get better grades in order to do what they want to do.

So to wrap things up, I think that requiring a B average of all students wanting to participate in any extra curricular activities is a great idea. After all, it will give students something positive to look forward to, it will motivate them to get better grades, and it will have a positive impact on our school. The way I look at it, everybody wins. You get a great school and the students get to grow up a little. I hope that you take this into consideration.

I know that we should at least have a B average when were playing sports but i think students still could at least have a c average.

The reason i think this is because sometimes it's hard to do sports and get a good grade.

Sometimes it not always be about the sports being involved it can be issues involving outside of the school for example family issues.

Maybe it could be even though were playing sports it could be that we try our best but we still don't get it but it's just too hard for people to understand.

But I still don't think that it's fair to take away sports because actually sports is good for us.

It gives us a boost to work harder because we just can't wait to go and do that sport.

Also I don't think that it is fair that the student's with a

B average get to play and we don't.

Another reason i think it's not fair is because then it would make students angry and they would probably start a petition or something close to that and start not doing their work and that would be bad for their education.

Another one of my reasons is what if one of the other outside activities involved helping charity and we had a C then in that situation would we still not be allowed to do that or in that kind of situation could we be allowed to do that outside activity with a C average and that was one question that i' m sure will get people thinking about and maybe want to consider not to change the grading average we would have to have in order to participate in sports.

Instead of changing the grading policy that we have to have for sports why couldn't we just change another rule for something else. Also and my last statement for letting us play sports even though we don't have a B average is because it helps the school and it helps the school by every time we hold an event and games we are help raising money for the school so we can by more technology an supplies to make the school better.

Them are all my reasons why I think she shouldn't change the rules on everyone should have a B average instead of just having a C or better.

Your idea of changing the school policy about having a grade B average, to participate in sports and other activities, I would have to agree with. For if you do the students of this school will surely keep their grades up and strive for excellence more then they do today. To have this new policy come in students will think twice about letting a C go by as a good grade. Also the students (because of this rule) will have a much better future than the students who think grades are a joke.

When you are a principal of a school of course you want the kids grades to go up if they already haven't. For it definitely brings up the schools grade point average making the school look much better for future students and parents.

Also today students don't really care about a bad grade. they would just toss their graded quiz paper aside and move on. While they really should fix their mistakes and get that paper turned back in for a better grade. Sure it would be nice to allow kids, who have a C in every subject, participate in an exciting sport or activity but the truth is that would really hurt their future. the reason it would hurt them is because if you allow them electives the will get a certain thought stuck in their head that they will live by and that is ""Hey I can get a lot of bad grades and I'm still invincible.

To allow this grand rule come the school will be a much better and smarter place then how it is now.

In SCHOOL_NAME grading policy for sports state that u need a least a 2.3 to play sports and i speak for the students when i say that it is unfair that we have to be the only school who has this policy that you are trying to pursue.

Have you noticed that if some of the great players out there in the world didn't have a least a B average wouldn't be pro athletes because well i cant guarantee some of those professional athletes out there failed school or had good grades in school. But if some of those guys/girls failed just look a them now playing a sport that they loved there whole life and getting paid good money for it.

My point is that maybe that could be one of us in this school not the people that failed school but the people that passed there classes with a least a C average or higher who went to the pros after high school or college. So don't punish those students who are currently having a high or low C average. Even SCHOOL_NAME is the best middle school with sports it would be just SCHOOL_NAME without sports.

Taking something a child loves away is like getting robbed at a bank it's not good. Believe me when i say taking sports away is like taking our first loves away.

I hope that i had some kind of positive way to change your my on your decision

79B8EB97260A,"Dear, TEACHER_NAME i believe that students of SCHOOL_NAME should be able to join the sports time with at least have an c average. my first reason on why i think that is because some students need's things to do after school. my second reason is that NOT all students can make an B average unless they really try. picture this one student by the name of drew brees enters SCHOOL_NAME he was the best qouiter back that ever stepped foot on SCHOOL_NAME he proudly walked up to the sign up sheet to sign up for the SCHOOL_NAME foot ball team but they quickly turned him away because he had an c average and an high one at that. that was the only thing drew had to do after school. this is why they atleast need an C average to attend sports and activities. my second reason was that some students cant really get an B average unless they tried. imagine this Sabrina was an student who only mad straight C on her reports card but she wanted to sign up for the step time they turned her away because she made straight C even though she tried. these are my reasons why i think students should atleast get an C average to get into any sports or any activates.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
A87882E3DD41,"I would like to begin telling you on my specific reasons of hating this subject, some kids need the exercise and can't get it anywhere else. It would probably raise each of the students grades considering the fact that most kids are overweight and need to lose it. Which would cause an academic change in their lives. Some kids may need help in their schoolwork but also need to fix their bodies. It is important to stay active or you can die young and not be able enough to think in class. If your son was sent to their licensed physician they would be lectured on saying that they are not staying active. Many things can happen if you don't stay healthy like lack of thinking and many other things like fatigue, nausea, weight gaining ,etc. I've learned many things over the years and its been hard but I've been working out more outside of school. Maybe you should allow all kids to workout in school no matter what their academic standards are. I think that your selfishness is bringing kids home to video games and not any sports thus making it harder for them to succeed in life. But the kids still need to get their grades up but imagine a star quarterback on a football team imagine he has no one or place to go to his life revolves around football he might get a scholarship to go to college but his grades are slipping and he has no money for a tutor, then what is he going to do. You should resign as a principal and see how it feels to have no money. You should take that into consideration. There should be a student council meeting with many of the football, basketball ,and soccer players and you should hear what they have to say according to this matter if you don't want to attend then what does that make you? I'll tell you what it makes you, it makes you a hypocritical coward considering the fact that you might have played sports when you were younger. When you used to play did you feel good playing or did you stay home. If you were poor i could see that it's hard living that way but you need to grow up and face life and grow mentally and physically. It could be the possibility of ADD . But I agree that kids still need to get their grades up but don't take away their fun.

The policy of having to have at least a grade B average to play sports has just been presented to the school. This idea of not allowing students to play sports unless they have a grade B average in my opinion is a good idea. This will show students that they need to work hard to do something they love to do. This will show discipline and regulation. In some ways this could also be a bad idea. Students can't play because of their grades and the teams will be small or there won't be any teams at all but, this is the price students have to pay to be able to compete in sports and have good grades.

First off this can show students that they need to worker harder. By making them have to meet a certain criteria can show that if you want to do something you have to work for it. This can demonstrate that in the future you have to be a hard worker to succeed in something you want to do. This can also help the student body in becoming a more intelligent group of people. This can boost test score and put more students into more advanced classes.

The second reason this can help the students is that there is regulation and discipline. To not work hard can show that there is consequences. In this case, the consequence is not be able to compete in sports. If the students are determined to play the sport they will harder and the consequence will be gone. This can also come back around having a school to having better test scores.

The last reason this is a good idea is that, if the school can't compete in certain sports because of small teams or even no teams at all will make the student work harder to compete. This can cause the school to lose sports and the students will not want that so they have to work harder to get the school's teams to become the best again. This can also help in the long run. All the students who compete in the sport will have to keep that grade up if they want to play.

In conclusion, this policy of students who play sports have to have a grade B average can help the school in many ways. It can boost the test scores by a large percent. The students will be determined to have a certain grade to play in sports. This will show discipline by demonstrating that if you don't work hard you can't do what you want. This can also boost test scores throughout the school and put more students in more advance classes. Overall this can help many things like grades and test scores. In my opinion this is a great way to help the students.",5,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

I agree with your thoughts on not letting students participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average. Many students get sidetracked when they are in sports because they are either thinking about them too much or they are excited about them. Often when we have our minds on something else we can't focus on our studies and later on it shows on our report cards.

Also, often when we are in a sport, we say we don't have enough time to work on our homework, and we blame it on the sport or activity. Moreover, you should use your new policy about the grade B average as an incentive to being allowed to join a sport or activity.

In my opinion, we often get excited about sports or other activities and get sidetracked when we are taking a test. In return, we fail the test and ask ourselves why? Even though we studied, we failed because our minds were in the world of sports.

Sometimes we can't even concentrate on our work because we are thinking of our after school activities. Adding to that, what if someone's grades are already low, to be exact, less than a grade B average? Having our minds on other activities could drastically drop our grades to the ground.

From my point of view, sports and other activities consume too much time, not leaving enough time for homework. Especially if we don't do our homework daily, we will find a way to blame it on the sport or activity, but still choose the sport over school work. In time, that will reflect on our grade and like always, we will say we didn't have time. If you change your policy to the grade B average, we will know we have to leave time for homework if we want to continue in any sport.

Lastly, the grade B average policy will work an incentive to us. It will be like an award for getting good grades throughout our school year. That way, we will stay focused on our studies to obtain what we really want to do, sports and activities. We will know we have to find the time to do our schoolwork if we want to continue participating in any sports. To sum it up, being allowed to participate in a sport will be a reward for our good grades.

Once again, from my opinion, no one should be allowed to participate in a sport or activity if we don't have at least a grade B average. Often being in a sport or after school can get us sidetracked from what is really important. Additionally, we won't find the time to do our homework and blame it on the activity. To add, instead of allowing everyone to participate in a sport, you should leave it and an award for good grades. To close, I agree with your grade B average policy, and I think you should put it to practice!

I don't think your new policy is fair. many students don't have

B average and it will take a lot for them to get there. If you change your policy, you will not have enough players for your teams. I think a C average is a better alternate. You can't expect students to maintain a B average for the whole year. It wouldn't be fair to the students or to the coaches. Some students aren't very good with their grades so they go to a sport to get away from that, it wont be fair to them if you make them maintain a B average or higher just so they can play. Many students have a C average and that should be good enough. Students have worked hard in order to get their teams where they are, don't take that away with a policy change. Students spent money on their equipment, if they don't get a B average or higher, it would have all been for nothing. Please take this letter into consideration. Thank You.

There is no need to change the school's policy so that students with a B average or above may be the only ones aloud to participate in sports and other school activities. Granted, students must keep up with their school work, but level of book smarts does not effect the qualities for sports or other activities.

Sports are based on levels of fitness, not brain activity. If a student excels in a sport, he or she should not be limited to access of achieving their goals in this sport because they are not at a high academic level. Limiting their ability to participate in what they excel in can take away many opportunities. For example, one of your students has the skill to play on a professional sports team, but unfortunately they are not allowed to participate in sports at school because they have a C average. A C average today in math class doesn't determine their future as a MVP.

Taking a student out of sports and other activities will not promise higher grades. Some students have learning disabilities that prevent them from learning to the standard that reaches a B average or above. Sports and other activities can stimulate the mind and actually help with learning. By allowing the students to participate in both sports and class they have a more likely chance to improve in both.

Many students have a C average in school. There is no statement that this is because sports or other activities are preventing a higher grade. It is possible that the students do not understand the topics as well because they are not being taught how they need to be taught.

I understand that one believes that by not allowing students to participate in sports or other activities will limit their focus to school work, therefore allowing more time towards education. Still, to live a healthy and well-rounded life, one must have the options to participate in activities other than school work.

Although you are considering the policy to chance, keeping the policy to allow any student participate in sports and other activities will permit them with chances of a better, well-rounded future. Think of the students futures above what they learn today and may not excel in.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I agree with you when you say that students need to have at least a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities. Sports are important to some kids, but there are other things that are important, particularly school. School is what takes you places in life. You can still get places without school, but you won't receive the benefits of better pay, an education, and many other things.

Sports are good for children. They get exercise, have fun, and learn lessons about being a team. I myself love sports and spend a lot of time practicing and playing sports. I don't think I would be allowed to continue to play sports if I had bad grades. My parents definitely wouldn't allow it and I don't think I would let myself play if I wasn't doing well in school. You definitely should change the policy so that students will know where their priorities will be.

If kids think that all they need to focus on his sports, then they are wrong. You probably aren't going to be a professional athlete considering the odds against you. You have a very slim chance and have to be amazing at the sport you play. If you do become a professional, then good for you, but it probably won't happen. This means that if you spend all of your time practicing and not working on schoolwork and then don't become a professional athlete, all that time will have been wasted and you will be behind almost all the students. You can still excel at the sport you play if you have good grades. I would definitely change the policy if I were you.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

My fellow schoolmates and I love to play sports. We play them all the time so we can get better and try out for the school's team. We have recently heard that you have been thinking about requiring all sports players considering trying out for the team to have above a ""B"" average. Well not all of us are happy about this, because it isn't that easy to maintain a ""B"" average for some people and it wouldn't be fair if that was the only reason holding us back from playing sports. Also making this decision would lower the amount of people trying out for the team, meaning we would have a less chance of having a good tem. And c'mon where's your school spirit.

Even though it is pertinent to your future to make good grades, and stay in school, you need some type of motivator to come and do well, and for some people that thing is sports. I feel you should keep the grade requirement down to a ""C"" average so we can stay active and off of the streets doing worse things than making C' s .

I STUDENT_NAME have yet again do agree with you. students should not be able to play sports or participate in other activities because we should not just come to school for any thing. We come to school to learn not just to do work to just get by. Many of you boys and girls play basketball, cheerlead, run track, play football ect... but lately have you looked at your grades. Teachers come to school early to teach and you should come to school to learn.

One reason i agree with the principal new policy is because students do not want to be in a class room and feel that they are not learning. In life its not just all about doing what you can to just get by. Bad graded on a report card is not success its also not a good thing to score low in a class or to just not want to learn period. Being dumb is not a good thing. Yes students should not be able to play in sports or be in other school activities if they have a c average if they can do good after school why cant they prove that during school hours.

In addiction, i do agree to the principal because why do so good at a game but not during the hours that you are at school. in my opinion i really do not think that if your graded are bad then you should not participate in all the after school activities, because you are just wasting your teachers time to come to school and teach you. we need to do our job so they can do there's.

Further more, i do agree to the principal new idea of not allowing students to play sports or participate in all of the after school activities because why come to school to take up space and to breath air. don't waste your time in the morning to come to school and do that. being in all the after school activities is not going to help you pass. keep in mind that do well in school can take you a lone way in the future.

Hence, i STUDENT_NAME does agree with the principal on not allowing students to participated in after school activities because teachers need to do there job and we do to, also there is no point in wasting time, if you can do good after school; do well were it really counts.

219BA92044F6,"I think that it would be good for the students especially for the ones who struggle. Students can be smart if they just would put courage into their work like I do. The principal is doing the right thing, maybe kids will try harder and give it all they got. I think that maybe if kids really want to do sports maybe they will think about their school work first. My parents always told me that if my grade was low i had to stay home and study after school and on weekends so that meant no running around with family or friends. That helped me though because I started passing my test. I just have that habit of going home do some study and homework and then going and doing what I enjoy most and that is riding my horse. Students would be more careful with their work if they knew they had to have a B average to play in any kind of sports.

The principal was smart for coming up with something like this. Our students wouldn't be where we are to today without our teachers, parents, and our principal. Thanks to them we are strong and independent people that we are. If i had to choose i would go with the B average because it would be a challenge for us. I am always looking for a challenge in anything I do because I know I can do it if I put my mind to it.

Some students would struggle but that's it they say hey i could careless and thats defiantly not the right to say at all. You want to believe you can do it not hey its just another day at school.

As you may know not many of us students like the idea of you wanting to change the schools policy were we can not play any sports unless we work harder to have at least a B average. I like your idea a lot and think its great that you want to do that. The reason why is because it will be a good way to get the students to want to do better in school. Most kids just play around and think that school is a joke when truly its not. The kids that really like to play the sports should want to try and get the good grades to play the sports. I truly think and believe in that. It is just that easy to keep the sport if you just do your best to keep in it. I would love for you to do the best you can to make that change. It will make our school a better environment. What would i do without the coolest principal here at this school. The students need to realize how important this opportunity is. They should learn to appreciate the fact that you are trying to do something good for our school. These students here don't understand how important it is. I just wish that the students will start agreeing with the change and start making better grades to make their parents happier. If they think about it, it will be better if we achieve that goal. Its really not that hard to do so.

I achieved my goals by making myself move forward and participate in the game. Like they say on ""High School Musical.""

8EDD5A7B2310,"I think that the students at the school shouldn't be off a team or not play sports with a grade B average in the school since most of the students in the school have C averages which means the teams would most likely be cut down by a large amount.

This now will show how this new rule will play on the students in the school and how they feel by this rule because at least half of the school would be off teams. And with it maybe half of the good people have a C average that means you lost you teams and you wouldn't have a good team and you would lose a lot of the matches.

The reason why this shouldn't be put into affect is because the school pretty much would leave the teams the good people would be off the teams and then people wouldn't have anything to do. And the people in the school must not like this new rule mostly because that most of the school don't have a B average only a C and then what would you do if people just started to leave. Then you would have to change the rule or else they would get a B get on a team and then they would have a C next test then they would be off the team, which means people wouldn't even want to try out anymore. And then you would still have no team which is even worse then the coaches have no jobs now your losing employees, and that's you way of making money.

Now the affect of this must be hard for the students because it would also affect there social life too because the way that most people meet them is by sports because if they are good they would talk and become friends. But now only the sport teams would have friends because everyone else would be alone, and with that it would take a while for people to finally talk to each other and one place to do that is during sport games or practices. And then you would make them feel lonely too which is even worse then not playing sports and if they don't have a phone and there friends are on the team you blocked communications too, and of course I could go on and on but I won't that my affect it had on the kids

And now the affect on your teachers is also a big thing because you won't have any one to work for you or even be a coach for that one team and then when people here about not having a coach they won't go to the school until there are good teachers at the school. And now what i think is the worst thing is if there are no people coming into the school then the last grade graduates and then no students so then you have to close down because, of that all and then you would have thought to yourself ""I should have lifted that one rule for sports"". And these are just SOME of the effects of it there can be many more that come along.

And now that I went through that whole thing can you please listen to the students and lift the rule and now that can happen and you know what will happen listen to ME. Now that you have read this I want you to take a good think of it and to now wonder what will happen to you now just think about it. And so I want to end this by saying thank you for listening and I will hope you make the right choice and lift it just think about all the other things that can happen to the school and then what you will be jobless. What would happen just think hard and long if you want to keep the rule or if you want to lift the rule thank you for reading this, i hope you will make the right decision and lift this rule once and for all.

You shouldn't cancel sports unless students have a grade B average. Student need physical activity after sitting down and writing for eight hours or more. Every student needs freedom for exercising or moving because trust these chairs are uncomfortable and it hurts our backs having to sit in them for more than 2 hours. So many students have so much energy that can't be contained in the class room.

Cancelling sports for students under a grade B average isn't very intelligent move because some try their hardest to get great grades. Students try and try but they just do as well as others putting in the same amount of effort, but getting higher grades. Instead of cancelling sport students under B average create a tutoring program and sign them up and this can help them get the grades they deserve.

As a principal you can create a program that will help students stay on the path and guarantee their success in school work and not just have them mess up because of issues that distract them. During lunch, free time, or something along those teachers can offer help for students who are willing to take it. Or the teachers and principal can create classes that need help in similar subjects and find times of a week to help the different, but don't give the class a name because some students would fell as if they are in special education or something along those lines.

Also many students would try harder jus to have a B average and that would help them get there grades up so they can play sports.

I feel that it is important for students to partake in sports even if they have a 'C' average. For me, and many others, sports are a way to help kids get at least 60 minutes of exercise a day which is the recommended amount by most pediatricians. Taking away the privilege to play sports, may take away their exercise and add to the growing problem of childhood obesity. Also this may not encourage students to improve their grades, but to give up entirely if they are no longer on a team. Further more a 'C' grade average is a passing grade as long as students are passing the class they should be allowed to play. Sports are also a social outlet for many. Their sports teammates are also, most of the time, their closest friends. Taking away sports for students could be like taking away their friends.

However I feel that education does take the priority over sports and other activities and should be taken seriously. There should be a required GPA to play on a sports team I feel that it should be lower then a 'B'. I feel that you should consider lowering the required grade to a 'C' or 70% and higher. But, if the parents of a 'C' average student feel the should not participate in sports then I feel that, that is their decision to make.

Students with a grade average of lower than a B should not be allowed to participate in sports or activities unless the activity could help the student obtain a higher grade average.

This is because students should be more focused on receiving the best education possible than playing sports or doing other activities.

This new policy would encourage students to bring up their grade average if it is below a B.

If he/she wants to do an activity that their friends are doing, but can't because their grade average is too low, they will have incentive to improve their grade so that they can participate.

If we don't establish this policy, students whose grades are below a B will be allowed to do the activities and will most likely continue with their bad habits (not doing homework, not studying for quizzes/tests, etc.) as the result of a lack of incentive to improve.

More students who are below a B need to realize how important their education is and improve their grade.

Also, not approving this plan would undermine good students who maintain an average a B or better.

if these students have friends that play sports and have averages worse than a B, they may realize that they don't need to be getting good grades in order to be rewarded.

These students may then begin to fall behind in class because they know that this won't disqualify them from intramural activities.

This new policy is needed to restore a feeling of purpose in students to get and maintain good grades in school.

98E785817634,"I do not think that requiring a B grade average to participate in after-school activities is a good idea because many students that have good skills in those after school activities may not be so good at the other classes they take.

If you limit the requirements that low then you won't get nearly enough people to have the activities and there would be no point in having them at all. If someone who was good at archery wasn't allowed into the team because of their average grade then that person wouldn't be able to go to the contest and get a chance at winning.

The students average grade in the core classes wouldn't necessarily be the same for other things that they do outside of school. Like if a student had a C average and was really good at football he wouldn't be allowed to participate which isn't too fair.

Also, if the idea is to get students to raise their grades, this isn't the best way. If they can do these kind of things outside of school then they won't care enough about it to bring their grade up for it.

Overall it wouldn't be a good idea because people who want to be on a team that they are good at wouldn't be able to do what they want because of their grade.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I think I am going to agree with you on that because i feel that school should be first over sports. For these reason: one students maybe really good at the sport they play and maybe someday would like to become professional, but if they had bad grades no school is going to want to except them. A second reason is that they should be more interested in thinking about passing the grade they our in that playing sports. My last reason is their future, they will get no where in life having bad grades like that.

My first reason being the fact that students maybe really good at the sports they play, but once that sport is over and they have all failing grades and will have to suffer the consequences of doing all kinds of make up work to boost their grades up. Then they will become behind and everything will all be a mess.

My second reason being that they shouldn't worry about the sport they are playing, they should worry about the grade they are in and being able to move to the next grade and be able to play the sport again next year knowing that they passed.

My last reason being that if students are in high school they should start to worry about their future and if they will be able to go to a good college and get a good job to support their family's. Not almost be failing classes over sports that they may not even be the best at. Now if they are maybe try and convince them that if they are failing being good at that sport doesn't mean anything.

I think your idea on making students have at least a grade B average to play sports is a good idea for many reasons. Doing this will motivate any sports player to do well in school. Also if students have a C in school they don't need any distractions from school because school is very important for your future career. So overall it is a very good idea and it is only to help the students in there future life. Good grades lead to a good future.

Also sports or activities are rewards. So why should we reward students that have bad grades with sports or activities. We should reward those who are doing well in school with the ability to play sports and do activities. We need to give everyone a great future life and career starting with a good education and good grades. If we don't allow those with bad grades to play sports then they can focus more on school and having higher grades and then be eligible to play sports or activities.

The schools top priority should be giving each and every student to have a great grade by educating them. Those who are getting good grades should be rewarded to show them that grades are very important. If we let students who do have bad grades play sports and there grade continues to drop that would look very bad on the schools part for rewarding its bad graded students.

I am STUDENT_NAME, an eighth grader at SCHOOL_NAME. I disagree with your plan to require a 'B' average in classes to participate in sports. Many students are smart and apply themselves, but do not fully understand subject material.

Do not think that they are not trying to get a good grade; They just need more help understanding the material. I know many very smart students who have difficulty with a certain subject. they care about getting a good grade, and want to do well. Not many of the se people play sports, but this new policy you have proposed will still affect them. Many students have a 'C', and they just need to get better help for that. I believe that doing sports helps a student get better grades, as they have a drive to continue, so as not to get kicked off their team. They will also have time to exercise and stretch while playing sports, which increases cardiovascular activity. You yourself said that ""The best way to prepare is to get your blood pumping through cardiovascular activity"".

Blood flow increases cognitive activity, which will help students achieve better grades because they will understand the subject matter better. Sports allow students to take a break from school and have some time with their friends. They will want to stay with their freinds, so they have another motive to try harder and get good grades.

I have heard that you are considering not allowing students on an athletic team participate if they have lower than a B. That is a horrible idea. The school budget is being voted down time after time and you are considering taking hundreds of dollars out of the schools biggest source of income? Money is not the only problem either.

When kids who care more about athletics than education have to keep their grades up they do try harder, that is true. But you can't expect these students to get nothing lower than a B. When these kids are kicked off the team for getting an above average grade they will give up on academics because they feel that they're hardest isn't good enough. If they had to get a C or above that would make more sense but to ask for all of these kids to get into honors while still participating in after school sports is absurd. Not only will this hurt the schools grade average, but it will hurt the schools wallet!

For some sports teams you have to pay over one hundred dollars. If you threaten to kick kids off the team if they don't get a grade that would be extremely hard to obtain, they won't pay hundreds of dollars if they even think there is a possibility of being kicked off the team before they have played a lot than they won't pay! It would make more sense to put a slightly lower grade that they have to meet because than the kids will see they have a bigger chance of reaching that goal. You are on the right track but don't go overboard!

A problem that seems to be making a lot of headlines these days is out of shape kids. If we want to have any positive effect on this problem, don't take the one thing standing in the way of kids becoming unhealthy away. RELATIVE_NAME, a doctor at the department of student welfare, had a comment to add,"" Kids who don't play sports don't exercise. That is being proven more and more as kids begin to think it is more fun to stay inside than to play outside."" To keep kids healthy you must preserve sports, the only thing motivating the, to stay active.

Grades will go down, students will become unhealthy, and the school will lose money. All of these will be the result of making sports harder to stay on. Don't make a healthy, intelligent school a failure because of a bad decision!

I do not think that changing the policy that consists of having a grade B average in order to participate in a school sport is a good idea for a couple of reasons. These reasons are how sports can help a student learn cooperation with others, how much work a student puts into doing their best in school already, and how a grade B average is very high for some particular students.

First, a school sport can teach students how to get along with each other and helps them understand the importance of teamwork. Having a school team sport can help improve friendship between the pupils of a school. This could lessen the amount of arguments and fights that go on between the children. Also, teamwork is shown here by depending on each other to achieve something that everybody wants. Another reason that this school policy should be changed in because of the amount of time and effort a student may put into their school work after arriving home from a game or practice.

After school practices for a school sport are very important because it helps improve the team, but school work is just as important. When a child arrives home from a practice, they put all of their effort into their schoolwork. If 4 teachers were to assign a test for their classes all on the same day, then a student coming home from a late practice would not have the time to prepare themselves for an entire test that will be taken the next day. The student on the school team may not get much sleep either, which would be due to the amount of homework and studying they may have. Also, a grade B average can be shown as a challenge for some students.

As a student may struggle in school, then they may have a challenge in hand for them if they would like to play a school sport. A child that may be struggling in a certain subject may not have it as easy as everyone else may. If this particular child were to go in for help and still does not understand the material, then they may get a lower grade than normal. A grade C average also is not a bad thing, because a C means that their grades are average, and they are not yet below average or failing the subject. Obviously, changing this school policy is a big change and may effect many students.

In conclusion, a change in the grade average is a horrible idea. First, students can learn cooperation from a sport. Secondly, a child may have no time to finish their assignments at home. Lastly, a grade B average is high and some students may not be able to reach that. In conclusion, changing this rule is a bad thought.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
7244EE88EFA3,"To the principal,

I think this is a good idea to help keep students working hard and trying their best, but i also have negative things to say.

I am going to start off by naming the negative reasons about this new policy. First of all, some children are actually trying and, maybe, can't get a higher grade than a C. If you punish children like that, what are they going to think of themselves? Their attitude could change from happy to maybe a little more sad or angry. They could push themselves so hard to try to get the subject, and a bad outcome could come out of it.

Now I am going to name the positives off. First of all, a lot of children, now days, think it is 'cool' to not do good in school, so this would strive them to make a greater effort so they could participate in the sports they play. I know for a fact, a lot of kids are not trying to their greatest efforts. Also this new policy would make our school look better because then most of the students here will have As, Bs, or maybe Cs. Maybe then, more students would come here because the parents would see what a great job all of the other students are doing and their son or daughter would also do a better job with their grades.

I personally think you should keep this new policy , but instead of a B average grade, make it a C average for the grade. If you put it to a C, then children would have to still work hard and make an effort, but they can still have one C her and there if they are having trouble with a lesson or subject. I think this is a great plan for our school, it would have teachers' attitudes become a little more positive thinking that their students are going to try harder now and will get better grades.

I believe that students with a grade C average and below should still be qualified to play sports and other activities. First of all, I think that the students applying for sports or other activities with a grade C average or below should be encouraged to get better grades in their classes, but not banned from sports completely. Secondly, sports have no association with academics. Sports can be played with education primarily based on that particular sport. Next, I believe that more students would be more physically active if more students were allowed to participate in sports. Lastly, I think that students have the ability to raise their grade while in sports or other activities and those activities could possibly encourage the students to raise their grade. In conclusion, I understand that you only want privileged students to play sports or other activities, but I disagree that students with at least a grade B average are allowed to play sports or other activities based on the reasons I have presented you and I strongly consider that you change the policy.

You are considering changing the school policy so only students with a grade B average or higher can participate in sports. I believe this is a good idea. Students should have to prove they are smart enough in the classroom to be rewarded with participating in school hosted sports or activities. If you agree to this new policy, many students already participating in the sport or activity will improve their grades to stay in the group. Changing the school's policy would prove that the school keeps standards high and that you give back to students who make good grades.

Students need to be able to prove that they are smart enough in the classroom to be rewarded with sports or clubs to join. Clubs and sports are extra-curricular activities and to join, you should not be failing any core class assigned to you by your school. Many groups a school will host are for providing a comfortable environment where you can make friends and learn something new, but not being able to learn what is necessary before hand proves you should not learn new information. Students should need to prove that they can pass a class to be rewarded with clubs and other activities to participate in.

Activating this new policy would force any students without a B average to work harder or stop participating in the activity. If you enforced this new policy, you would notice all the passing students and give them credit for all the excellent work they have produced. Any and all students, if they really cared about the activity, would try harder to keep or raise their standards, thus producing better grades. Activating this new policy is a great way to show the students what they are capable of doing and how to get there if they keep their grades high.

I believe this idea for making it a rule that having good grades will get you into sports activities is a fantastic idea and strongly hope that you apply it to our school. Many students would ttry harder and that is what school is al",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I STUDENT_NAME , don't think that having the students make a B average in order to play sports is a good thought.

Some students might be having trouble in math, science, social studies, etc.

If a student has all A' s in his/her class for the exception of math with a 75 average will they still be able to play?

If the student really love's to play a few of the sports the school offers for them why can't they play?

For instance, I myself is all pre-AP classes and am making all A' s and I can still play sports, but my friend RELATIVE_NAME's playing volleyball, basketball, and track she just doesn't understand math.

All her other subjects she gets A' s

She tries and tries to figure it out, but she can't.

RELATIVE_NAME goes to tutoring every morning, she asks me for help, but she still doesn't understand it.

Will she not be able to play sports what so ever?

Can ""WE"" the students of SCHOOL_NAME create a program where the students can get some kind of extra credit if we play sports?

If ""WE"" try really hard and get our grades up to at least an 80 average will ""WE"" still be able to play?

I will even help tutor some of the students I have to.

I think you are correct in saying that people aren't allowed to play sports without a B average.

Even though many students have a C average many students also have a B average or even higher.

If kids are barely passing without playing a sport how are they supposed to pass if they do play a sport. When people are getting a C average and playing more then the people getting an A as an average it isn't fair for the people working their hardest to get the A average. I think you should raise the mandatory grades to a B average.

The first reason is because if the people are barely passing when they aren't playing a sport how will they pass when they are playing a sport.

For example: since basketball practice takes over two hours after school how are the players supposed to do their homework without staying up till midnight, and if the kids stay up till midnight they won't be rested and won't do as good in school.

Another example is the day of a tennis match the players might have to be there for more than two hours as well.

The second reason is that even though a bunch of kids have C averages about the same number of kids have a B average or higher. Even though a C average has the most kids if you add the number of B average and the number of A average kids together you get about the same number of people.

The third reason is that it isn't fair to an person that worked their hardest to get a B average or higher to sit the bench to a person that slacked off and barely got a C average.

If you look at the starting five for the boys varsity basketball team their grade point average is lower than the bench's grade point average which isn't fair to the players on the bench.

For these reasons I believe you should raise the average to play sports to a B average. Most importantly if the kids are barely passing without playing a sport how will they pass playing a sport.

The second reason is that the number of students getting a B average or higher is about the same as the number of kids with a C average, and lastly it isn't fair to the kids that did their best to get a B average to sit the bench while people that slacked and got a C average play.

I am against the new policy change. I think that the new policy change witch states if students have lower than a grade B average that they may not participate in sports or other activities is not a good idea if most kids have a grade C average because then the school might not have enough kids to make a school football team or basketball or baseball or any other school team sports. If the school doesn't have enough kids to make a hole team then the kids that do meet the requirements of a grade B average wont be able to play on the school team. Also some kids that try there hardest might not be able to reach a grade B average in witch would result in them not being able to participate in sports or other activities even though the kids are trying as hard has they can.

I think that P.E. should be allowed to anyone even if they do not have a B in that area. P.E. is about having fun and exercising at the same time. If students have a C in that class, then it doesn't matter, its maybe because of not turning in their work. If you don't le student do P.E. then it could lead to obesity, not active in appearance and knowledge, and also in eating right too.

If you don't let student have P.E at school then it could led to obesity. Sure some students don't like P.E but at least they try to participate because teachers help them. students will think oh we have a C in P.E so we cant participate! Wrong, if they don't participate then what are they going to be doing they will be sitting down and just watching or doing work. Sitting down and not being active can be dangerous to you and your health.

If students don't do P.E then what are they going to do. Every student that are in Junior High Schools, at least have one period when they do P.E or some sort of activity. kids our age need to be active and energized because of all the amount of things we do in school and it gets stressful. if we don't have P.E all because of our grades then we wont be that active. P.E stands for physical education, not sitting down all day and doing work. being active allows students mind to be open and thinking because they have a break and able to get a break from learning. If students aren't active then they wont look good because of their weight and also the amount of learning they have been getting and no break. they will be weak and wont be able to think we will be like zombies, just staring of into space!

P.E is important for our minds to work.

P.E is also important in eating right. Kids will think that oh i have P.E at school i can pull of the extra pounds if i run. they don't realize what grade they have in that class. If they don't exercise in school then where else are they going to? once they get started on junk food they wont be able to stop. They will look bad, weigh more than they use to, and be more weaker. they wont be able to do it at school, all because they don't have a B in that class.

Although parents think that this idea is appropriate because, they think oh well my kid has soccer practice or basketball practice or they can play at nutrition by basketball or football, there is no problem he/she will get their exercise there. What they don't know is that student loose most of their weight at school, because of P.E, it does activities that you don't normally do at home or at a team. in school you do weight room, Frisbee, running, soccer, strength exercises. there are a lot of fun things that are fun and help you in your health.

I think that it is a good idea that you are only allowing people with a B average to be involved in sports. Its a good idea because students should earn the right to be in a sport or to be in a activity. I also think it will influence students who want to get involved in sports to pick their grade up to a B average or even higher. The reason I think this is because if someone really wants to be in a sport they would put in all their effort to be able to qualify, and get into the sport of their choice. I think the school should apply this rule to other school activities instead of allowing students with bad grades to be involved in activities witch people with good grades earned. Even though I agree with this rule I also think if you have a C average, but your just a few points away they should allow you to enroll in sports and activities. Overall i think this is a great new rule, and it will improve the school in academics and tests. This new rule will also change many students way of thinking and they will have a reason to raise up their grade and be more respectful towards the teachers, students, and even their parents. This new rule should be shared with schools all around California because it can change many student's lives. The new rule of only being able to be in school sports is you have a B average will have a big impact.

I have a negative feeling towards the new sports policy, If a student has grade lower than a B average they cannot compete in sports. The policy can do more harm than good. I think this an unjust policy.

Many students already have a C average on there report cards. If this policy were to come into effect the sports teams would be very small then our school will be wasting our budget on small teams. Another reason the school sports policy shouldn't be changed is, a C is a passing grade and students should not be punished for getting a passing grade! A third reason that the policy should stay the same is, students need exercise! With many students being unable to participate in school sports it makes them unable to exercise which leads to obesity. And an obese nation. A final reason the sports policy shouldn't come into effect is sports teach individuals teamwork and responsibility. Two necessary skills need in adulthood.

A possible compromise between you and the students of this middle school is to change the policy to If a student a has a final grade on there report card of a D or lower they then cannot participate in sports. Another Solution to this problem is, If a student has a more than four or five C averages on there final report card then they cant participate A final idea for the school sports policy is to suspend the student of sports for a couple of weeks.

As an Eighth Grade student I feel that sports should be allowed to all students. Knowing that the students usually get C' s, you should let them be included in sports. I think that kid's should get at least a B in classes, but saying they cannot participate in sports makes them feel left out. Some kids are better at academics than sports and others are better at athletics. By having students involved in sports, I think it will have them feel better about themselves. If they feel better about themselves, they can possibly get better grades. I feel an adjustment to the rule can be students can start with a C average but if they can't bring up their grade by the third week of sports, they should be kicked off of the team.

Students should also be allowed to participate in other activities such as Student Government, Writing Club, and Drama. Again, some students are amazing in these fields and they won't be able to prove that if they have lower than a B. I personally know many talented people who don't do a good job in school, but excel at music, writing, and art. I am not disagreeing with you that a good education is not important, but sports and activities can help kids get more out of school.

I also feel that these sports and activities can be an escape for some people. Some play football to let go of their anger and others write to express themselves. Personally, I play sports to relax and write music in a way to let all my feelings out on paper. I am not alone in doing this.

So it is widely known on the school that you are planning on changing the school policy so that only students with a grade B average will be able to participate in sports or any other activities. I don't know if you are aware or not, but their is a wide variety of students at our school that have only but a grade C average. It wouldn't be fair to those working hard to maintain a steady grade, even if it is difficult for them, because they want to play a sport or take part in an activity. Changing the school policy would only apply more pressure on students to do better in their academics. Some people would go to the extent and could make it, but school isn't always easy for everyone. For example, let's say a student who enjoys playing football is working hard to maintain his grade C average, even though algebra is difficult for him and the time he doesn't spend on the field practicing, he spends at home with a tutor. Now let's say you do end up changing the school policy, algebra is still going to be difficult, he might even need to spend more time with a tutor, and he's going to have to spend the time he would usually spend on the field, at home with the tutor. Some students might not even be able to meet those requirements, activities wouldn't be as full, there wouldn't be as many people playing sports.

On the other hand, this school policy change could help out students. Since the grade average requirement would be bumped up from a C to a B students are definitely going to have to work harder. This could help out on the school's overall academic scoring. There would be more B grades than C. Since students are willing to work up to a C grade average just to play sports or be involved in an activity, they would probably even work up to a B just for the privilege. Sometimes you may just have to give students something to work for, something to make the struggle worth while, and that prize in this case would be sports and any extracaricular activities. So in the long run, this may help out not just student's grades, but their self confidence in being able to set a goal for themselves, and reaching that goal through hard work and determination. Whatever choice you make, I'm sure our school would benefit from it either way.

To some students these activity's are their life's away from home, to some its the only reason they even come to school in the morning.

If you say that they must have a B average many will think that they can never get there and many will just quite before even trying. I understand where you are coming from thinking that this will just make the students try harder but many are already under pressure to keep there grades at a C and they will just break if you put this pressure on them . Maybe you could make it a C+ average that way yes the grade will come up but they wont seem like its to much pressure. Even just talking to these groups would do something telling them that they are leaders of this school and they need to lead by an example.

I think you are only looking at the bright side of things but think about if you do this and people just quite the teams and club then what are you going to do? What about those few smart kids who acutely care? Are you going to keep book club with one student? Are you going to have basketball team with 10 players? Or are you going to have to tell those few kids that you can't have these clubs and teams anymore just because you wanted to push the students a little farther. The students are already trying hard and they are pushing themselves but there is a limit to everything.

Please think this over before you decide about changing the policy. Students at this school need the after school activity's just because they aren't the best in the classroom doesn't mean you should take away the things they love. I fear if you do some students will just stop caring about school at all , then what would you do? You have no way to make them care again because guess what? If you take it away and they let their grades drop they will never care enough to get them back up even if you change the policy again. I hope you see our side of it to, I know basketball is my life right now and I don't know what i would do if you took that away from me because I have no where to run after this. My parents are done with me and so are my grandparents , this team really has turned in to mine and many others family away from home please don't take this away.

I believe that your possible new policy could really help the students who want to play sports also focus on their studies. I believe that some of the reasons that you should change the policy is, for one reason, the students can focus on their studies, for two, they can play sports and they also must make time for their studies as well as extracurricular activities such as sports and lastly, they will be able to focus on getting above a B average.

I am also a little against the idea because some gifted students in sports are not academically gifted. This wouldn't give them the opportunity to be as best they can be in sports if they focus upon the negatives of not being on the sports team they are on. If you change the policy, then some kids who are great at their sport won't be able to help their school win any sporting competitions.

While the kids can focus on their studies, they can make a larger and brighter future. Many students who have a C average can try to focus upon their studies and maybe even get above the B average. The students can be great at juggling their time for their future lives as adults. This policy can help the students be the best they can be in anything.

The B average,

I think is a little to high for some of my peers. Many don't focus upon their studies and teachers are time and time again to get them above their showing level of academics. Academics must have several students who try hard for their goal for whatever it is they want to do with their life. If somebody wants to be a millionaire, they have to work on being that throughout their life. Be a millionaire doesn't just come to you. You have to work your whole life for being this. If they want to be a hotdog man, a trash man, or even a McDonald's cashier, then they will have very little self-respect and very little low-self esteem.

I also oppose this policy because the students who wish to be a sports star must have good grades in College, but if they get below a B average in elementary, middle, or high school, then so what? the students try to juggle social and academics and if your grade skips a little bit, then they can't be on their team.

So, as you can see, I am of a spilt mind as to what I want you to do. I think that it would be both a great idea and bad idea, but whatever you choose, I am sure that it will be for the students best benefit and for the parents' as well.

Its wrong for you to change the policy because it will be hard to play sports or other activities and keep a B average. I know school work is more important than sports but sports in what I am trying to get a scholarship in.

I think we should just keep it as it is a C average to play sports and if we fail then its our faults not ours you can kick us off of the team or whatever until we get our grades back up. I think it would be easier in us just to keep it as C average i know life is hard and we have to learn but try to make it as less painful as possible.

If you want to change the rules than you can but you will be seeing a lot of athletes quitting because lack of getting that B average. I know you want us to do good in school and do good in sports and in school but its hard when we have to have a B average and get into shape for football, baseball, basketball. Etc.

You want only students with a grade average of at least a B to be able to play sports. Some students aren't good at, for an example, math so they might be getting say a C they are really good and love the sport.

Are you going to kick them off the team? Or say they can't play? They might not be the smartest in the class but why can't they play? Maybe they could get a touter but are you still going to say no if no improvements are made? Well think of it this way if you loved basketball and you were trying out for the team. You had made it but on your next report card you got an average of C. The coach says you can't play unless you get your grades to a B. So you get a touter. No improvements are made. None! You still have a C. You get kicked off. You feel horrible. So I am just asking if you let it be an average of C. Some students have difficulty learning I know I do.

I have heard that you have made a new rule, that any students that do not have a B average can not participate in any school activities, including sports, music and more. I fully believe that you are on the right track, students need to be able to keep up with there school work and activities. I think that if the student is passing the class they should be able to participate, not be able to, because they do not have a B average.

Most Junior High or High School kids may get a C or a D as long as they are not failing in the class and is doing pretty well I believe they should still be able to participate. If the student may get a C or a D they should be talked to or informed by a teacher to be warned they need to improve on there school work in order to participate in the school activities. Many students that are involved in sports and after school activities juggle them, school work, chores at home, and somewhere in there sleep. It is a big responsibility for some students, and may mean a lot to them. So if a student may get a C or a D on a couple of papers which will bring there grade down to a C they should still be able to attend whatever they may be interested in. As I said in the beginning of my letter, the student should still be notified about his or her grade and that they may need to find some extra credit to bring the grade up, or a tutor, or even just working harder!

I am glad you are listening to the views of the students to see what we have to say. Grades are very important, I just think it would be more fair if students could still attend the events unless they were not passing. I hope I have helped in some way, I really hope you understand what I had to say every student should be able to attend or participate in whatever they may like with out a failing grade.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
CBFBF31128DC,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

As a student at SCHOOL_NAME, I would like to say that the grade average to play in sports is much too unfair. many students who like to play sports have grade C average in their grades and we would lose more than half of the players on the sports teams. Therefore giving an unfair advantage to the other team. Now I think that we should at least keep the grade requirement to be a C average that way those who have a C average can stay on the team. Having the grade changed to a B average will not only frustrate students, but parents too. If parents are frustrated with the change then no one will be happy because you will get calls of frustration and the kids will be frustrated and have even more focus on the sport and not on school work. Trust me, take this from a kid who had been kicked off of the sports team because of bad grades. The grade requirement should be a C average and not a B average.

I agree one hundred percent that students should have equal balance between school work and sports. That is one of the many things college applicants look for when they choose who will go to the college of their choice. But is it really fair to make the students who have good grades be out numbered by the students on the other team who have bad grades? I think not. A C average would be much easier on the students because then we would have a fair play against other schools instead of being the only school who's grade average for sports is a B. This is also very frustrating for the parent to have to find out what they are going to do for getting their kid home at three o' clock when they are working and don't have any spare keys to the house.

If we have a C average then it will be easier for kids to keep their grades up because they will be scared to keep their grade at a C or below. since they want to keep playing and not have to worry about school work too much. It would also help to have more time for sports. like optional practice. If the athlete knows their parents are going to be a while coming to pick them up they should have the option to stay and practice after practice is through. Like an open gym kind of. I think this would be a great experience for the athlete and the parents.

I hope you will look at this letter and consider what I have asked from you. I do not want to make drastic changes in the grade requirement. just a little tweak to it.

I understand your concern for our grades, as standardized testing is coming up, but surely you think that stepping up our game academically will just put more pressure on our players? Play-offs are popping up, and our team is being worked hard to ensure that they make it to the championship bracket. A big band concert is also coming, and we need everyone on the team and in the band.

I'm not saying we don't need this new grading system. Many people on our team are putting off their assignments to do unrelated things (like watching TV). Can we put this into effect after play-offs? Surely our band will agree with this, as they have a concert in a few days.

Playing basketball gets adrenaline pumping through the system, clearing the mind and working faster. While this is mainly used for tactics in the game, a little adrenaline keeps the mind focused after the game. Considering most kids do their homework and study after everything else is finished, we could improve our homework and test grades using this adrenaline residue.

We also have to take into account the mood of the student body. If the kid doesn't want to do their homework, then they won't do their homework. If there is general carelessness, apathy, and depression among students, then it might be time to get some results out of other extracurricular programs. Maybe we should host a bake sale, everyone loves cookies.

I hope you take my letter into consideration, as I am eagerly cheering on our Panthers as we win games, listen with awe when the choir sings, and applaud with everyone else after the band's performance.

I agree with your statement about not letting students participate in sports unless they have a b average. One of the reasons i agree with you is because if students don't have good grades in school they could fail and they cant play any sports so it is really important that the athletes concentrate more in school and do all of their work. If you could get there coach to talk to them about there grades and how it could affect them and effect the team. But one thing i don't really like is that most students might have trouble with the material that they are learning in school so if the teachers see they are confused they should talk to them. If they need more help they should schedule something with the teachers that way they get more help and get a better grade but also have time to be in the sport they play. This is a great article telling students that play sports to get good grades. But also if they need help they should talk with the teachers or with you. If there are a lot of athletes that need help the teachers should host a program to help them out.

Another reason why i think taking away sports from people who don't have a B average is a bad idea is because for some students school is hard and most students don't get B averages a lot of students get a C averages and its harder for them to learn all different subjects when they already learned how to play all different sports.

I clearly agree with you. I do think that in order to participate in sports or other activities the students should have a C grade average because, I think that students should not let anything come across them and learning. Also because this lets us know that we are falling behind in our school work and its also warning us that we are either failing or barley passing.

Students should focus more on their future than on anything else. If they want to live in the streets its fine, but they warned them. They should be more aware of their knowledge and grades than anything. The sport and competitions, it doesn't matter if you loose or win, its just a game to begin with.

On the other hand, students should have the right to play whatever sport they like, but it's their grade and future, not ours. It's better to let them handle their stuff, and then maybe they'll know that something is wrong. Students should learn how to handle things and do things right. It will be affecting their grade, not anybody else's.

So I state my point, students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade C average.

If you change the policy so the students don't get to participate in sports or other activities the students will have a reason for not going to school. School is a place for social and enhanced learning. Kids get to have friends in school and with the sport activities it makes it easier to get friends. Friends are important for the learning process because friends help each other when they don't understand an assignment in school.

Student cant find any reason for coming to school if they don't find it interesting. They'll think its just a waste of time if they cant have fun. If the students don't go to school then schools will shut down and the mayor will get disappointed. Even though this will get their heads into studying more; other kids wont care. When the children who do work hard see that their friends don't care, they'll give up.

Students like having activities after doing hard work. Some kids try their best to succeed but the passing grade is just to high for them to reach. You shouldn't blame them for not having the ability to make progress by taking sports and other activities away. Some children cant even find help at home either because their parent don't speak English or their parent don't care whether their son/daughter get to be someone when they grow up.

I agree with your idea to keep students from playing sports unless they have a grade B average or higher. This idea, if carried through, will have a positive effect on the school for many reasons. These reasons include more discipline, and higher academic performance. Please make your idea a fact, and do not let students play sports unless they have at least a B grade.

Though the connection isn't as obvious as other reasons, student's discipline will in fact be improved. Students will want to pay more attention to their teachers so that they will get the higher grade and in turn, play sports. The fact is, that learning comes from listening. They couldn't get a higher grade if they did not learn. Also, students will be less inclined to act up. When a student distracts the class, nothing is being learned. Grades will have no chance to go up. The thought of not being able to play on the sports team is a great persuasion to many people. Finally, it is common knowledge that boys in middle and high schools are more likely to be ""cool"" if they participate in sports. Other students are always trying to mirror the popular people in hopes of becoming popular as well. If they suddenly see the popular kids listening and being good in school, it is likely that they will also copy that.

Higher academic performance should be strived for in all schools, but unfortunately, there will always be those few ""bad apples"" that can spoil the bunch. But there is always some sport that will interest people. Even those ""bad apples"". If they suddenly can't play there favorite sport anymore, then they will be prone to do almost whatever it takes to get back in. Even raise their grades. Secondly, sports can clash with homework. If a student that plays sports can not get their homework done after practice, then they have to make time. School can't be cut out, so sports must go for them. Playing on a team is a privileged, not a requirement. Finally, I have already said in my second paragraph that people try to copy the cool kids. That means that not only are the people who want to play sports going to get better grades, but so are the people who copy them.

Please make it so, and do not let any people who have lower than a B average play sports. My reasons are higher discipline in your school, and higher academic performance.

I think that students should get at least a grade be average to participate in school activities.

Since student should play sports to get more athletic, but should also learn to keep their grades good. Sometimes you get good at sports, but your grades can be slipping away, so I think you should let students participate in sport but schools first. This is how you should let students participate in sports or other activities, so school first, activities like sports second. Also having fun activities including sports or other games can wait, work on finishing school work or homework before activities. For students, they have to know how school is very important and can affect their future if they don't take it seriously.

activities like sports including football, baseball, basketball, or soccer are very athletic an fun activities to do, you need to earn good grades before doing any other activities. I know how many people like to enjoy a lot of outdoor activities that can is very important to maintain your health, but you should make sure the students are doing well in school before letting them play any sports. You can still let them play some after school activities that involve sports or in the class physical education that tries to get you to be more athletic.

I believe that students should a B average to participate in sports or any extra-curricular activities at school. If any of the students have less than a B average and they want to participate in sports, I think they should be given help in school, so they can get a B average.

The reason I support the idea of changing school policy regarding sports and activities is because I think that if students will participate, then they will not spend any time studying or paying any attention in school.

One of the most important reasons why a lot of students have low grades is sports. Some students believe that sports are more important than school. I believe that changing school policy would help bring grades up in our school. If a student with a GPA lower than 3.0 wants to participate in sports, then he/she will try harder in school, to get his/her GPA to 3.0 or higher.

We might lose some key players but if they cant get a B in college they don't play so its just preparing them for that.

I know that u have changed the requirements to do sports that your average has to be a B or higher, but I think that you should change it to C or higher, and I am going to list ,or give you some reasons to why I think you should change the average to do sports.

The first reason that I think you should change the average from B to C is because so many of the best athletes have a average of C and higher. But if you let them have an average of a C that would allow them to be apart of the team and allow there grades to become higher in order for them to stay on the team, or participate. That is one of the reasons why I as a student think you should change the average to do sports.

My second reason is because I wont everyone to have a chance to be active in the school sports, and if the average was B and higher only 1/3 of the students would be able to participate in the activities. I think that most of the students in the school average would come up at least for the season the are participating in because the have something that keeps them motivated so that they will either keep their grades up or bring them up.

And my last reason for why I think you should change the average is because I think that everyone deserves a chance to do what the wont ,and participate in what they want to do in their school. It is really important that a child enjoys the time that they are in school so that they want to go to school after the graduate from high school to further their education.

I think that you should change the policy to at least a grade c average, so more student can be in sports and that way the school can have more activity going on. I also think that all the students have a grade of D but they will change that to a C or more so they can be in sports or other activities. this students like to play and do activities i am not going to lied i have a grade C and i want to do some sport or activity but if you don't change the policy i think i just have to work harder than what i am doing.

most students get sad because they cant do sports because of their grade and some of them are my friends and i seen them change their grades up to an A

just for the sport and i think i will too but it will be a little easier for us if you just change it to a C average.

well that's what i think about that you should really listen to the student opinions about this policy well i have to go my time is almost up!!!

38D57197F5B3,"Well my idea on this subject is that yes i understand the need to get the grades to a B to play sports. I think tough, that because a C is an average grade that they should be allowed to play with a C average. Even though i wouldn't have a problem having high enough grades to play sports but what about the people who struggle just to stay on the team with a C average. The people who try there hardest to get that average but barley keep it. Those people should be able to play because they try there hardest to get those grades but cant get them any higher.

This year was my first season on a school team so I understood the threat of that limit. But i managed to keep my grades to all A' s and one B plus. If the principle were to change this may kids wouldn't try our would but be kicked off the team which I would be upset about because C is an average grade for students. Also many kids would have been scared and there grades might have dropped anyway because of the pressure they were under to keep them up.

I say that the principle shouldn't change this because sports is a good way to keep active, fit, and healthy as a young adult. I have played on a select baseball team for the last few years and our coach a made him have our teachers write down our grades and sign it. I have seen many C' s on these papers and our coach all ways says "" get those grades up or your off the team"". I know if i would get kicked off the team i probably wouldn't play sports again and wouldn't keep my self active and healthy like the way i am now. Hopefully i can stay this way for the rest of my life.

This all goes back to what i said about sports and kids playing them. The more kids play sports the more healthy and active they become. If our principle did change this than many kids wouldn't of played school sports and wouldn't be as healthy and active as if they had played that sport. So i encourage the principle to keep it at C average but urge kids to do better anyway because sports are fun and keep you active.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
E2669D67879F,"My Principal wants to change that we must have a B average to be in any sport. My opinion is No, because a student might not get a subject therefore that student has a lower average. It is also hard to maintain a B average when being in a sport because you are worried about both grades and that sport and also maybe things that are going on in your life.

But maintaining a B average can also help you. If you are in a sport, you say to yourself ""hey if I keep my grade to a B average, then i can stay in my sport. "" That to me is what helps most kids or teens that are in a sport . I could also see why my principal would change the grade is, because he/she has more students trying out for sports and also that he needs a good grading report from all of his students and half of his students are in a sport so that is why.

So therefore maintaining good grades would help a lot not just to the students but also to the school. More students need to pay more attention to school so they can be in sports. Sports is a great way for students to get a great education and to maybe someday get a scholarship to college. That would make me very happy if i got a scholarship to college from having great grades and for being in sport that is what i think would be best.

I have considered both points of view on the issue of changing the average grade for students participating in sports from a C to a B and feel that this would be an appropriate thing to do. Not only does having students at a C average mean that they are potentially lazy, but it indicates that if the student is willing to work for the team, they can show dedication to their schoolwork allowing them to become better students in the classroom.

On one hand, making all student athletes obtain a B average means that the student is not lazy. It shows that they work hard and want to achieve greatness in both their school and in their sports. Many children already are earning a B average on sporting teams at school, so why not make it mandatory for those other students to pick up the pace? This new rule wouldn't necessarily affect everybody on school sports teams, just the few that need an extra push. This is an excellent idea and should be proposed so that students don't get lazy and have only one main priority.

Additionally, this type of rule shows dedication to all students that working hard does indeed pay off. It gives student athletes something to strive for and something that will push them to work better. Making it mandatory for students participating in sports to have a B average or higher allows them to fully put their minds to both priorities. I know many people that feel they don't have to try as hard to do well in school because they just need a C average for sports. This type of mentality gets students nowhere later in life and will teach them to only do what is required. Having all student athletes obtain a B average shows dedication towards the athletes themselves.

In conclusion, making it mandatory for student participating in sports have a B average or higher is a smart thing to do not only in the minds of the faculty, but in the minds of the students themselves. I for one believe that this is a very bright idea and should be in affect rather soon. Having student athletes obtain a B average or higher ensures that the students are not lazy, and allows them to have goals and dedication towards the things they are doing. This is a superb idea and is a magnificent thing for the students, parents, and teachers.

Many students/kids are only interested in sports when they come to school. Probable why is because, they do not like learning or are unable to learn due to the lack of concentration. Others, may do horrible in school and play sports to make their parents proud. If you enjoy playing sports, he/she should keep their grades up. That should be a responsibility that every student should take upon themselves if they want to play any sport at school.

Many of those who intend on making or being on any team should have a copy of their progress/report cards with them. If they do not have at least a B average they shouldn't be allowed to try-out. Many coaches do not apply this to some of their players because they are excellent at playing that particular sport. The principal should take this into consideration.

If students are on any sport team and is failing or below a B average, there should be tutoring classes available. If they do not intend on going to the tutoring and getting the help so they can stay on the team, he/she should be kicked off the team due to their grades. This should go into consideration.

A large multiple of schools around the world have this as their priority in order to be on a team and get to be on the team for the whole season. This should go into action so that when these students graduate, they will have a good athletic record along with a good grade record.

Most of our schools students are very good at playing sports .But if they don't have Bs or higher grades what sense is there of having good sports players .Then our school will be known as the loosers in every sport because our good players aren't playing .That's why you should even drop the average to C's so that our good players could have a chance of being successful .

Sports and extracurricular activities are important to millions of adolescents around the world. For many, these activities keep them out of trouble, and help them occupy their time wisely. Therefore, maintaining a C average to participate in these activities pushes them to strive for their best grade in their classes so they can participate. However, I do not believe the grade point average requirement should be changed to a B average.

For many, a B average sounds mediocre. For others, a B average is one to celebrate. For some, it seems quite impossible. I do not think the grade point average requirement for sports and extracurricular activities should be changed, because not everyone is capable maintaining a B average. Everyone has different opportunities, strengths, and weaknesses. Therefore, I feel it is not share to hold kids to a standard that they may not be capable of reaching. Every child should try their hardest in school and strive for what they can achieve.

If the grade point average is changed, many adolescents may not be able to participate in activities that they would like to. This would put down many children, and they would get into more trouble because they don't have anything to occupy their time. A 2.00 average is considered "" average "", so if someone is doing average in school, I don't see it necessary to take their privilege of participating in sports or extracurricular activities away.

With that been said, a C average is not necessarily good for some students, because they are capable of doing better. If at all possible, a sports and extracurricular activity requirement for missing assignments could be put in place. This way, you can ensure that they are doing their best work with what they are capable of doing.

Please take my letter into consideration. If the average is changed from a 2.00 to a 3.00 many children will not be able to take part in their activities when they are doing the very best that they are able to do.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

Considering changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average is not a good idea. Changing the rule is not a good plan because most of the students have a C grade average.

A C is not a bad grade, C is considered average. I no most principles want there school to be the best but not everyone can be great. To meet the grade point average of a B is hard because most colleges grade point average is a C.I know colleges are a lot harder then middle school but are brains aren't as developed as the college students. Changing the average is not fair to us because we haven prepared to have to get a B if you want to do sports or other activities. If this was given to us in sixth grade we might have been able to do it but not on such short notice. It puts too much pressure on us students if we have to get a B average if we want to do out of school activities. If we don't get a B but a C are parents might get mad at us for no reason. A C is not the best of grades but it is not bad. If we have a C plus average in college you can play sports. Some people might have counter arguments like a C is not a good grade and if you study hard enough you can have a b average. But its middle school, if it was high school it would be okay. What if you have all B' s but one D? You would not be able to participate in any after school activities. All I am asking is to think before you change the rule.

3206079FDA69,"Dear Principal,

Changing the policy to having a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities is unfair. Many students may not be able to make a B average.

Sports and other activities give many students only a little time left to finish their homework and to study for test. If the policy changes then students will have to cram everything and have no time for anything else. Their lives would consist of only the sport and schoolwork. This would be highly bad for their health and could possibly make them feel angry and frustrated.

Another reason is that changing the policy could make a lot of people not be able to participate which will also hurt the team or group. If an important player could not make the game just because of getting something under a B average it would hurt the team and the outcome of the game. No school wants to lose every game.

A grade B average would also be to close of a call. If someone got a 79.4 that would average to a 79 which is only one point away. If someone was that close it would be unfair to him or her. A grade C average is reasonable because a C is technically passing, and it would allow students a better chance. Changing to a B average is to high of standards for someone who is so busy.

Also some people are just bad at schoolwork and can only manage a barely passing grade. Those people should not be excluded from anything just because they are not able to process information as well as some others.

Extra activities and sports are an important part in many students lives. It keeps students active and allows them to socialize with friends. If they were not allowed to participate because of a passing average (above 70) it could be devastating to them. For many people, they rely on sports to get them to college, and to get scholarships.

For some people sports help them lose their frustration and relax. Kind of like a cruise to get away from the world and to just concentrate on having fun.

Even though having good grades are important so is having fun and getting active. Changing the policy to a grade B average to be allowed to participate in sports of other activities is a horrible idea. Active activities should be encouraged not took away.

I am writing this letter in that the average grade for a sport or other activities should still be kept as a C grade average. Some people may think that a B grade average should be used for a student to participate on a sport team or in other activities. A B grade average is a average grade for a student while a C average grade is a passing grade for a class. If you would change the average grade for the students, you would be changing the child's life by not letting the child play a sport or participate in other activities with passing grades.

This policy change would make students lose interest in the idea of passing school to play on a sports team or participate in other activities if that student must have a B grade average. This would have more students drop out of high school because the student lost interest. On the other hand , this might give some students the motivation to pass their classes with a B grade average. This still may not be enough students to keep interest to pass school and participate on a sports team or in other activities.

I don't agree with you changing the school policy. Even if the students that have a C average. The students that have a C average should be able to participate in other activities and sports. they are not dumb, they are just good at other things or activity's but they are not that great at school. They should be able to participate so they don't have to suffer the consequence. also to be social and communicate with others. This is what i think about this topic:

They should be able to participate because so they don't have to pay the consequences.

They can just take their mind of the school work and have fun, interact with others. They may also change in how to become a better student, by the activity teacher giving them tips on how to be a good student, or the student realizing that he needs to change by doing better in school, and will learn how to change with their teachers advice.

The students that have a C average can talk with the students that have a B average and ask them for tips or even help them with H.W. they can be friends with them, they both can have questions for each other. It will help them become more social and a good student. they can actual get better grade's and be proud of themselves and not feel stupid.

The new ""possible"" policy change for the school, is ridiculous. You, being a principal, have the right to make choices that you think is right to make your school a better place. But, our grade point average for our school is a C average. If our students have a C average, and they play sports, what makes you think they'll have time to take up all their grades to a B, let alone a B average. If they can only keep a C average doing the sports they do now, they wont have any time to study.

Sports takes up a persons life. When your in a sport, especially if you love it, you have that sport as one of your top 5 things to focus on the most. Of course school comes first. But if the school doesn't have a award or record for having the best grades in the region or state, the school could get some awards or records for sports. Lets say if a student is in football. The sport is very time consuming. The practices are everyday right after school for at least 3 hours. A school day is at least 6 to 8 hours a day. Now add the extra 3 hours for the football practice onto that. These kids are gone from their homes for at least 12 hours everyday. Teachers give at least 2 hours of homework. Do you really think that the football students will have enough time to study, do 2 hours of homework when they get home from a 12 hour day? If you change the policy to a B average, our team may not have many players. Its like this with every sport. Plus sports always have extra things the player shave to go to. Like something to raise money, sell stuff, banquets, camp for the sport. So with these extra things within the sport, it takes up almost there whole life. On the weekends, they want time to relax and be with friends they don't get to see often. Their not going to want to be doing homework. Then they will have no life

If you change the policy, our school will not have a lot of teams. I know that's kind of rude but, its true. If a person isn't interested in sports, they might join another activity, like for example the drama club. The drama club may not have a lot of plays but they work on each one for about 3 moths each. They would have practice all the time and keep good grades. It's actually good their still trying to be in school activities. If you take that away by having some of them not being able to participate, then the whole play will be ruined. When your doing a play, you need EVERYONE. The actors, director, set designers, understudies, writers, helpers, everyone. Without everyone, like I said before, most likely they wont be able to do the play. And if they can, then they would probably make it until the last minute.

So as you see, many students disagree with this idea. Especially, the athletes and club members. Do you want to make a bad decision for your school? Because I know I wouldn't. What if you wont be able to take back the new policy? Then a lot of students and couches and directors and staff members would be disappointed. You would have ruined your school. So just think about it

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Good morning TEACHER_NAME. How are you ? Me ? Oh, I've been pretty good just trying to stay on top of school work to full fill my dreams.

So I heard about how you wanted to make sure everyone had a B average in order to play sports, well I have to say it is a very good idea, but I disagree that it's fair.

Some students may be really athletic and may not have a lot of intelligence. So I Disagree because of the fact, I Know what it's like to be behind on everything, and yet still be good at a sport, the sport is what made me keep trying my best in school, but sometimes, a student may have a bad day, and one bad day is all it takes in order to make the B go down to a C.

I agree we want the best for children, but sometimes children need a break, no ones perfect, and if they get the one thing that they are good at taken away, they might loose their patience for everything.

I Believe if the students trying their hardest and keep it above a C, then they should be able to play sports. Being active is something a person needs in life, and if they're to busy with their studies then they won't have time to get active.

A child needs to be able to plan there schedule out, including study time, and play time.

I also believe if you were to change the average that we wouldn't make as much money for SCHOOL_NAME because of the fact, students wont have a good average, which means they won't be able to try out for a sport, which means no money given to the funds from the child.

We need the best we can at SCHOOL_NAME, and change, it's just something we don't need.

I apologize if you don't agree with my words, but SCHOOL_NAME is doing great already. It's rated excellent, so why try to change it ?

I believe that children need sports to get that big test coming up off their mind, if they don't stress about it then they will have the opportunity to do well.

Take it from a child herself, just because we're young and careless, doesn't mean we don't want the best in life for ourselves.

People make mistakes, and you changing the average would be a big one.

I know a lot of cheerleaders and basketball players, who barely pass to stay in their sport, but when they're on that court, or on that field, etc, they look as happy as can be and they do a great job.

If you take the chance on having a good time in school, then students will start skipping, not wanting to go, and before you know it, we have 10x as many homeless people who could of had sports careers.

I'm not saying that every single student is going to fail if you make this a rule, but i promise you, students will stop coming and stop even trying to make something out of life because you took it away.

I'm only 13 myself, and I have been in a sport called High-Steppers'. It was the best thing I ever did in my life, I got fit, had fun, didn't have as much time on my hands as if I would if i wasn't in the sport.

Oh, and what about the fact that it takes up students time, and there's less of the chance of students experimenting with drugs, sexual content, and tobacco usage.

So as you can see, I have a lot of reasoning on why you shouldn't change the schools average for sports. I love SCHOOL_NAME just the way it is, and so do many others.

Well here is my argument and I hope you take time and think, actually think before you make any decisions. Have a great day.

This policy is unreasonable, it is because some kids that love sports only have a c average and are trying their hardest. Also when you take away sports and other activities from students, you are taking away their exercise. When you take away a students exercise you could make them have a risk of death. Also some kids might have a disorder that will keep them away from doing their work, and can only get a c average. And those kids with disorders might love sports or other activities, and you are keeping them away from that. Wouldn't you feel bad knowing you would be taking away something that other people love to do.

Also what could happen is that the people that can only get a c average could get mad or jealous at the people with a b average or better. So that would cause a lot of problems in school. There could be more fights then usual. Or people could just stop caring about their grades if they cant get better then a c average trying their hardest. This problem could get you fired because it wouldn't be a good school.

So say some kids at your school are having a rough time at home and the only thing that makes them happy is sports. But they only have a c average because of their home life. They wont be happy ever again if they cant do what they love.

What happens when a kid that has a b average, gets one bad grade and goes down to a c average in the middle of the season and is the best player?

Well I am against your consideration of changing the schools policy. It shouldn't matter if students have bad or good grades just to play sports. If you were to see or make a survey about students who play or participate in sports. You would surprise yourself to see that the average would have at least a C. Now Lets say you do change the policy all you would do would be take either their hobby, dream, entertainment away.

Many students she sports as a hobby. Which as usual they would do almost every day. Others would she it as there dream to be a famous football, soccer, baseball, basketball, etc. player. As for some other students use it ass entertainment to get their mind off of thing that bug them. And if i had to say so sometimes is because of their grades. Which most of the time it helps them a lot.

So I'm guessing you wouldn't want to change the school policy after all because it would really affect them. As I was saying students with bad grades sometimes there not so bad because either they have a C or a D. Which i think is better than having an F. Now your policy says ""unless they have at least a grade B average."" Most of the time students are close to a B, but their average is a C. Keep in consideration.

Now imagine it were to be you. Put yourself in your favorite sport, and pretend you were on your way to play as your coach comes by and says ""sorry you can't play cause you need a B average and all you have is a C average.""

Although this policy can be bad it can be good at the same time.

I would make the policy to have a 70% average so that you would need at least 5 points more than a passing grade.

As a student I know how difficult it is to keep your grades up and do extracurricular activities.

Students should be able to manage their time wisely.

It is their responsibility to spend enough time studying for tests and completing their homework.

However, if students weren't allowed to take part in sports because they had a C in a certain subject it might take their mind off of the work.

It could make them think more about how upset they are because they can't participate in sports.

I don't think that making students have a B grade average is very fair because some people complete all of their assignments and do what is asked of them, but they don't take tests well so therefore their grades are affected.

Students should have at least a C grade average because it is probably something more realistic to achieve for students that participate in sports.

The school policy could also be changed and maybe if children got a B grade average or above they could be rewarded instead of being punished for not achieving that goal.

Also I think that if many of the students have a C grade average the staff at the school should make sure that their students have completed their assignments.

Also, students should ask their teachers about topics they are struggling on so they have a better understanding of it.

Overall, taking sports away from students is unfair and just distracts them even more.

If students are given an award for their hard work I think they will strive more to achieve that goal.

Punishing people may get them to realize they need to manage their time more wisely, but it won't help them do better in school.

I also believe that sports is a way for people to take away the stress of school and other things.

Sports in a way are like therapy, and if you take that away it won't help them it will only hurt them.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I recently became aware of your plan of to change the schools policy on required GPA for sports and other activities. I would like to ask you to reconsider your plan. I am aware that you feel this will provide an incentive for students to work hard. However, I feel many students will struggle with this. Quite a few of our students try very hard and receive a C average. I feel that it would be unfair to punish those who try hard, but school doesn't come easily to them. Many students put in huge effort and receive a C. I feel that students with a C average should still be allowed to participate in school sports and activities.

Secondly, lowering the grade average to participate in school sports and activities could benefit many students. Many students stay out of trouble when they are participating in school activities. The time spent on wandering around empty homes is much shorter when students participate in school activities. Lowering the grade average to a C could help prevent many students from getting involved with trouble.

Lastly, I would like you to consider that a C is an average grade. I am not saying a C is a good grade but, it is the best some students can do. Some students don't receive the support at home and it shows in their work. We shouldn't penalize students for having average grades. We can work with students to help them raise their grades, but we should still allow them to participate in activities.

I as well as many students would greatly appreciate it if you made a C average the limit for participating in school activities.

Thank you for your consideration on this matter,

The student body is very upset with the change in the grading policy they just don't like the idea that if they don't having a B or higher in every class that they won't be able to participate in after school activities such as sports or student council. I understand what the school is trying to do by making students try to achieve a higher standard in grades, but this punishment for not having excellence in the grade books is totally out of line. For Example, some students my try their absolute hardest in the class but yet they don't make the best grades and you want to take away their spot on football team or spot on the student council for making an effort in school. I would like you to put yourself in our schools and see if this is unfair or not. Some of the students only way to express yourself is through the after school activities and you want to take that away from them because they didn't do well in English or another class. I work my best in school and see that a lot of the kids here do the same, but I ask you to consider maybe have the grade policy lower so that more people can have a chance to work and play in after school activities. I just ask on behalf of the student body to reconsider the grading policy to be lower so more kids have a chance to play sports or have fun in after school activities.

As a member of the student body, I would like to talk to you and express my feelings on you changing the policy to participate in sports or other activities to having a grade B average. Many of our student have a C average, and changing the policy would mean that they wouldn't be allowed to participate in sports or other activities. I think this policy would be unfair. Not only would we have smaller participation in sports activities, but also in school activities. Our sport's teams would fall in numbers and our school functions would be lame and boring, because attendance would be down. So why not change the policy to at least a grade C average? I think this would be more fair to all the students. It would push the students below a C average to achieve something more and improve their grade, and the students above a C average to maintain or slightly improve their grade.

Making the requirement a C average to participate in sports and school activities could also help our school to become academically sound. Making it a B average could do the opposite. Students who have C' s and D' s would feel discouraged and just give up there for dropping are school's average grades really low. We don't want this to happen, so instead of making it a B average let's make it a C average! Mr. Principal I sincerely hope you will take into consideration all that I have expressed to you.

I believe that getting physical activity is very important in a young adults life and should not be completely taken away from children during school hours. Being in a sport shows school spirit, keeps kids in shape, and give them some time to have fun. Studies show students who participate in sports and get regular physical activity do better in school.

Some kids have a hard time paying attention in class, or just have a hard time learning in general. I personally do not think that you should take away ALL sports privileges if a student shows effort in their work but is still not getting the grade needed to participate in a sport. Instead try talking to them about why they are struggling in class, and what you could do to help them ; or you could try making them sit out for a certain amount of games. This way you are still taking away the privilege but not making them stop playing the sport all together.

For many students it is hard to maintain a B average all year, in every class.

For some students, a sport allows them time to be with their friends, kind of like their social time. Although you should not spend the whole time standing around talking to a friend, for some students it is the only time they get to see them. Sports will also improve team work, and teach kids how to get along with each other and work as a team.

In conclusion I do not feel that taking away sports privileges from any student who has below a B average is a good idea. I hope you consider my thoughts on this topic.

Grades are very important now a days and should have a huge impact on our lives, but there's no reason that the school policy should be changed so that students with a B average can only play sports or be involved with activities. That should not be the schools decision to make this policy. If a student doesn't get good grades then let the student and the parent talk about weather or not that student should play sports, or be involved in other extra activities.

Many students, are very smart when it comes to getting grades.

Most sports coaches tell there participants that if they don't get good grades, or earn there good grades then they don't deserve to play on that team, because it's not fair to the other athletics that do work hard to get good grades. Student's may try as hard as they can in a classroom, and study as much as possible, but that doesn't mean there always going to get good grades. Some students don't have to study to get the good grades they get. Where with other kids they have to study, and study, and study and maybe still don't understand what there learning about.

In school, instead of having the extra activities go on during school hours, let the group meet before school, or even after school where they will have more time to discuss their ideas. Even they could meet on the weekends or get together on the weekends and discuss there ideas that they might have. A student should not be punished in this way for there grades.

Most students, don't have the same way of learning things. Some students may be hearing learners where they hear one thing and can remember it just like that, where other's may need to see what there working on and maybe still don't understand it that well. Not all of the students brains function the same way. Some might be fast learners, where others are slow learners and you can't hold that against the kid.

I do know that if a student has any grade lower then a C- that student should not be allowed to be on a sports team, or involved with the team until they bring there grade up to a C. Grades are very important don't get me wrong, but student's need to have a free life outside of school also. They come to school five days a week for more then thirty-five hours. These students get bored out of there mind. I would rather see these students have a C average and be out on the sports field playing sports then to see these kids out along the streets getting involved with drugs and other substances that could harm there body.

Those are the reasons that I find most important why students who get C average grades should be allowed to participate in sports, and other school activities. Students should not be punished in that way for the grades that they get.

25C400582197,"Dear Mrs. Principal with no given name,

Your addition to the school rules of requiring a B average to participate in all non mandatory sports related activities has come to my attention and I applaud you for it.

The fact that so many students have a C average is very disappointing. Students should strive to achieve much higher than a C, and upping the anti is just what this school needs. It is in my personal belief that one should only participate in extra curricular activities if they are already succeeding in the regular mandatory school activities.

As the saying goes, you should not learn to run before you have learned to walk.

There is another reason that this is a good and wise plan. Since many students in sport related activities are doing so poorly in school, taking sports away from them might-no, WILL encourage them to do better in school. Imagine if instead of working all an employee did was slack off and sleep on the job, demoting or firing them would force them to work harder and not reward them for doing nothing. Just like getting paid, sports related activities should be considered a reward for doing what you are supposed to, and as a reward it will be that much more sweeter for all those who partake in these activities.

Though I do have one suggestion that would improve the rule and possibly your popularity and image in the school. Have the rule not take affect until the end of next term, that way students who are doing poorly now have a chance to redeem themselves and not suddenly be kicked off their sports teams. They deserve a chance to straighten up and fly right.

There is another question that should be answered, will the rule still be in effect for students with special needs? Personally I do not believe that it should be the same, there should be some slight changes.

To sum it up, I believe that you are doing a good thing for our school but you could do things to ensure that the rule is a little more fair. Remember, this rule is for their own good.

I understand what your wanting to do, Having all the students to get B' s to participate in your schools sport program, but what you don't understand is that not everybody is capable of getting B' s in your school. Your students could try the hardest they ever tried but still not achieve what your goal is. Sometimes when students get a B or a C there parents and guardians congratulate them and they say to themselves that they did good. And some students rely on sports to help them with any issues that there facing in their personal lives. There are many other reasons why there should not be a change made, So many i cant even list them all.

They may feel bad because they couldn't achieve the grades that you recommended they should and that could result in students becoming depressed.

617F2F7BF090,"I am personally against the policy that states that a student has to maintain a B or better average to play a sport or participate in activities. To sustain a C average without playing sports is one thing. But if someone sustains a C average while playing one or more sports is actually quite an undertaking. See I play sports and I have an A average but believe me its not even relatively close to being easy. I believe that other rules having to do with the sports themselves should be altered before there is a change in the grade requirements.

The reason kids have such a challenge with grades while playing a sport is because to commit to a sport while balancing it with school is a tremendous undertaking. This is because while playing a sport you may have a two to three hour practice three to four times a week not including a game or two, that you have to play in each week. Another effect of sports on grades is that they leave you tired and exhausted, which makes it much harder to keep focused in a classroom environment.

If you are going to change something about the sports program change how long the practice can be or the amount of practices allowed per week. That in itself will give the student athletes more breathing room so they will have an easier time bringer their grades up. If these work than you can keep the required average at a C, but if these fail, that is when you would be obliged to make the required average a B so the students have more drive to keep their grades up. But at the time I think you should change the limitations of the sports programs in itself before any of the grade requirements are changed.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
3410CE477160,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I agree with your policy to make students participating in sports have at least a grade average of B . I think this would be an excellent way to encourage students to do better in their schoolwork, teach students responsibility, and to encourage students to participate.

If you were to make it a policy that students must have a grade of B average to participate in sports, it would make students want to do better in their school work. You and I both know that students would get a better scholarship if they get a grade average above a C. However, there isn't much initiative for students to try to get a better grade until it is much closer to senior year when it is usually too late to get a good scholarship. Since a lot of students at our school have a C and are willing to participate in sports or other activities, and they must have a B, those students would work harder to get a better grade.

Another reason why you should introduce this policy is because students would want to participate in the extracurricular activities. They would participate because they would know that only people that actually have an initiative to do work would be with them. I do not like to be around people that want me to do all the work for them. If I knew that the students that are in the same activities as me are as willing to do as much work as me, if not more, I would join more activities.

My age group lacks responsibility. Some of them just want to coast along with a C until we get to college and have to pay a lot of money to get in. If the lowest grade the students that want to participate in sports or other activities could get was a B , they would learn responsibility. I know that getting an A is not an easy job if you aren't willing to put in the extra effort, and a B also requires work. The students that participate in extracurricular activities would have to learn to be responsible enough to get in their missing work in or actually study for a test or else they would not be able to participate.

TEACHER_NAME, I hope you would look at my arguments carefully and seriously consider making this policy happen. If you were to introduce it and, give it time, the students would do better in their school work, want to participate in activities, and learn responsibility.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

A lot of people who play sports in schools don't have B averages. I think they should have a B average to play in games but at least a C average to go to practices. You should have a B average to play a game because you have a higher grade and since you have a higher grade than a C average you deserve to play because you've kept your grades up. If you have a C average you should only be able to practice because you haven't really gotten the best grade. If you have a C average, yeah you're still passing but you should have i higher grade to play the sport because the people who have the higher grade has probably worked on their work in school and they got good grades but sometimes people with a C average don't always try their hardest and they just rush through things without looking them over and deciding what is wrong and what is right.

Or maybe they could all play in the game but the one's with the higher grades can play more than the ones without the high grades. You might also say that they need a higher grade to do sports because you don't want the people falling behind and then having to kick that person off the sports team because they have a bad grade. You also might say that because you want to teach them that if they don't get good grades, they don't get to participate in good things like sports. The child could be trying their by golly hardest in school but they don't get good grades because of their tests and because they don't turn in their homework. But if the people or kids with the good grades only get good grades because they turn in their homework and they do good on their tests. At least they tried and you should give them credit for trying their hardest or just trying because in life you have to fail numerous times in order to succeed. Usually you can tell when someone is trying their hardest because you can see it in how they act and if they try to study and turn their homework in and at least try to get good grades and make an effort.

You can also tell when someone isn't trying because their not turning their stuff in on time and they aren't getting good grades and when you try to talk to them about school they just move to another subject and act like they don't know what you're your talking about because they just try to make excuses out of everything and then you try to bring up a subject and they ignore you and then a person would ask someone about the littlest things that had to do with school and that person would completely blank you out because they could really care less about what you think and about school and about what you think of them and school and they aren't doing so well and what you think they can do to fix how they think and work at school.

If a student has a b it is still passing the grade he\she is in. sometimes i think that grade doesn't matter its about what kind of student they are. Now sometimes the student is doing really bad so he\she shouldn't play in sports.

Even though there is a lot of students with a C grade average, I think this will make students work harder to bring up their grade so they can play in sports or activities again. I think the parents with children that have a C average think that they wasted their money on sports when the coaches are going to cut them off anyways. But i feel as though if they are going to do this, they should tell the parents and the students that they are going to cut them off because of their grade below a B so they could give the student a chance to bring the grade up. If they don't give the parents or students a warning about this there will be a lot of parents complaining. And nobody wants complaining parents because they could tell their friends with children that do play in sports that the coaches are just going to cut them off anyways, so why not just quit now so you don't feel embarrassing getting cut off.

I don't think that changing the school policy about having a B average to participate in sports is fair. Some students who participate in sports sometimes have a challenging class and requires lots of time on their homework. We know that taking on a sport means that you will need to balance your homework and the sport you're taking on but having a C average is pretty good if you're participating in a sport because your juggling your sport, homework, family and friends. Especially, us teens, we always want to go hang out or do something fun. If the policy changes to where you need to average a B, then it's going to be hard to the students because if they are super focused on school, they wont be focused during the game. If the student is focused on the sport, they wont focus on schoolwork so having a C average or higher is good for them.

I can relate to how some students would feel if you would change the policy because when I was in 6th grade, I had to find time for basketball, another basketball league outside of school, friends and schoolwork. I know it's my responsibility to do all of it but it was pretty stressful and I was only in 6th grade. If you wish to keep the policy, our students who are participating in a sport would benefit them because it would allow them to focus on the sport they love and schoolwork.

If you do not wish to keep the policy and change it, students wouldn't really benefit from it but would just make them more focused. I am not saying that being focused is bad but soon, students will get tired of the routine of: Going to school, practice, homework , shower, and sleep. Then they will stop doing sports and wouldn't be active , and become lazy. They also wont have time for their family because they are too focused on their grades. But maybe for some students it will help them push harder on their schoolwork.

Not everyone has a B average why not making a C average because then kids in our school will be more active. So kids might not be getting B averages and then that means that not a lot of athletes would be involved in sports. If children don't have those kinds of grades there wont be much kids in activities so the school will be wasting money for activities that children aren't in. So if you waste money on the pointless activities the school wont be able to afford field trips or other activities. Yeah I know the teachers might want us to do better in school but it has to be fair we should at least be passing and a C average is still a passing grade.

Imagine a world where school was struggle for you, no matter how much you work or try you never seem to get that A or B you're seeking. When school is done you're finally relieved because you get to play basketball with all your friends. Now hearing that you have to have a B average is going to crush you. Even though you've been working so hard. Therefore Students should be allowed to play sports or other activities even with a C average.

Good and hard working kids sometimes end up with a C average. They always try there best and do their homework. When those tests come around they just don't seem to get it, like all their hard work has gone to waste. These kids shouldn't have to quit their favorite activity if their grades are just average. Just because they got C shouldn't make them less capable to do the sports they find so enjoyable. Some of these C students might even work as hard as the students who are getting straight A' s.

Learning comes different to every person, for one it may be very easy and the topic isn't a struggle at all. For another the topic may not make any sense at all and they have to work so hard to try and understand but they never fully do. That student makes a C but the other gets an A even though they C student may have worked twice as hard.

Therefore students should be allowed to play sport or other activities even with a C average. Coaches and supervisors don't want to loose a fantastic players just because of a grade. The grade almost says nothing about that child and they shouldn't be judged by it. Keeping that kid in the sport or activity may keep their grades where they are and have a more positive attitude.

Students at our school should be able to play the sports they play, even if the student has a low grade. The student could continue playing sports through college, and maybe have a successful career in sports. Students should at least be able to play a sport with any grade, because it does not matter about how their grades are, they should be good in the sports they play in. For example: Lets say my friend has a low grade, just one. You shouldn't kick him off of whatever sport he plays, because, what would he think of the school then? And the student would be really upset, as he was just kicked off his sports team, because of one bad grade. This new policy would be very unfair to girls and boys who play sports, because what would the child say to their parent? The parent of the child would be really upset, because their child was kicked off of the sport they were playing. If many of the students have a C grade average, the student with the grade should still be able to play on their sports team. If I was kicked off my sports team, just for having on C on my report card, I would tell my parents and they would not be happy. My parents would want me to do good in school, too, but sports give students something to do, rather than sit at their houses, waiting for dad or mom to come home from work. Sports are a good education for any kid, and taking away what they do best, whether it be tossing a football, or playing lacrosse. What I am saying is, if you take a kid away from sports, he is basically being pulled from more education, as sports can have strategies just like math can. Sports are good to do after school, as the students can relax sometimes and just enjoy being kids. Sports can make a kid more muscular, and sports can also use some tactics that are sometimes used in math. When the kids go home, then they can do their homework, and relax after the homework is done. Kids are learning some great things from sports and the students could get a career in sports, because they played sports so much in school. Principals should not ban kids from their sports just because they did not get one single good grade. This would not be a fair policy to me, as if the whole school had at least one C average, and the whole school played sports, wouldn't that be a little harsh kicking every student off of their sports teams? Sports can help reduce stress at times, like football. If a kid is having a bad day, and he has a football game tonight, he could tackle somebody and feel better. Just keep in mind that, if the whole school had at least one C average on their report cards, it would not be fair to just ban kids from their sports, because a lot of people play sports, and you just can't kick everyone off of their teams, because this would be very unfair.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

They will believe that since they can raise their grades, they can do anything if they really want to. Being a better student will help them become a better person.

To maintain a grade B average in school students will try their very best.

Many students love to play sports and if they have to raise their grades to play, they definitely will try their best to do it.

Even I had to try my best so my grades would raise to a higher average so I could play sports.

If you require at least a grade B average you will see a big improvement in many students.

Students love to play sports and will try their best in school to do so.

If students have to maintain a grade B average in school many students grades will raise.

Students love to play sports and will do anything to play them.

Making this change will help students tremendously.

Even the grade average for the whole school will rise.

Well, since the school principal is deciding whether or not to raise the grade average for sports is actually good. Although many students have a grade C average, I would say that if they were to put as much effort as they do in their sports, YES, it would be a good decision.

That is if the students that are on the sports team want to be on the team that bad.

Despite all the anger that may rage through all of the student body, i have met people who do sports and maintain a straight A average.

So in saying, it is never all that hard to maintain a higher grade average, as long as you have the time, to do both, the time management, and mainly, the skills to do any of it.

As long as you have all of those things, then you don't have to worry about much.

I'm stating that, if students currently have a grade C average, then they should be able to put that extra work into it for their own benefit, not the benefit of the school.

Realizing all that could be done with such a step-forward, if this were to go to let's say, all public schools, then there would be students that would walk that extra mile.

If students would decide they really want something, just think on how much the national report card would rise.

Everything involving school would be effected -- in a good way.

Despite all of the controversy that may rise throughout the student body, it's for their own benefit, and for the nation's benefit as well.

So my answer is, YES, this would be a good idea. Though i would suggest the schools rise the average slowly, such as C-->C+-->B.

In that type of way, so the students would be able to accept what is happening more clearly.

This would be a huge benefit in almost everything, ranging from the stock market to the nation.

This would also call for more responsibility, and overall, more genius flowing through the veins of this nation.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I honestly think that isn't fair because the students who contain a C average might not have a good chance to get a higher grade for instance, if a child has an abusive step parent and get bullied at school do you honestly think that child can focus on their school work. No, he can't, he's to afraid he might get his butt kicked if the teachers leaves to use the restroom. That's one example look at this one, what if the child is mentally disturbed and suffers from ADHD That child might also be very good at sports because of his hyper-ness. That child might have a chance to become a millionaire, but if you pass this new policy you could hurt that child's chances. This is another good example, I'm sure as a principle you should know that some students are better at sports than others, and some are better at ""books"" then others. A child might be phenomenal at sports but maintain a D average. Like i stated earlier he could have abuse issues, focusing issues, hormone issues, or even sexual issues that stop him from thinking straight.

They need to learn that to get out of high you need to get good grades and stay in school because if u don't stay in school you want get a job.

That would not be fair to us students. Maybe kids are struggling because they don't get the material. they might need a tutor to help with that subject, because maybe sports are there lives like it is for me, it probably keeps them out of trouble, and if they cant get an B average they wont be able to play sports so they'll get trouble. keeping it at a c average will help them stay in sports.

For me sports help me a lot it pushes me to get good greads to stay in sports and it keeps me out of trouble because I am so caught up in school and in sports that i will have no time to get my self in to trouble, but maybe for other students it isn't like that they probably don't get the material and just need a little more help like a touter, an easier class or just need the material to be explained a little more maybe they just need a little extra help.

i think if u keep the C average it would be easier for the kids who love sports but need help in school to stay in sports and its not cool to not be able to stay in sports because they don't get the material, that's how it was for me in 7th gread i got below a c average and couldn't play sports. That was not fun, not one bit. the students at our school just need a little more help to keep their grade average at a c average and if you don't see any improvement in the students greads at our school then maybe you might have to enforce that rule.

maybe that will push the subnets to work harder to get their greads up to stay in sports if they really want to be in sports, and that's how i see this we just need a little more help that's it.

I don't think its right that your changing the school policy. Are school has had the same policy for the longest time and now you want to go and change it. I don't care if I get in trouble, and I don't mean that disrespectfully, but your wanting to here my opinion on this situation and i'm going to tell you.

Why must students have at least a grade B average to participate in school activities and sports?

Are school was just fine the way it was. Most of the students here are very smart athletically and academically. But now your telling the students if they want to join any sports or activities they have to have a grade B average. That's going to be really tough on many of them. What if there's going to be a big test on Friday and a big basketball game? What are the students supposed to do? They can't stay at home and study they'll get kicked off the team if they don't go. But they can't just go to the game because then they'll bomb the test and get a grade C average. And if that happens then they'll still get kicked off the team. Then you never know there's a good chance that either they'll stop trying at school work and fail or try harder. Do you want to take the chance though? I know i wouldn't.

So, I think in my opinion and most of the other students you should keep the same old policy. Keep it at you have to have a grade C average to participate in any school sports or activities. We all liked it that way. If you decide to take my advice and keep it the same then i'd bet that we would have the best school athletically and academically. All i'm asking is for you to at least think about what your reading and what i'm telling you.

Some student may even rebel against the school.

There are few students who have a grade B average or above. Also most of the schools athletes have a grade C average.

I Think what you're doing is an excellent idea. The reason why I say this is because if students like sports so much they can be able to get an B or A average. In these days if you tell a student that they wont be able to participate in sports or other activities they will try there hardest to succeed and get An A average. If a kid has an f or c for his 3rd quarter and you don't put him on the rite road that kid will keep failing unless someone teaches that kid responsibility and discipline. what im saying is you have to be hard on a student at all times so that way that student will be on point and making sure hes doing the rite thing.

I know as well as anyone else that sports are important in a child's life. Some students are incredibly gifted at sports, but others may not be. However, sports are a privilege, not a right. Many schools have a policy that students must obtain at least a D average which is barely passing. I don't think that this should be so. Although I don't think that the policy at our school should be changed to obtaining a B average either.

Many students excel at sports while others at schooling. Although there are some students that exceed in both of these fields, obtaining a B average is rather hard for some students, especially with being in a sport. Sports require team practices which are very exhausting on the body and the mind. Sometimes, when students get home from these practices, they don't have the energy for much. I know you are thinking that school is more important that sports, and most parents would agree with you, but without sports and exercise the childhood obesity level would skyrocket as it has in the last few years within adults.

I think that changing the activity participation grade level to a B average is a little extreme. However, I don't think that it should stay at a D average. Student's should actually have to try in school to have the privilege of being in a sport, but at a D average they don't have to. The policy at our school should be changed but not to an extreme of a B average. I thank you for your time and cooperation.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

We students all participate in some kind of sport, whether it be soccer or baseball, football or hockey, wrestling or golf. We all excel at our sport and we enjoy every sweet minute of it down the last grain of sand in the hourglass. Now you're threatening to take that away from us? We understand that school comes first, but without sports we are all just sticks in the mud. We lose our social skills, some of our friends, and even our spirit. So why take it away?

First off, We are threatened to lose our social skills. Sports is how we all interact with other people and with the world. What happens when we go to apply for a job and we are just too nervous or too unsocially educated to get it. Social skills is making new friends, if we don't do that then we will hardly ever if not never venture outside our circle of trust.

Next, some of us only get to see each other during sports because we don't go to the same school. We all have a tight bond with each other when we play, we don't necessarily have the same bond at school. Me for example, I only get to see my friend RELATIVE_NAME on Wednesdays and Saturdays for baseball practice. RELATIVE_NAME doesn't go to my school so i don't get to see him as often as my friend RELATIVE_NAME.

As well as social skills and friendships, it will crush our spirits. School just isn't fun whenever you don't have a sports activity afterwards. In fact that's why school is bearable for most of us students. You sit at a desk all day in five boring classes using your brain for six hours a day. It is boring, but its all the more worth-while if you have a game or practice to go to after.

Now we figured you'd counter all those reasons like school is more important, without an education your nothing, blah, blah, blah. Of course your right school is more important and we should have certain requirements on campus. But we're not talking about on campus we're talking about after school and the local park which gives you absolutely no right for us to have requirements outside of school grounds. That's our parents jobs to tell us to get our grades up or no baseball, not yours.

In conclusion, if we don't have sports our lives will be more miserable than an athlete trying to get away with steroids. It will crush spirits, friendships, and our social skills.

Ever since you've placed a new policy about student's after school programs I've been thinking about its outcome on other students. This new policy may and may not work on the students because your new requirement enables students to have at least a grade B average. Which many students are not. Whether many students may be a grade C average, I still believe that students should have at least a grade B average in order to play sports for numerous reasons.

For one I believe that this new policy of yours may actually help students confidence build up. Imagine students, who have a letter C average wanting to play sports after school but aren't allowed to play because of their poor academic achievements. This way students would have to work harder for their after school freedom and privileges. Not only would this new policy of yours would encourage students to work harder, but would also help them achieve greater accomplishments for their grades.

Another one of my reasons for encouraging your idea of the policy is that it would also allow students not to allow their scores go down for the sliest chance. With their requirement to have a letter B average on their mind would consistently remind students to do their best during school. Although you may believe that this reason may be unnecessary, stop and think about students who have after school activities, let them selves let loose and whined up letting their grades go down. This way, as i have already mention, would non stop remind students to do their best during their school activities.

This is a serious cause to many people but for some reason many of those students have a grade C average but you must have a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. In this reasonable letter I will be supporting my argument with specific reasons. Feel welcome to not accept my reasonings but i assure you that it will be better to let C students be eligible for playing sports.

My number top one reason is that the school will lose popularity do to the fact that students will transfer out to another school in search of a school that accept C students in sports and other activities. The school will lose money but not that much but yeah they will have no more basketball games or any other sport that requires an entrance fee. So I really think that you should consider the policy before you make it official. Another reason to let these students get in sports is that a C is a passing criteria grade point average score. Another reason is that it will help the students out of gang and drug participation, instead they would be in school training or participating in a school activity.

So please TEACHER_NAME help the school by accepting C students into sports. It would save you a lot of F students and trouble with the school.

People who enjoy sports and play them a lot and want a career in sports need a lot of time to train for their potential success. This would limit the time to focus on academics, but since they want a sports career, they wouldn't need it as much as other jobs.

And since a grade C average is passing, it wouldn't be fair to need a grade B average to play sports.

Athletes with a grade average below B would feel like all their training was for nothing.

B330C76B790E,"Dear principal,

I heard of your plans to make the policy for grade average for attending activities from C to B and i do not agree with this. If you change it to a B then many people will not be included in activities. Their is many people who are smart and try that have C' s but they shouldn't be punished for it. many kids try their hardest to succeed but cannot. They do all their homework, try on their tests, and pay attention in class but cannot apprehend the work when it comes time to do it.

Others don't try at all, they don't even look at their homework, they sit and play around during class, and don't listen at all. The teachers should be the ones who decide who should stay out of activities. If they turn everything in, appear to pay attention and not play around then they should get to do the activities. Those who do the opposite should stay out of activities.

When you change something that drastic things could happen. The kid could be made fun of by others by not being allowed to go, and be called ""stupid."" Also kids that are not allowed could sneak in and cause trouble at an activity like fighting or eating to much of provided snacks and others not get anything to eat. Another thing is the kids that are left out are left out and alone and they don't get to see their friends and socialize properly.

Also when you cancel out the kids from activities, such as football, you can lose valuable players and lose and get a bad rep for the team/school. Most of the football players can get C' s easily and still learn the same amount and do the activity. Say the quarterback has a great academic year and passes with A' s all year long. He is obviously smart and capable of work. The next year that same kid is passing with a 79% right below a passing B. He is still the smart kid from last year, but maybe he wanted to step his game up academically and take all honors and he is getting piled up with work. He is still learning fine, but he is receiving to much work so it is lowering his grade. If you change it to a B then he can still play and be satisfied that he gets to because if you take the football away he could get emotionally upset and completely forget his work.

So, i think you should keep the passing grade for attending activities the same, at a C average, but have the teachers give a list of who is trying their hardest and doing their best to pass, and give a list of who is slacking off, and not doing anything.

If the teachers of the student think that they are working hard to bring their grades up at least the principal should give the students 30 minutes of free time on the activities or sports they want to participate in.

The school should make a contract saying that students that have a C average cant participate in sports or activities.

In order to keep a B average, students would have to put all their time and effort into their schoolwork, which is hard to do if you spend three hours a day doing a school sport. Here's what RELATIVE_NAME school day looks like. RELATIVE_NAME gets out of school at 3:00, and goes right to football practice. RELATIVE_NAME practices until 6:00, and rides a bus home, which takes 30 minutes. RELATIVE_NAME gets home at 6:30, and does his chores until dinner at 7:00. When he finishes dinner he quickly finishes the nightly homework, because if he put any time into finishing it, he would be in bed by midnight, and would only get 6 hours of sleep. Some of RELATIVE_NAME's friends are in band and football, and have to practice their instruments for 30 minutes each day, along with chores, and 5 periods worth of homework.

Also, C average is a passing grade, for some people, passing is hard enough, so to make them go above the level of expectation, is a lot to ask. For people like me, it is not hard to get an A or B, but for people with a lot less time on their hands it can be very difficult. I used to play school volleyball, and I was having a lot of problems keeping my grades up, so I decided to quit, in order to keep my grades up.

For many people, keeping a B average would not let people get nearly enough sleep to stay awake during their classes, and it is unreasonable to make them have a grade above passing if they participate in a school sport.

We students love our sports! Just because we may drop below a B every so often doesn't mean we should not get to play our sports. For some of us it may not be the sports that are making our grades drop. It could be that some of us just need a little tutoring or a little help in the subject. Also, many students parents put in a lot of money so their children can play that sport.

So you could have a lot of angry parents wondering why there child could not play their sport when they have a 79 average in math for their report card. There is also another problem if the child gets kicked out of the sport because other children on that team rely on them to play their part. Other children may not automatically step up to fill the position. Also, when you do this you are depriving children of their excersise which is very important to growing teens like myself .So you see? There are very good reasons why this shouldn't happen.

A c is suppose to mean average so if they at least have a C average they should be allowed. You should have to worry more about the people getting F' s and D' s.

I am a student at your school pondering about should student should play sports if they have a B average well, i' m against that reason. Saying sports make some students better at school. One reason is that students that play sports manage their time better than people who do not play sports because, students who do play sports or have other after school activities have more on their plates than others, they have to practice, they have to have homework, and they maybe have to help their mothers with their baby brothers.

My second reason is that people who play sports have better grades for example people who do play sports the coaches support them at everything they even help them with their home work take it from me I have seen it myself the coaches even come to the class room to check up on their players not just their star players but every player!

Another reason is that people who never played sports our nervous they do not no what to expect but their team mates have their back every step of the way and encourage them to move on and don't quit or give up they help them move on.

Also talent scouts can help them get it into new colleges so they will not be on the streets, being in jail, or somewhere else who know' s what will happen to them. I have experienced good sportsmanship myself so

We the students think that the B average rule is wrong.

Other's also agree that this rule is unfair to those who have a low average. We think that if you would consider changing it to a C average.

Most kids like to join in school sports also with the kids who don't have B averages and were in school sports would mean they would be kicked out and possibly leave the school meaning less students also meaning the school would be forced to shut down due to low population of students. We would like for you to consider thinking about a better opportunity for not only the kids but the school too. Also if your thinking this might not happen ask the students. They will tell you a better way to improve the school in reasonable ways. Ideas from kids just like me and students can help me today and tomorrow a brighter day.

I am arguing against raising the average to participate in sports or other activities to a B. It is a good idea for having students earn participation in sports or activities.

Most students just can't make a B average.

There are many great athletes that can't make B averages that we need to participate in sports.

In my opinion, the average should be lowered to a C average, that way they can earn participation in sports, but it is possible for everyone.

Lowering the average to a C is a good idea because a lot of great athletes can't make a B average.

To have our school excel in sports, we must have these great athletes.

Most of the best athletes at this school can really only make C averages.

It is a lot easier to make C averages, so we can have great athletes participate.

Most colleges that are the best in sports require students to make C averages.

Are school will be great in sports with great athletes that have more time to focus on sports instead of grade averages.

Not lowering the average to a C will eliminate the best athletes.

I think it is important for students to earn participation academically, but a B average is just too much.

I hope you will change your mind about having expectations that are too high for students.

I think if students make a D or F average, they shouldn't be able to participate, but if they make a C average it should be enough to participate.

In conclusion, raising the average to a B to participate is a bad idea.

Most student athletes have a hard time making B averages, so it will be easier to make C averages.

If it is a B average, this school won't excel in athletics.

I disagree with your consideration of only letting students with a B average play sports. I don't think that its fair for you to only let students that only have a B average to play sports.

The reason i think that is because many students that don't have a B average love to play sports like me, but that's beside the point. I also think that you just letting students that only have B average play a sport will probably not succeed because I know a lot of students that only have B average hates sports. Students with only a C average will probably hate the fact that they can't play their favorite sport because their grade. I would probably think that boys with C average would really hate the fact that cant play football, basketball, baseball and stuff like that because of what their grade is.

Some things I do agree with you in is the fact that they need to bring their grade up. I'm not saying that you should let students with an grade point average of a D or an F because that would just be wrong. I also think that its right to let them be able to bring their grade up and make it better.

I agree with your plan for this policy. First, I believe this will be a motivation for the C average students. Second, the students that do work hard can participate as a reward for working hard.

The first reason I agree is because the students that are getting lower grades that still want to do sports can look at this new policy as a motivation. Students may be getting a C or D or maybe even be failing more than a few classes. But these students still want to do sports. Because the are getting low grades, they cannot participate unless they work harder to get higher grades.

The second reason I highly suggest to enforce this policy is to reward the students that are already working hard. The students receiving high grades deserve privileges. Being able to play sports and other activities after school can be a privilege. This will also prove and show the other students what rewards they may receive by working hard.

Therefore, I believe you should change the school policy and raise the expectant grade level to a B average for students that would like to participate in sports and other activities.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

The students must realize that there work will take them further than there athletic ability. If someone truly wants to succeed in life they can't just rely on their ability to play a sport.

A student athlete has the word student in it first and there's a reason for it. If a student wants to participate in a sport they must excel in academics first. The athlete should earn the right to be playing before they actually do. They can't just ease through school and think that they'll be ok.

Most athletes don't make it on their ability to play a game and will excel in something else. The student should realize it is only just a game and they should focus on other things than just that game. When a person goes to college it is based on their grades on an act or an sat as well as their grade point average.

There are many reasons why a student athlete needs to excel at his academics. They need to be ready for life after the game. A student should actually try in school instead of just coasting through school with grades that will let him pass for athletics.

I disagree (With many other students) about this ""possible"" policy change. We (as students) think that it would be acceptable if we were able to do sports and other activities even if we didn't have higher than a B average because it depends on the students talent and interests.

I think it depends on the students talent because (for example) if the person that wanted to do basketball and was one of the top players, and they had a C-/D+ average and is not that good in their classes because they aren't interested in that, then there would be a problem. Which connects talent and interests in a student. The student could be interested in everything to do with school, but not be interested in sports, they would be able to do sports and extra curricular activities, but it would just go to waste if they were not interested in any of that type of stuff.

If the policy doesn't change and that student who has a C/D average was able to play basketball, then the school would also have to support because if that person was able to play; it would probably help our school out a lot at basketball games because they would be a good player.

So, as you can see, changing the regular policy would be not be a better choice for this school, and also the interests and talents these student have. Thank you.

The shy children who don't understand the text, might be more willing to raise their hand and ask for help, so they can do those kind of things.

Its what keeps them more willing to go to school every morning. So i suggest that the principal do change the school policy.

6FA5D944A279,"Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

Please do not consider changing the school policy! The average grade in the United States is a C. Most people, try as they might, cannot get a grade above a C!

Most of these students depend on sports! If they know that they are not talented academically, they will try their luck elsewhere, i. e, sports. So many students get sports scholarships nowadays! If the principal will not allow these athletes to play sports, they probably will not be able to practice elsewhere, and then they will fail both academically and physically. Is that what miss principal wants? Does she want to take away young students' opportunities of getting into a good college? If that is so, then so many talented students would end up going to somewhere like Rochester College instead of Yale University.

More than half the student population in the United States are obese! And 10% of those people are morbidly obese. If miss principal wants her students to suffer from obesity AND poor grades, then principal should not take away the students' right to play sports with a grade lower than a B! If miss principal wants more students to die from atherosclerosis, stroke, blood clot, hemorrhage, hypertension, myocardial infarction (fancy way of saying heart attack), liver disease, or anything else that is often associated with obesity, the student population will rapidly decrease, and miss almighty principal will not get a decent amount of money from her job. Is that what you want?

Without proper exercise and sports, many people will be prone to falling ill. It won't be fair if only the smartest of the smart nerds get proper exercise and defense against viral infections! More and more people will get sick, and the more people that get sick, the more it will spread, and the more absences there will be. Trust me; I would know. Before I started playing soccer and basketball last year in seventh grade, I was a sickly child. Every time a virus went around the school, I would catch it and get sick (and I was pretty fat). However, now, I have a defense mechanism from getting proper exercise from exceptional coaches, and I haven't gotten sick in a year and a half. This proves that everyone needs proper exercise to stay fit and healthy, and the best way to get the exercise is through a school sport, such as basketball, cheer, soccer, football, etc.

So miss wonderful amazingly awesome principal, please consider my thoughts while you decide whether you change the school policy or not.

Many would seem to object to the thought of having to maintain a B average to participate in sports, but I for one, agree. Students may take it as unfair, but they do not realize that without education, they have nothing. To get into better universities, they will not accept grades that are not exceptional, let alone standard. I believe these students are trying to ""just get by"" in their class work, leading them to become irresponsible, lazy, and completely oblivious to the fact that the better jobs out there require more than a ""standard"" degree. Most school athletes believe that right out of high school, they will be drafted into a professional sports career, and for some, it is true. However, the statistics of ever making it into a professional league is slim, and for those who don't make it, and sadly don't care about their education, and end up getting a job that pays little to none and wishing that they did what they were supposed to do in school.

A lot of the time, my fellow students think that average is good enough, and it's sad to say that I know that some of them won't do well out of school. I know students who are going to drop out of school or not go to college, and it breaks my heart to see them make those mistakes.

I do understand that there are students who just don't understand the work, but a lot of the time, they don't get help with it, making harder on them self. Honestly, if you expect to do sports and get a good education, a C is not good enough.

I also think it is a great idea to not allow students to partake in school activities, such as dances and field trips, if their grades are not up to par. If students want to have fun they should want to get their grades up. We teens and pre-teens anticipate so much from the everyone and everything, but we don't understand when our parents or teachers want us to succeed.

To make a long story short, why should students be able to do what they want, if they are not doing what they need to do. Grades are just as influential as having fun so that's why I agree with you that they should maintain a B average to participate in sports and activities.",5,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

Dear Principal,

I would like to ask of you to please lower your requirements from having a grade B average to a C average. This way more students will be able to participate in after school activities or any sports. Many students have a C average, and if one must have a B average then there won't be many students involved more at school anymore because of their grades. Since students wouldn't be able to participate after school they might be out doing bad things they should not be doing. For example, if there is a grade C average student, and he or she isn't able to participate in an after school activity he or she might be out doing something far more worst. Is that something you would want your students to be doing? If you were to lower the requirements to a grade C average, then we would have more students involved with their school. Also, a C is a passing grade so you wouldn't have to worry about them failing. In addition, maybe having them in after school activities or any sports could help them bring up their grade by motivating them to get a higher grade and to not slack in any of their studies because they must maintain a C average or above. I know you may think having the requirements of have a C will maybe let them think they must not try harder in their work or studies, but please have in mind that your students will know that you gave them a chance to try and be involved more in school, have fun, and get to be a part of their school's sports team or volunteering club or whatever it is they'd like to be in. All we must do is just tell them to try and bring up their grades, motivate them so they can become great people in the future.

After school or during school activities like basketball, soccer, volleyball, track, wrestling and others, are basically what kids want. Taking that privilege away can hurt them not only emotionally, but physically as well. Kids are very active, hyper and full of energy. Running it off will cool them down, and make them feel good about themselves as a person.

A B average is a lot to ask for in a student. Especially the one who can hardly get a C average, which is passing. If C is a passing grade, why higher the expectation? You can even graduate from high school with straight D's. If you can graduate with D's, what's so wrong with a C? They're not the greatest grade you can get, but it's most definetly passing.

Some kids might even only want to go to school for sports. Because you can do something you love, and maybe even get a scholarship for it. If you practice hard enough and get good at it, you can achieve it. Taking this away from students won't help at all, it can actually possible make things worse for not just one student, but multiple. Some parents might even count on their kids to get a scholarship for a sport, because they struggle academically. Or maybe, just because their parents played sports.

Canceling sports for people who may ""academically struggle"" [not getting a B average], is pointless. If you as a child loved something, let's say a sport. If school was the only place you could play that sport, then it was all of a sudden canceled. How would you feel? Wouldn't you feel kind of bummed? I think so. That's how everyone who plays sports feel. Maybe it's for the better, maybe not. Maybe it will encourage the students to give extra effort to their grades, maybe it won't.

With whatever you do, think of how many students do get a B average. Good for them, they'll get to be able to stay in that activity, no worries for them. But then, think of all the students who don't. Good luck with your choice, hope it works out for the best.

I understand your viewpoint on this topic but I am not with you on this one. I have reasons why. One reason is because a C really is not that bad. Its still passing but its not like a D or an F. Another reason is because some subjects can be difficult for students and if they do not understand the subject its not fair to say that they cannot play a sport or any other activities.

Kids tend to love to play sports or do a school activity. Its just a known fact. Its good for them and gives them a break from work and school. I could understand if you said that if a student has a D or an F, but a C? I know they aren't the best grades, but i think that if the student puts effort into their work that they should be able to play sports. A c is still passing. I can see that if the student just does nothing and doesn't try, but makes it by with a c then he doesn't deserve to play a sport. As long as the student tries he or she should be able to play a sport or do an activity.

Subjects in school can be a lot of trouble with grades. Some students can just understand certain things better than another one can. I know that math is not my strongest subject and sometimes i don't understand it. Kids around the world have trouble with a certain subject. If they do it can affect your grade. If the student does not understand their science test, but he studied for almost an hour the night before and still doesn't do well then i don't think you should really say that he cant play a sport. If someone is a bad in a certain subject but they try their hardest then they should be able to participate in sports and school activities. The student may be very talented in the sport but not in the subject. I think you should understand this.

I know you think that kids need to do better to participate in activities. They should do better but i think all of the kids around the world will say something close to what I said. The biggest part is that a c is not that bad. Its just one away from a b. The student could have a high c and be so close to a b that he can taste it. Just think about the subject the student has a c in. Try to see if he tries or if he doesn't. I don't think a grade c average is not that bad as long as the student tries his or hers hardest to pass.

Did you know that 90% of kids going into college get into the schools they want to because of academics as apposed to athletics.

I agree with creating a policy in which students must have at least a B average in order to be allowed to play sports.

Three reasons why I think this is a good policy is because it would force kids to try harder in school, get better grades, and allow them to have a better future.

To begin, some students are naturally gifted in school and have no problem doing well in school and playing sports.

Other kids either struggle or slack in school and aren't able to be successful in both school and sports.

This policy would benefit kids who are receiving an average of a C or lower on their report card.

It would force them to get better grades if they wanted to play sports.

Over 1/2 of high school and middle school athletes wouldn't be meeting the expectations of this policy.

If this idea was enforced than many athletes would be able to have more choices in which college they go to.

Also, many kids are smart but don't try in school because they are so preoccupied by athletics.

This is reason that many kids playing sports have worse grades than kids who aren't playing sports.

Lastly, this would force kids to study and do homework before they go to their game, match, or practice.

This would help kids to better on quizzes, tests, and unit exams helping to reach the B average that the policy asks for.

Moreover, kids would get better grades if this policy was enforced in schools.

Kids with averages lower than a C would need to get better grades in order to be able to continue to play the sports that they wish to play.

Having this rule would cause kids to care about academics as much or even more than athletics.

This would force them to either get better grades and continue to play sports or quit sports and continue with a C or lower average.

Lastly, if students are forced to get better grades if they wish to continue playing sports then kids wouldn't have the choice of whether or not they get good grades.

They wouldn't spend time worrying that if they get an A that people will think that they're too smart.

Instead they will be trying so that they can continue to play the sports that they like to.

Lastly, if this policy is created in our school system then kids will be forced to get good grades and develop good learning skills from a young age, thus helping them to prepare for high school and college.

They will have a good work ethic going into college and hopefully continue to always try their hardest in school and everything they do.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

In this letter I am going to how changing the average of students grades to B, it will keep kids more educated, it will help the school be a smarter school, and will give kids a punishment if they don't have an average of a B.

Students will be more educated by having more time to do homework then play ball. Lots of kids who play sports take more of their time practicing then doing school work. For example I play soccer at SCHOOL_NAME it takes a lot of time out of my day but I still enjoy it. I have straight A' s too. Student that don't make the team will have more time to study for a test or do homework. They may even make better grades then the people that are in sports which is great.

SCHOOL_NAME will be a smarter school by changing the grade policy to a B average. Instead of the kids making bad grades that are in sports they can be making good grades out of sports. we will have more smart kids in our school instead of good athletic teams. i know that these is a big change in our school but I think we can do it.

Students will also have a punishment for people that are it sports with a low average of their grades. Kids that make bad grades that are on the school teams. kids will be scoring higher so they can get on the school sports team.

In conclusion, by changing the grade average to B to be in sports kids will, be more educated, we will be a smarter school, and kids will have punishment if they don't have B average. Thank you for listening to my concerns.

Sincerely,

Over the years the life expectancy has been growing and growing but our generation is the first that is going to make it drop, according to scientist studies. All student should have to participate in physical activities. If students are failing physical activities then you should off one on one help during excel or electives.

I disagree because, one all most every kid loves their sports if its watching it or doing it.

And second of all not every kid is as smart as a B or better average grade some can only get a C- or better. I know im only as smart as a C- average. So i say they should only have to keep there grades up at a C- or better to play any sport. Well look at them all most every kid has a C average so why not let them have a C average and be able to play in sports or other activities. If they have a B average then that's great but if they have at least a C average then that's good to, so don't you think we should be able to play sports or other activities if we have C` s? If everyone had B `s then we all would be as smart as each other and most likely get the same points on a test like everyone else, then the teachers would question if we cheated or not even though we didn't we just new the correct anwsers.

I want to know why are you changing the policy for sports. Most children these day have about a C not a B because they are more focus on the sport then the grades. They work on school work after practice. They really don't have time too be studying with the rate there going they only want too play a sport. they might not be as good in school and only know how to play a sport and your messing it up for them.

just look into it and think about it. Or look at all the players grades and see what they have, its not lower then a C so don't change the policy in till you see grades go up in too the B range. But really what you should be doing is having study hall for the kids to study before practice every other day for about three week or in till you see some grades go up and if that doesn't work who every isn't doing there work just kick them out of sport in till grades goes up.

Hearing that you are changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports and other activity because we have a C average is upsetting. A high average of the children may have a C average but its not fair for those who actually have an A average. I'll agree that it is a smart idea to change the policy so that students will do better but its unfair for others. Sports ties into physical activity and children need that, what sense would it make to not let kids participate in that?

Physical activity is important to children, and they enjoy it too! Its a stated fact that people should get at least 60 minuets of exercise per day. Also, as for other activities like school trips... as a word of advice some field trips are educational, and sometimes teachers give us assignments based on those trips. As for the other students that are marvelous this would be really unfair to them. Personally, if I was an A average student and I wasn't allowed to participate in and sports and other activities I'd be really upset and disappointed

As a normal student who goes to school every single day and keeps on learning (not like learning isn't fun) I strongly believe that you should let us participate in sports and other activities because those are the only times in school when we're not reading and writing. It gives us a break, and you may not notice -but that is really what us children need. Not saying that this was a bad idea to think of, but if you change the school policy and don't let children participate in sports and physical activity it wouldn't really motivate them to improve their averages.

If you really think that changing the school policy and letting students not participate in sports or other activities... you should really take this letter into consideration.

17A4A5CB6DCE,"Dear Mr. Principal,

I have recently over heard that you are changing the school policy so that only students with a grade of B or above my participate in sports and other activities. In some ways I agree with this change. Education is more important than other activities. Yet, sports and other activities are also very influencing in a child's life.

This change is reasonable in many ways. Education is always more important than sports and other extra-curricular activities. School is what helps people have a effective life. It's the foundation of a successful life. Although sports are good for the body, education is what makes people's futures brighter.

Although education is very important, I also think sports and other activities are very prominent too. Sports are what make people healthy. They can make personal issues better. For example, if someone is very self-cautious of their weight, lots of running and workouts can improve those things. Sports can also improve a student's behavior. Not only do they provide exercise, they also teach students how to use team work to get things accomplished. They also teach students a very important life lesson: how to cooperate with on another.

In addition, other activities can get kids involved in their communities and the school. Joining recycling club can teach students how to make the Earth a better place to live. Maybe they'll take the initiative and go pick up trash in their own neighborhoods. Plus, statics say that students participating in sports and other activities are less likely to do drugs.

In conclusion, I think changing the policy is a very big mistake. Although most of the students in our school have a grade average of C, I think they should still be able to participate in sports and other activities. Being active in sports can make for a more healthy person. Also, activities can get students more involved in their communities and the school.

Best regards,

A very concerned student",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I say students do not need a B average to participate in sports. Many students i know have a C average, sometimes a B average. Every day, students need something to look forward to, help them and help them stay fit. To take away someone's pursuit of happiness is against the constitution. I declare that it is not right to take away sports from C average students!

Students need something to look forward to everyday. If I had nothing to look forward to everyday I would be depressed. Many of my friends who are in sports, look forward to after school sports. They look forward to games, practices and seeing their friends everyday. Even if they were to join a school sport and had no friends in that sport, they could make friends. I am not a very social person, so i don't really have anything to look forward to at school, other than friends. Athletes usually like or love the sport they play or else they wouldn't be playing it. Even if a person weren't getting a B average, they would only have a little bit to look forward to. Plus, having a C average motivates them to at least try hard. Never have I ever met someone who didn't like the sport they played.

Sports help people. A good alternative to drugs and alcohol is sports. If you were to take away school sports, I bet there would be a incline of drugs and alcohol at school. Making and keeping friends is a great life skill. Raise the average grade up to a B and ou will be taking that away. Sports can also become relaxing. I learned that doing exercise releases a chemical in your brain that makes you feel happy. So having a school sport, say if they were almost at a D average instead of a C, they would play, realize, then work harder at school. B averages are sometimes hard to reach, like if there is fighting at home. C is an overall average for a reason. To relax, athletes focus on sports. Relaxing inspires them to do better in everything. Another thing about sports is they prevent suicide and such. If a students parents were fighting, they might not know what to do. But, if a athletes parents were fighting, he or she could go outside and start playing a sport.

One thing over the years in America that has happened is that there is an obesity problem. So if we keep school sports open to those who have a C average, we will also be reducing the obesity level in our schools. Staying fit is very important. If someone really loved a school sport, and you raised the average up to a B, and they had a C, they would be crushed. Not only would they be crushed, they would be stressed. Stress leads to eating, sleeping, and school problems. Then all that junk leads to other things. Obesity is one of those things. I know I get stressed out really easy and sometimes i just want to run around, but at my house there is no place for me to run around. Many students have no place to run around when they don't feel right. Give them that chance!

Keep sports grade averages at a C!

B averages mean above average for one thing, and a C means average. Being average is ok, it may inspire people to be better. One day, everyone will learn how much they love a certain sport and there will be less stress, something to look forward to everyday, and help with the weight problem in America. Stay at a C average! Thanks for your time.

1EFF8C09C229,"Dear Principle,

Students grades seem to be a very important issue in today's society, so why do students feel sports are more important than grades? In my opinion, schoolwork and grades much more important than sports. It is necessary to create a policy where students must have a B average or above to participate in any activities. Students today have too much to do, and if this policy is created they would be getting better grades. For this reason, a policy is in the students best interest.

For one thing, students are under too much pressure with schoolwork and sports, which is why creating this policy would be best for them all. After having a long day of school, then going to do an after school activity, they have little time to do homework and study. Because of this, students rush causing their bad grades. Many people in this world feel they can do it all, when some people have a harder time multi tasking. By creating this policy, students would not feel pressured by sports which would create time for schoolwork and studying. Students would not feel rushed while doing their work if this policy were to be created.

Another reason this policy is a good idea is because it would bring the children's grades up. Students need to be able to have good grades. To get into good colleges, they do not only need good SAT scores but also good grades. Sports and activities are ruining their chance of getting into a good school. Many students have a C average, which is not substantial for them to get into the college of their choice. My cousin who one had soccer and tennis going on at the same time began seeing her grades drop. Once she saw that she had a lower score than she usually had, her grades rose back up. By creating this policy, students who do not see the problem, could realize they can not handle schoolwork and activities at once. Many students' grades will rise if this policy is enforced.

For these reasons, a policy is required for the students to get better grades. Without a doubt this is a very important issue that would resolve the problem. Many people today do not see the issue and need help to get better grades.",5,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
8F4D8B1065BB,"I think that the principal should not take away sports privileges because some students are dedicated to the sports that they play and if they can't play them because there grades are to low they might drop more because the sports might help the students focus on school projects and work. If half of the students can't play in the sports they might have t forfeit the matches because shortage of players. Some of the players use sports to take there anger out on the games instead of on people and if they cant do that they might start to take there anger out on some of the students. If half of the players cant play because of there grades they might lose out on a scholarship they are trying to earn by being monitored during the games. I don't think it is fair to take away these rights from students who have trouble in school. If they are going to put a rule I think it should be ""students must show effort or improvement on there grades in order to keep there individual privileges of sports and other activities"". The students should not lose the rights to sports and other actvities.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

School is a place for a lot of things. We learn, talk, play, and plan. And when i said plan i meant for the future. Like where we are going to go in life. If some kids aren't so good with their grades and keeping it at a B average or higher, why ex-out a career that they could possibly succeed in? I mean if school wasn't always their passion and if they were always that C average type of kid why would you completely just knock a positive future out of their hands.

Some kids are great in school. They stay on the honor roll all year and get awards at the end of the year. And some kids are ok in school. They keep their grades up to a C and at the end of the year they walk home happy knowing they are going on to the next grade. The kids with the awards has an planned future for himself. He's going to become a doctor whereas the kid with the C' s has a unplanned career. The only thing he is good at is sports, but he cant really show out with his talent because his principal would not allow him to play. Do you want his failure in the future to be because of you?

I know you are probably thinking that if you don't push him to bring up his grades he will never become smarter, but what if his destiny is not be a doctor or a lawyer? What if his destiny is to become a football player or basketball player? He has the decision to bring up his grades or to leave them on his own. Its his life, not yours but his life could easily be influence by your decisions.

So the next time you want to make a new rule, think about how it can effect the lives and futures of others, because you never know. A judge could be in one of those classrooms or maybe even a Kobe Bryant.

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I would like to tell you some reasons not to change the grade requirements for after school sports and activities. The students want to be able to participate in sports and activities because it lets them be free and cope with problems they might have at the time. They might have problems running or jumping so they join the soccer team to help with running. The students could also be trying very hard to get a C but barely make it. If you change the requirements for after school activities then they wont be able to participate because they can barely make a C. Many students would not be able to participate with the activities because of their grades so the people directing the activities might loose their job because of the lack of participating students. If you change the requirements for participating in after school activities then you wont only be hurting the students but the people that run the activities too.

Not everyone is a very well student but they always give there 100% best every time but cant seem to not always get good grades. You should at least let people with C averages still be able to play the sport they want because at least they passed. Passing is something that's a very good thing so you can go on to the next level. I know that if you get only a 70 as passing its ok but usually people if they work hard enough can get better grades and bring up there average.

We students don't think its fair not seeing our friends we have not being able to play on the team sport with us because they have a C average. It seems like were apart from some of our friends when we planned on playing a team sport together but we don't. This makes us sad and makes us not want to even join a sport because with out our friends we don't think we could stay as strong at times and have someone to help us along the way.

Please let C average people play a team sport because passing should make them aloud to play a sport with working hard and trying there best to work hard and passing. Not everyone can get higher then C average's. We as students disagree with you not allowing C average students to not play a sport.

I agree 100% with you. i think in order to be on a team sport you will have to have you grade up to a B. I think that because its not fair to the teachers if all you think about is sports and your grades are going down in school but you are doing sports. That telling the teachers you just don't care. Also i think its unfair to the other students that you are on the soccer team but have grades that are failing and you miss practice all the time because you have detention. Its fair do have the honor students play for are school even if there not the best in the school. Also its unfair to you. You will have bad grades but do well in sports. You should do a activity i agree with that but only if your grades are high. Why would you want bad grades? you should pass. Also it just doesn't seem right. Or you could get a scholarship into a college for sports but it wouldn't boost your grade up all the way to get in a great college.

My view on this rule is that you should allow students with a C average to participate in school activities because there are some people that are bad at school but good at sports. Some of the students that have a C average could be helpful in winning championships. There are some sport stars that are horrible at school but not on the field. We never know what we teenagers are going to end up as. Some of us could be really famous sport stars. If you would not let us play, then how would we find our real self.

For example, maybe some people from the Pittsburgh Steelers weren't good at school but they turned out very successful. It's not only about sports it could also be about band or art. Maybe students in art could become the next famous painter who painted a drawing that could become more famous then the Mona Lisa. Students in band could become very successful in the music business. You should give us opportunities to become who we really want to become.

In this school there is a program called the Christian Club. Well maybe if you don't let these students participate then they aren't going to be interested in their religion. These students need to have the confidence that there are other students in the same religion that are willing to learn more about their religion. Many of our students here are Christian while many others are Catholic or another religion. Some religions believe different things and so the kids need to know how to follow their religion.

So, according to me you should let us participate in any activity that we are interested in. I'm really interested in soccer and I would be really upset if they told me I couldn't play because of my bad grades. These school activities are basically our future.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I think the policy that you are considering is an out range to many athletes at your school or any schools as a matter a fact.

I think athletes like my self should at least have a 2.0 grade average because that's a C average and that should be good enough because not everybody is good at school some people aren't good at math , English , science , health , geography . so just because we cant a B in every class we cant get a B we cant participate in athletics?? That is a total out rage to all athletes and coaches because some of the best players on the team try their best in school and all the school subjects so just because they tried their best but still cant pull off a B they cant play that's not right.

Another reason why u shouldn't consider this new policy is because if you want your school to win a championship and get cool stuff for your school then you have to realize that the best players on the teams sometimes cant pull of a B in every class. And every team needs their best players to come up and play because without them no hard feelings but the teams might suck including your team. And playing without your best player is ruff trust me.

Im one of the captains of my basketball team and the best i can pull off in class is a C and trust me i do try to do my best sometimes the great basketball players arent good at school but im positive when i speak for the basketball players on every team that if one team member goes down others show up and play harder but that's sometimes not enough but like my coach says all for one and one for all.

I don't agree with the grade B average, many students have C's and B's. It's not easy keeping it above at least a 80. Things change in class easily and new things start so it drops our grade.

None of the students agree with this rule, some of our best players have a C average and you would be kicking them off the team by doing this.

Many of the students and I are trying to get you to change your mind about making us keep above a B average, it isn't fare to our good players even our ok players we need our players. And if all the players have at least one C there wont be a team since you kicked them all off of the team. Then what will we do? We wont have a team to represent our school, and we need that we can't not have a team. As I know many of the basketball players have a C average and also our best player does too.

Who would u like to not have sports? Many children at this age should be exercising and doing fitness. Students should be able to participate in any sport in which they please to be in.

There are many reasons why students should be able to be in sports no matter what there age. One reason is that the United States of America is statically the fattest country in the world. This means that in order for us to change this we need the future generation to be fit. The next reason is that if you are overweight your chances of a health disease are higher than a person who doesn't have health issues. My final reason is that exercise is a great way to expand your mind and relax after a stressful day.

After what many people have seen it is all true, the United States is the fattest country in the world! In fact i myself am overweight and many of my other friends are to. In a nationwide statistic it showed that 83% of people in the United States are either overweight or obese. It is a disgrace that we are the fattest country in the world. How would you like to be part of the fattest country in the world?

My next reason is that exercise can actually expand your mind and release stress. My mom comes home from work everyday to a point where she cant even think. After she finishes her daily workout she is as loose as a goose. Nothing can get her aggregated because the exercise has cleared her mind of all negativity. In the Jersey Journal it explained how 3 out of 5 people who do exercise after a long stressful day at work are healed of there frustration. Don't you want to be at peace?

Finally people who are overweight and obese have a better chance of getting a health disease. I am overweight and i was diagnosed with high cholesterol. Its not a fun thing to have because you cant enjoy the fun of eating junk food with all your friends. In Fox 5 news it showed how 95% of people who are overweight or obese have health diseases. Do u want a health diseases.

All of my reasons are a good reason why not to take sports away from students that are not B students. Getting health diseases, everyone being overweight or obese, and not being able to release your stress are all good reasons why. America will not get skinnier by sitting on couches watching T.V.

If it doesn't work, try to make the prize or reward a little more wanted. Maybe randomly give off a electronic device, like an iPod or a laptop to one lucky person every semester.

How can this B average be taken care of?

I think what you have recommend is out of the question.

we as the students can hardly maintain a C average as it is.

I am here to speak up on this selfish idea.

first, many children have a hard time keeping up in class to have a b average just to play something that they desire to play. second, how can we keep up with sports home work and maintaining a b average.

last but not least, how we have a lot of things to worry about at home and then a another plate is on our shoulders. how can we do all this at once first, many children have a hard time keeping up in class to have a B average just to play a game they desire to play. I have a b in language arts that i trying to keep up with and, doing cheer leading is hard enough. how would you feel if some one told you that you have to do something that is difficult enough to maintain. trust me i trying my best with this new rule you just came up with. how can i do this with no help?

second , how can we keep up with sports homework and maintaining a B average. it not impossible its just unreasonable. if you think you can joggle each of the thing us kids are trying to do in our time you'll think oh they got us bet. think about the little things yall do to us waking up going to school doing class work go home do some home work and go to practice. this is a lot to do under a little amount of time now we have to maintain THIS UNREASONABLE task you have us trying to perform last but not least , we have lots of things to do and you putting to much on our shoulders. we try and try and try to met you adults needs but i guess it not working. we push our self's and complete your task now its time to complete our don't give us the B average idea it way out of our young minds let us stay with the C

You cant stop a child from doing something they love just for not making the grades that you want them to make. I agree grades are very important more important than sports nut you still half to let them play both things can help you in the future. There are a lot of boys and girls that will be very upset if they cant play there sports and that they are still passing.

Dear Principle:

It is my understanding that you have decided to change the school policy. I do not agree because all students should have the opportunity to participate in sports. All students should have the chance to decide if they want to participate in sports even if they have a C average grade. There has never been a grade requirement for sports because all kids have the ability to play.

All students have the ability to play because you don't need to Math or English to play soccer or any other sport.

Kids just play to have fun. Students from many different cultures interact and learn when they are playing. I understand that studies come first but what if your child had a C average? I am sure that you would want him/her to have fun and play any sport they want to play and have fun with their friends.

Thank you for your time. If you want to talk more about this idea please contact me at PHONE_NUMBER.

I don't think that you should change the policy to ""all students should have a ""B"" average to do sports or other activities"" ,because the students really loves the activities they do. i know that because I'm one of those students who loves the activities that they do for the school they go to every day. I think that if you have a high ""C""

you should be able to do the activities that you are doing. but i believe that most of these activities really motivate the students to keep there grades up, because i know for a fact that if you in any activities there parents, teachers, coaches will tell them that cant do the activities they doing because of the grades they have in there class. If the students didn't have no activities i really think that will be failing

Students that have terrible grades i think that they shouldn't do any extra activities until they at least bring that grade up to a high ""c"". but i really disagree with your change but its your decision to chose to change the policy or keep it the same. but also go look what the other student said about this policy.

BFBD47C22FB3,"I think making students have a b average to do sports or other activities is a bad idea. not every student can get or maintain a b average. getting c is a average grade, not a bad grade its an average grade.

It shouldn't be looked at as a bad grade.

It would be a different story if you wanted to change i from a d average to a c average. I think it would be okay then. But not a c to a b.

Also more people get a c average than a b average so there wouldn't be as many people going out for the sports teams for other activities. Because they wouldn't be aloud to or they didn't want to put the hard work out to get a b. In my opinion its kind of discriminating against people with lower grades. Maybe sports is the only thing they can do. Or if they had problems in math, science, English or social studies and could only get a c, they wouldn't be able to play the sport they love or go out for an activity they love.

February 1st

I personally think that by you changing the school policy it would make it hard for all the people that enjoy sports with a ""C"" average to even enjoy the activities . I believe that you should not change the school policy because the most kids that enjoy playing academic sports such as Basketball, Track , Cheerleading, Football, soccer ,etc. they wouldn't get a chance to play because the new rule you trying to enforce . I think sports isn't just for everyone with a "" B"" average it should be for everyone that would like to play as long as the have a good grade point average.

As far as the new policy goes I disagree because i feel everybody should be able to participate in activities . This is their time to represent with good character and attitude and also have fun and enjoy their time at school . Instead of not being able to play for having a ""C"" grade point average . They have shown effort and that is all that is required is that all students show effort. This makes Learning and education more interesting.

Also I feel as though it helps to keep the students motivated and on the right path knowing they have a reward to look forward to as the go on the field or the track or court. This keep their confidence goes up and the are more energetic to learn and be ready to work and other thing . I also disagree that the new policy be in place because not all people have a passion for the same thing and not all students can keep a ""B"" average while working or while playing a sport . This is my opinion on why i believe we should keep our current policy and the both ""B &C"" average students play sports as well as the others .

Thanks You for listening and taking my thought into consideration on changing and keeping the policy accurate . I believe this will help all students to stay focus . Last I think this policy is a motivator because it will help them to accomplish more than what the thought they could.

In my opinion being needed, I don't understand why students here should have to have a grade B average. Playing sports isn't really needing to have to be one a certain grade level, it's all about your fitness and how well you play for your school.

If I were a principal I wouldn't make people have good grades as they make you have now because it really isn't about how well your grades are it truly is all about your achievment. Playing sports isn't really ever on how well you do in your classes anywho because it's a sport, you play it as a team, and if you aren't that good you do it to gain fitness and become tougher. I could sort of see why you have to have good grades thought just because whenever you're playing a sport it's with a school team, so therefor you have to be a good role model for your teamates rather then getting in trouble all the time and failing every single class. If you're a good player, then act and show as if you are one. If you aren't one, then try your best to show that you can do it!

I have always wondered why the ""policy"" has to be set on whether or not you're making a B average. In my opinion again I do not believe why this has to be this way, I could understand if you were failing because that's just not really exceptiable in my book. Other then not failing I believe you should be aloud to play because the only way I would ever say no is because of a failing F. That just gives not effort. If you passed without any F's then you should be able to play a sport because you still gave effort in what you were doing.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

I have heard the news that you are only permitting students with a grade B average to participate in sports activities. Despite the majority of the school having a grade C average, I fully agree with you. Allowing students to play sports without monitoring their grades is unacceptable. This new rule will instruct students to get what they want by working hard in school for it.

If a student is profound about a sport and just views school as a way to get into sports, they will obviously be practicing their sport rather than doing homework or studying. If students do good in school, then they should be rewarded by playing whatever sport they desire; not the other way around. Academics comes before extracurricular activities, in my view.

Some students might say that they should be privileged to play sports no matter what grades they get, but I believe they should have to work to be rewarded by playing their sport. This new rule you are permitting will allow students to realize and understand the concept of being rewarded for hard work.

I think it would be a great idea to maintain a B average to play sports. Most people have C averages ,so by doing this it will encourage them into making better grades. If we made this policy come true ,then we would more than likely have a better overall school average. All school want to have the best grade point average ,but we could be at the top if we had everybody here make a B average or higher. So when students find out that they will have to maintain a B average or higher to be able to attend in sports they will start studying more making better grades. That is what we all want. So then if all the athletes have a B average ,then we would have a higher school average and be smarter as a school. Now, we have about half of the grade with a C average. Just about everybody in our grade could a have an A average if they really put there mind into working for the better grade. This change will pull up all of those C averages into at least B averages. This will make the school look better. It will also make Houston County look better as a unit. This idea to make athletes maintain a B average is a brilliant idea. I would recommend it to every school. All athletes now are not worrying about the grades as much as there sport; they would rather be better at sports than have a B or even an A average. So it is a brilliant idea to make athletes ,like me, maintain an B average or higher. It would not only help us ,but Houston County. By helping our county it would put us at a higher ranking and help us prepare for college. So i believe this would be an awesome thing to do!

I believe that you should have students should have to reach a certain grade if they want to play on sports teams.

Students deserve to participate in school activities also because most students have favorite things to do and maybe they need some time away from all the school work and test and at those activities they can have fun and enjoy themselves. this policy would be very unfair and an insult to students without a B average or higher because every student should be able to do school Activities and Sports unless they did something very bad in school.

In my opinion I am for the principles new policy for students to have at least a grade B average to participate in school activities. This school policy will then encourage more kids with averages less than B to do better. Students will then study more, get good grades, and not fool around during class time. If the students in the school look good then the school itself will look good.

When students hear about this new rule that will then change the way the act in school. If They want to participate in school activities they will change. Then instead of fooling around during class they will, then pay attention in class, ask questions, and take notes. If they take notes then when it comes to taking test's and quizzes they will pass the test or quiz.

The students will study more. Kids obviously don't study for tests. They know even if they get an F on the test they will still be able to participate in school activities. Now if the new policy takes place, and they get an F on the test they wont be able to participate in any sports or school activities. So students will then know to study more.

If students who get B' s and A' s on tests they are the ones who are good in class and don't need help. Those who get lower then B' s really need help. So while the students who have good averages are playing and having fun the other students will be learning. The teacher will understand why they have been getting low grades, and teach them at their level. Eventually they will understand and will be getting high marks.

I am for the principles new policy of having at least a B average to participate in sports or school activities. This new rule will encourage students to be more productive in class, and to study more. However if the new policy did not happen then everything will be the same. Students will be continuing to fail, not paying attention in class, and just not being productive enough. If the students in the school do not look good then the school will not look good, but if the students do look good then the school will look good. More and more students will come to this school, and they will be getting good grades.      ",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
08A03F44195D,"dear principal, i highly disagree with having to have a B average in order to play sports. i disagree because a c meets the standards and not everyone is bright enough to exceed the standards and i don't think it's fair to have students make a B or better. another reason is because the teams may not have enough players to play if everyone needed a b average.

the first reason, i disagree with the principal is because a c meets the standards and it's a passing grade. therefore students should be able to get ac and still play sports. also a B is exceeding the standards and all students aren't bright enough to have an exceeding grade that might deserve to be on the team.

simultaneously, the teams may not have enough players to play if everyone needed a B average because everyone cant get a B average. then by the ti8me that everyone gets their grades up the season will probably be over. plus half of the students that do have their grades at a B average might not want to play the same sports that most others do want to play so that would make it even less players eligible to play for the teams.

in conclusion, this is why i disagree with the principal and their decision of making students have to have a B average in order to play sports. one reason is there may not be enough players and another reason is its not fair. this is why we should able to play sports if we don't have a B average.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I am writing you this letter because of your new policy you are considering on passing for sports. I know many people on school sports team's, i myself do not participate in school sports. I participate in out of school sports. But many friend's of mine are on the school's volleyball team, basketball, cheer leading, and football team's. I know they enjoy their sport very well, but if you make the change from having a C average to participate, to a B average most kid's will not be able to enjoy their sport anymore. All lot of us kid's have C average's.

But i believe if you make take away sports from C average people you may not have any school team's anymore. I don't think that your grade average should be able to take you off the team. I know that your probably thinking i shouldn't have a say in this since i don't play school sports. But i do play out of school sports like volleyball, tennis, bowling, and some other sports just to name a few.

I don't want to see my friend's being kicked of the team just because they had a bad day, boomed a quiz and it brought down there overall grade in the class. I can tell you one thing that i know many people who play sports that, that is all they live, breathe, and eat is sports. They practice everyday even when there not at a team practice they practice with friends and family to achieve there goal and be good in the sport that they love.

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I know you are currently deciding whether or not to change the school policy from having a grade C average for being able to participate in sports or other activities, to having a grade B average. This will not be the better choice. Many students now are even struggling to get a grade C average. Changing the policy to a grade B average will hopefully improve grades in these student who wish to play sports at school, or any other activities. But it is still a bad idea. Changing this policy may decrease the number of players on the teams.

I know that all principles want their students to represent there school in a good manner. This leads to public school games, such as football and basketball. If students on teams can't at least get a B average, this will lead to less players that are playing. As the number decreases, this may lead to an automatic loss because there are not enough players to participate. This would be a real shame if it happened all because of the decision of changing the school policy. I have seen this before at my old school, and how it effected the school. In order to keep a stable amount of players, i notify you not to change the policy. Even if students aren't on teams, this is still a big struggle. Yes it means working harder than usual, but some students have other things to do after school besides trying to bring there grades up with hours of studying and doing homework every night. If you do take the chance of changing the school policy, it can effect many with other things to do in there free time while not at school.

However, this is the decision i would take of not changing the policy. The only good it will do is bring grades up for those students who aren't as busy as some other people may be. Don't you want to see improvement in ALL of your students? I hope you do.

I think students should have at least a B average because most students who have a C average is on a football team, soccer team, baseball team or some other kind of school activity or sport. Some athletes may be the ''star'' of their team but have a C average because he does not study his school work but he would practice his sport whenever he got a chance. I know for a fact that most parents who have a ''star'' athlete may not really care about what their child gets in school except maybe gym class.

Most students with an A or B average is most likely not on a sport. If a student wants to be in a school activity he or she must have a B average because if they are on student council or something else they probably will make a bad decision for the school. My final reason is if students who sign up for school events who have a B or A

average will not be picked first by students because they are not the popular students. So, I think all students who are on a sports team or in school activity should have a B average.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

But most people have more of a C average, we all aren't honor students, we get a C once and a while. that would be unfair if all of us got penalized for getting a C average, it is still passing. it would be more fair to have at least a C average to participate.

A lot of kids use school sports to get away from home and to relax and have fun, i for sure have fun in marching band which is technically a sport i could get penalized for if i have a C average, I actually do have a C average, So i wouldn't be allowed to get out socialize and have fun with people who share the same interests as me? With your policy no i wouldn't. I think you need to give us kids a break and let us have fun, I do realize we don't necessarily make your job a walk in the park either. But maybe we would give you a break.

We love our activities, Some of us play basketball.

Your idea for changing the average from a B letter grade to a C letter grade is a very good idea.

Some people would extremely disagree with your plans to get the students grades up I agree to the fullest.

I would go along with the changes you wish to make because in doing so the students would work harder, they would have to set good goals, and get all their work done on time.

One reason why I agree with your changes is because students wouldn't work as hard as they needed to get a B grade.

Many students think that if they get a C it would be the same if that grade was actually an A or a B.

They would think it was the same because they would get treated the same by their coach or team mates because as long as they have a C they get to be part of a team.

Although the parents of these students might not be as happy with their child getting a C, the child wouldn't really mind because they still get all the privileges as the kids that are getting an A or a B.

The second reason I agree with your thoughts is because if the students can get by with a C then they would just be at the border of a C grade and wouldn't set any goals for themselves.

If students are doing well, then will probably want to keep it up and do better.

They can do that by setting goals for themselves.

For example, if a student has a C then their goal will probably be just to keep up with that C because they wouldn't have to do any better.

The third reason why I would go along with your ideas is because it would get the students to turn in their work on time and actually do the work to the fullest.

If a student turns in an assignment and gets a C because there is poor work done the student would not care as much because they would still have a C average and get to participate in sports.

Another reason why changing a C grade to a B would be affective is because they have to do the work to get that grade.

By actually doing the work the student or students would learn more if they are the type of student who learns by doing.

If they do it wrong on the assignment then they would probably get a question like that wrong on the quiz or test.

Although many students might give you a hard time for changing the system, or talk inappropriately about you behind your back, I am right there with you.

They are the ones who are deciding whether or not they get to part of the team by proving themselves in their classes and getting at least a B average.

For the reasons of working hard, setting goals, and actually getting work done the right way students should have to maintain at least a B average to participate in sports.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

Most students argue about being kicked out on a team because of their grades, they think that grades aren't important in their lives but later on it might will, depends what you want to do in their life.

I personally agree with both but more I agree with doing well in school first. Like other parents say ""School comes first"" and its actually true sometime. Most people think school is just a place to be with your friends and joke around, but clearly you can joke around with your friends and also learn about what your going to do with your future life too. When students want to be a professional player in sports you need to have a scholarship for college if you want to be in football, baseball, basketball, and much more activities. College is something that everybody is proud of, like your own parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and much more family members. I have friends tell me all the time that they want to be in the NFL or in sports but when they do school work, they don't do well or they don't want to do the work that they assign to them.

Letting students participate if the have a grade B average is a good idea. This allows the hard working students to enjoy themselves. While it gives the average grade students to study and learn more to raise their grade. This also gives students motivation to do better in school which is better for the students future. Lastly those are some reasons why letting kids with only a B average and above participate in sports is a good idea.

Did you know statics show that children who have average grades who don't do sports at school earn better grades about 65% of the time? This amazing statistic shows how this great concept allows students to focus on their studies more and get better grades. This means that all the students will have brighter futures which is what we all want right? Lastly those are some statistics that help support this concept.

Another astonishing fact is that now that the students are motivated to do more schoolwork they'll learn more and listen more. This makes the teachers job much easier which is a great bonus in addition to students grades getting better. So now you know how it makes classrooms more quiet and an all around better learning environment. Which is a very great thing. This all goes back to the students earning themselves better futures which is something that can be understood world wide.

Now because they learned more in school they'll have acquired the knowledge to run buissneses and our country. Now that's something of the utmost importance. So now that we've given the students the tools to be successful our country could stand strong and proud. Now that is a great thing.

I know that you are thinking of changing the school policy so that students can only participate in sports or any other activity unless they have at least a grade B average. You said that you would like to hear students' opinion on the situation, so I am telling you that I do not agree because of a C average is still passing, and what if by holding a student back just because they don't have a C average or higher, you stunt their growth? I will also explain these reasons in depth.

Firstly starting off, a C average is still passing. Some students are not capable of just getting A's and B's. Some students get C's on a regular. Now if the student is getting a D, then I would agree with you. A D is passing, but just barely. And what principal would want a student in their school that is great in sports and every club possible, but is just barely passing in their grades? To me, that is embarrassing and I understand why you would suspend them fro, participating in sports then, but otherwise, I find it terribly wrong.

Another reason is, what if by holding a student back just because they don't have a C average or higher, you stunt their growth? As I mentioned before, in order for some students to learn to do the right thing, they need to be suspended from certain things, but for other people, it does no good. If a student is getting a D or lower, you should sit them down along with their guardian and talk with them about how if they want to continue to be in a an activity or sport, they will need to get their grades up. And then if they choose not to do so, then it is their own fault because you did your part in trying to help them.

In conclusion, by explaining this to you, I hope that you understand that by changing your school policy to where as only people with a B average or higher can participate in an activity. You could be preventing the next richest person in the world, or better yet, the President of the United States. As you can see, changing your school policy to only allowing students with a B average or higher is unfair and could possibly be classified as stunting one's growth.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
3DFC27F27E29,"Us students work very hard to obtain our grades and keep them at the appropriate letter grade. The new proposed rule stating that students need a B or higher in order to be allowed to participate in after school activities is unneeded and worthless. It will only make the students mad and unwilling to do their work or keep up their grades. By taking away any sport or activity some students loose motivation and let their grades slip, this will be a more common occurrence if the school continues with this rule.

It is proven in scientific studies that active lifestyles help the brain do a better job in the classroom. So why take that help away? I have already stated that taking away a students motivation will cause more harm, but taking away its ability to function will make matters even worse. A survey states that students who are involved with a sport or special activity have higher grade point averages than those students who are not involved. If this rule sticks our students will soon be doing a far worse job in keeping up grades and attendance.

I believe that the school should come up with a compromise for the students on the topic of grades. For example, if the student has been failing the class or barely passing it for several weeks, they should be temporarily cut off from the sport or activity.

Taking away all means of exercise, whither it be physical or mental, can be very disappointing to the schools outlook. Therefore, that is why the rule should be changed or made better, for the overall outcome of the school as a whole.      ",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I believe taking away sports or other activities for students with less than a B average will not be helpful to them because school activities help students, sports are healthy, and studying all day can be stressful.

I think school activities are helpful to students.

Some teach kids to be responsible and others teach them to be creative.

If you are working on the school yearbook you can become very creative and it will benefit them in the future.

Jobs require some creativity such as being an artist or musician.

Taking this away will not help them.

Secondly sports are healthy and get students active.

It is a healthy alternative to watching television or playing video games.

It is also a fun way to pass the time with friends.

Some people may think sports will distract students minds and keep there grades low. When you do some activities such as sports you become less lazy.

Some students don't do homework because they are lazy. This will help them.

Studying or working all day with no fun can be stressful.

Students need some type of fun and these school activities are the healthiest.

If you take these away it will lead to stressful students and students doing unhealthy activities to pass the time such as watching television or even doing drugs.

If you do that many children won't be able to participate in after school activities, true they will work harder to get in after school activities but some are crucial to their grade therefore lowering their grade thus making it where they can't go thus lowering their grade even more.

Though it might raise the grade students will not like it. You wouldn't like it either if it affected you. The students also need the responsibility it gives them for trying hard on the field if it makes them feel more responsible that will make them work harder. On the field they might be learning more than during school hours like on plays they need to know math to calculate the feet and yard it'll get them so it can raise their math average. In some plays they have long names improving their vocabulary thus helping them in language arts improving their grades. In robotics(for science)

will expand their knowledge for wiring therefore knowing how to make stuff with electricity for projects to help all subjects raising their grade. On the field they have to learn the history of that sport improving their history not necessarily their grade.

I object to your policy change in taking away our sports and other activities. We students should be able to have a another chance in trying to bring our grade. Yes we all should have done better but we may have reasons why we have a C average. We need these activities and sports because it helps get through our day. We have the opportunity to do sports and not have to worry about homework or class. If you take away our activities and our sports then nobody would enjoy school much our put any effort into their work.

We all love our sports and activities and we want to keep them because it's a part of us. if you kept these activities and sports then maybe we would want to do better in our classes and we would do everything we can to change your mind. We ask of you to leave our activities so that we have something to keep pushing us in doing our work and keeping our grades up. Students join these activities so that they can enjoy themselves in school. Your policy would take away what we students love doing.

These sports help us take our anger out on whatever sport or activity we joined in. Imagine if you do take away our sports students would take their anger out on others or themselves. Sports and activities are a good way for students to relax and concentrate on their life. Students love doing these things to do something other then go home and sleep. These activities or sports helps them get active with world and people around them.

These activities or sports are like our hobbies. If we don't have them then we can't be active in our school because school is always going to be about learning and doing class work and homework it's also about where were heading in life and these activities can help us think about it or find what we were meant to do.

This is why you shouldn't take away our sports or activities they make a huge matter in the students life's and they love doing these activities it's what makes them , who they are. Those who have a grade B average can do whatever they want and not get kicked out of their activities but think about the others who tried their best not to fail any of their classes but yet they receive a C ?

For kids who love sports that have a C average in grades can not participate. These kids might have a C average because they don't do well on tests but pass in most of there work. The reason i say most of there work is because every kid no matter how well they do in a classes forgets at least one page of work. What if they had a B average but they had one bad grade and turned it in to a C average I don't think that would be fair. What if a teacher wrote in the wrong grade by accident and that turned a students grade to a C average. They might have even done it but left it at home or a sibling might have gotten a hold of it and wouldn't give it back.

To come up with a policy I would have done what most of the students have for a grade average. For example if the majority of the students have C averages in stead of students having

B averages i wouldn't think that would be fair. I would have said to participate in school sports or other activities the students must at least have a grade C average. What if sports was the only way they were going to be able to get into a college. You would just have taken away a chance for a student to go to college.

I really think this unfair to many students who try there best in school.

Students that have a ""C"" or above should be able to participate in sports . I think that having a ""C"" or above is average and that having a ""D"" or lower should not participate in sports because it is not passing the standard's . People who have ""C"" s and higher should be aloud to play sports because they are meeting the standards of the school . This new rule is not very helpful at keeping students fit because they are not aloud to do any sports because they have a ""C"" in there classes . If students with a grade of ""C"" were aloud to participate in sports then they would be more fit and know how to keep them self's healthy.

Students with a grade of ""C"" may also not be very good at something they are learning and that could bring there grade down .If the student with a grade of ""C"" really wanted to play sports then he would have to try to do better but in school although he might be giving his 100%.

C266F2FBD7CC,"Dear Principal,

The following change in the school policy, in my opinion would be a positive change. Although the majority of the students have a C average, a required B to be in after school activities would make more sense.

Truthfully , if a student really wanted to participate in an after school activity they would keep there grade up to the appropriate standard. I mean sports shouldn't take away from a students education, a high academic grade should be a students main priority. Plus if the parent or legal guardian found out his or her child wasn't passing at a proper grade average , they will complain to the school board on how their child isn't getting the ""proper learning skills"" they need, when more then likely the student being to occupied with after school activities or other things.

Even though automatically taking the kid out of the team or club he or she is participated in is an option there are other options the school can use as well. Teachers can give the student make-up work to bump up there grade, the school can hold an after school intervention to give students the extra help they need in the first place, or the councilor can call the specific student into their office and give them a warning of what could happen in the future if they don't work harder in school or just straight up ask ""why are your grades so low?"" , and move on from there. Plus the student isn't necessarily getting low grades because of sports, the sports issue is just the conclusion a lot of people jump to. What if the student is having family problems , or what if the student is getting bullied, or other things outside of school , or they just don't understand that a certain subject, maybe he or she is just to lazy to the homework in the first place , there are a million reasons why someone would be to busy or non-focused on homework or class work.

In conclusion , having a B average would be a appropriate change in the school policy , but before just booting the student out of his or her after school club or activity , try and get down to the main point of why he or she isn't focused on there education.

To the principal:

To many schools, a sports team is their main pride. Whether it be football or basket ball, girls or boys, they have brought joy and excitement throughout schools. It is also one of the reasons that let students show their school spirit and, as they say, root for their school.

Recently, you have changed our school policies about the requirements on being on a sports team . It said that you are insisting upon the qualifications of only students with

B average and above to be allowed to participate in sports or activities. It is obvious that most of the students in our school are C averaged. if you are to know this fact, then why did you not change it back, for it is unfair?

Although I agree that C average is quite low, it is not a failing grade. Rather, if you are afraid of the school's reputation, academically, then instead of just ruining the athletic part of it's reputation, we may be able to do something about it. if we can, than we could have extra classes for those who didn't understand anything. it doesn't have to be long, actually. it could be at least once a week. we may also have extra credit, for those who really need it. Maybe, there is a reason why that child is not doing well. We do have a guidance counselor in our school, so if one has any problem they can ask for help.

As said previously, the requirements for only B average and above students are cutting down most of the school's population, and with the chance that many B averaged students do not want to participate in extra-curricular activities, it could mean that not many people are on the team.

Keeping this in mind, we should know that with few players it is hard to participate, let alone play, in competitions and tournaments.

Also, I would like to clarify that students who are willing to participate in sports and activities must have some interest in it. It is not likely that a student would become part of a club or game that he/she is not happy with. As teachers, you should be able to help your children with being able to succeed. Is this helping ain any way possible? Helping a child achieve their goals and nourish them in their environment is a part of a teacher's requirement and with what you are demanding, it would not be possible. they would not learn necessary things in life, such as teamwork, the thought of succeeding, trying you best, being ok if they lost, etc.            ",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
DE2DAA2A9345,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

Our sports teams are already small as they are with the failing grade policy.

With the new change in policy the teams will shrink dramatically unless the grades rise of the athletes.

However that is not a safe bet because the average grade is a C and averages are hard to raise.

Even though I am not on a sports team I am still writing this to help our sports teams be better with grades and sports.

If this grade plan falls through it will possibly not only destroy our sports teams and their records but possibly cause chaos in the academic field. It may because the athletes need to blow off steam or give them exercise to not only their muscles but also the brain.

There is even science that proves that exercise helps development of a healthy and strong brain.

Now that does not say its useless.

A better plan of action for this would be having weekly grade meetings with the coach.

Then the next step is having the parents actually get up and check on the grades of their children.

Another step and the most important one is if the child or children have a lot of homework or work the parents will enforce the law of whether or not the child stays home and studies or goes to practice.

For this, argument I would say would be weird because most kids in our school try to get good grades, but its really hard for them to do it. The three things that I will talk about is obesity, having fun, and how it would be good/bad in our school if he/she did taking away activities.

If the principal would take away activities, how would we change the obesity rate in this country. Our obesity rate is getting bigger because kids don't do activities as much as they did back then, and today people are always dyeing from obesity. Many people are trying to lose the weight by having to jog or us kids joining an after school activities. Parents always would let there kids sign up for activities so they can make new friends.

BOOM ,RUN, KICK,SCORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That's the good game of soccer and people having fun and well the old American tradition. Mostly people always do activities and always having fun and that's the whole point of it. Many people in different countries don't have the experience we do. Plus we shouldn't just toss it away like that. Many people in Africa don't even of a ball to play anything and we have that great opportunity to do that.

It would be a good thing for kids to have no activities and to do it on there own time, but it would be really something if kids don't have the time and money to play any activities so they don't do it after all. Some of the reasons it would be a bad thing is that kids would be obesied and kids wouldn't make new friends at all

I think that the newly proposed rule may have advantages and disadvantages.

It will ensure that only those who are willing to do the work and try hard will appear on the sports teams and academic groups, bettering the program. Yet I also feel that this pushes the boundaries of the 'no pass no play' rule very far. I think that students should have a choice in this yet I can't help thinking that this would help solve problems, so i am forced to vote for this new rule. those who aren't willing to do the work in order to compete obviously don't care much or they would aim for that higher grade and try harder. This will teach them a valuable lesson in life. Think, what would happen in your life as an adult if your boss told you that he needed you to do something he needed done. Many would say yes in order to please their boss. those who are not willing to work hard to do what even extra activities would probably not be willing to put out the effort for a job. what happens then? You are fired! This would show them to put more effort in order to succeed. the newly proposed rule is a wonderful idea, and will eventually provide the educational system with a higher amount of success in individual schools.

Not everyone has the ability to get a B average. If they try as hard as they can, and still don't get

Other activities are also good because it boosts peoples confidence and they can make new friends. Grades are not the only important thing in this world.

Where the world is right now, obesity is taking over. It is mostly from fast food, but also a lack of sports, but if they eat fast food and play sports they wouldn't be obese. People shouldn't have to suffer from getting lower than a B average, since C is average. If someone has lower than a C average, they should have to suffer from not being able to play sports, or do any other activities. Then they would be able to work harder on there period of no sports or any other activities, and concentrate on there school work.

Some people just can't get good grades, like in the B average range, but they work as hard as they can to try to not to get lower than a B average. If they enjoy this one sport, or this one activity, i don't think they would enjoy not doing it, though it would make them work harder, so they can play again. Sports and other activities take up time, which students could be using that time to study or do homework, though they have time to do there homework or study either before and or after practice.

My opinion on your policy change is positive. I really like the idea that students really have to work hard in order to play an activity. There are many reasons on why this should be approved. One reason is that no coach would want a knucklehead on there team. Another reason would be that the kids who have bad grades would want to get good grades.

The first reason I stated is that no coach would want a kid who messes around and doesn't listen to them. Usually students that get higher grades listen more than students who get C' s, D' s, and F' s. That means the students who have good grades can learn the sport better. I think their parents would also agree.

`

Another reason is that the kids who really want to play sports, but have bad grades, would encourage them to get good grades. Lets say a student had many D' s in almost every class, but really wanted to play sports. This new policy would make the student get a good grade if he really wanted to play a sport. Many other people would agree too.

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME. I agree with what you are doing to the school policy. An education is important for future life. It is more important than playing sports for your school. If a student wants to play sports, he should have at least a B- average. What happens if you end up getting kicked out of the sport and are forced to get a job. Most of the good paying jobs won't accept you without a certain degree whether it be bachelors or doctorates. You need the grades for the high paying jobs. Colleges usually review your grades before they let you play on their team and let you attend their college.

If the student really wants to play on the school team, then s/he should be taking his/her grades and education seriously. Until s/he is in college that student should have to get at least B averages. Let him/her get on the team even if his/her grade is 3 points under a B, but make him/her get his/her grades up or s/he gets cut off the team. If s/he doesn't have a B average come the semi- championships/championship games, s/he gets benched. Even if s/he is the best player on the team. That way there is some incentive to keep the grades up- or get them up.

In conclusion, I believe you are doing the right thing by changing the school policy.

It is outrageous that you think students should have at least a B average to participate in sports or other activities! This is wrong because kids need more exercise, they need something to feel proud about, and they want to make friends on teams or clubs.

To start off, kids need something to be proud of. They may not be smart or maybe they just don't like their teacher. If they are not that smart, they feel stupid in front of their parents and friends. Being on a sport's team or in a club would make them feel like they accomplished something. For instance, kids may be getting a C average but they are the best actor in the drama club or have the best arm on the football team. Getting bad grades shouldn't make them feel like they don't have a purpose in life but rather signify that their purpose in life is not to be a rocket scientist or a chemical engineer but to use their skills to entertain their family, friends or fans.

Next, kids these days need more exercise. Most of them sit around playing sports video games when they can be out playing the real thing! For some kids, the only exercise they get is in gym class or on sports. I'm sure parents would rather have their kid playing linebacker instead of pretending to be one on Brett Favre's team. Also, kids can meet random people playing video games and may want to meet them in the real life. With voice changer technology, people can make their voice sound lower or higher, matching a kids voice.

Last of all, kids want to make friends! Their not going to make any real friends watching Spongebob dance around under a rock, they are going to make friends that have the same interests at them, such as a forensics club. If kids sign up for forensics, they will meet other kids that like it too. They go to different schools in the area. They could make friends in all of these schools! They all like forensics and, who knows, maybe they have something else that they all like to do.

To conclude, students who have lower than a grade B average (which is many of them) would miss out on that ""proud"" feeling, they would have a hard time making friends, and they wouldn't be getting most of the exercise that should be getting.",5,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

If you played on a team wouldn't you want to have good, honest citizens?

Why would you want to play with the people who get bad grades and invariably get in trouble?

I know I wouldn't want to.

To play on a team there should have to be only the people who get good grades.

I believe that if you are on a team that you should have to have good grades and a spectacular record.

One reason why I think people should have to get good grades to be on a team is because that way you only get the dedicated students.

I say that because if they have to get a B- average you better they probably have to work hard to be on the team.

That is a good thing because then they will be dedicated to their team and their school.

Also I think it is like that in college, all the super good athletes in college have to get good grades to play.

If they don't get good grades then they can't play.

It should be like that in middle and high school.

If the athletes want to be on the team they have to get good grades.

A recent study said that if a school has this policy the school's grade point average is 24 percent higher than school without.

That is quite a significant jump up and I think it shouldn't be ignored.

Another reason I think that we should do that is because then you get good all- around citizens.

If they have to get good grades then they are dedicated to their school. Also if the athletes play then they are dedicated to their team.

When or if the school changes that policy, I think we should also add that the athletes have to have a good behavior record.

That way they have to get good grades, be an athlete, and good behavior.

Add that up and you get an all-around good person.

I believe that our school should change that policy to a B- average.

Many of us kids think that it is unfair to only let kids with a ""B"" average to play.

E80959E551E1,"Dear Principal,

I think students should have at least a B average in school to be eligible to participate in school sports. If you make this a rule then students would work harder in school and get better grades. This would improve their GPA. Having a higher GPA will open up more choices for the student. These choices may include going to college or University. Sometimes sports do have an effect on students' grades because they have practice and games in the afternoon and don't have enough time to do homework or study for a test. If you do change this school policy then kids would try to open up more options to try and have their homework in on time and get a high score on a test.

If students join a school sport or activity the reason is usually because they love or have a passion for that sport or activity. Maybe it expresses who they are or just gives them something to do. The point is that the students join by choice and its their responsibility to keep up the good grades. When the students find out about the new policy (if you change it) they will work really hard to get their grades up or, if they already have good grades, keep their grades up.

Now I know that some students are going to argue against this new policy. Things they might say are ""Oh, I don't have enough time after practice to do my homework/ study for a test."" or ""Keeping a B average isn't that easy to do."" Well it isn't easy. And to solve this problem the kid might consider getting a tutor to help them out in school. When they don't have enough time they can come in before school to get their homework done or re-do a test that they failed.

Do you remember when you where a student in Middle school or maybe High School? Do you wish you had done better in school so you could have done better in college or University? This kids still have the chance to do that so you should help them out.

Imagine winning every game basketball game.

But then your star point guard starts flunking tests and his average goes down.

He gets kicked off the team and your team then starts to lose every game.

Well this could be the case if you don't allow students who have a C average to play.

But yet on the other hand, you are also teaching the students a lesson.

Now in my opinion, i think that teaching the students lessons are more important than being the best team out.

Think about this, in college, they give you scholarships for academics and athletics.

But if you play for a team and your grades aren't so well, are they going to keep you on the team?

Probably not.

This is the same as how you should run our school.

We need to prepare for college and by running our school similar to colleges, it will help us to learn how college is ran.

That is the same with activities, you have privileges if you do good.

If you have bad grades, then your privileges, such as participating in activities, will be taken away.

These lessons we learn, will hopefully pay off, such as getting reprimanded for doing something bad.

Do you think someone who is extremely bad, for example someone who is always getting in trouble in school for misbehaving, should be allowed to be rewarded?

Well that is not right because he thinks that he can be bad and do anything he wants and still be rewarded in the end.

He is not being taught anything and it isn't fair.

How would you feel if you were a student who did good in school, got good grades, and tried your hardest while some other student did bad and took the easy way out and was rewarded in the same way?

""Education is the key to success!""

Now do you know who said that?

Our president, Barrack Obama.

What this quote means is that education is what's going to lead us to excel.

So by not allowing students with a C average or lower to participate in sports and activities, there is a lesson being taught. I play sports but yet Part of that lesson is summed up by Obama's quote.

Now based on all this, what's more important- being number one or being educated?

All in all, I feel that you should put your new policy into action.

We need to learn from everything we do.

7AC3F8284F40,"A grade B average to be able to participate in sports or other activities would be a great policy change. This would be a great change for many reasons, but overall it will help better our students knowledge and the school's overall grade review.

To start off, having a B average would be a great policy change because students will work harder and learn more to be able to participate in sports. For example, my school has a C grade average requirement to be able to participate in sports or other extra curricular activities and my friend RELATIVE_NAME is on the basketball team. He informed me he had a D, and after hearing this policy, he repeatedly studied and aced as many tests as he could in order to stay on the team. So if this works for him, it should work for other students who care to participate in other activities. This policy change will also be a good requirement because it will help students participate more in other activities such as advanced placement classes or even tutoring, showing their appreciation. For example, I knew this boy named RELATIVE_NAME in the 6th grade, he wanted to be on the dance team, but discovered he needed a C average, and he really enjoyed dancing. He had an F in language arts, and he decided to bring it up to satisfy his passion for dancing, so he took on tutoring every Tuesday and Thursday to improve his writing skills, and by the end of that very month, he improved his grade to a B and was dancing at performances every week after school. This is just two of many reasons why a B grade requirement to participate in extra curricular activities would be a good thing, because if students work this hard to maintain a C to participate in activities, they would definitely work harder to maintain a B average to participate in school activities.

Another example of why i think this would be a great policy change is because it would help our school overall. For example ,last year my school offered an FCAT boot camp program to help students better their knowledge before a big test, and almost all 7th graders did significantly well, raising our school average to an A overall. So if just one grade level could do it, if all the grade levels in our school required an average of a B, our schools overall outlook would change significantly. Another example of this helping our school overall is that just last week, our social studies class had a mid-term exam, and everyone in the class received a B or higher, and the grade point average of our period raised significantly. So, if the whole school was to maintain a B, our averaged statistics would significantly change as well, just on a higher scale. That is why i think that having a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities would be a great policy change.

In conclusion, making the grade requirement to participate in sports or other activities a B, would be a great policy change because it will show how much students care , and improve their learning skills, and also improve our schools overall grading average.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

The argument of not allowing the students to participate in athletic activities, I believe to be unreasonable. The reasons in which you have decided this are understandable, but not fair. Some students have a harder time understanding the work we are given in class and the teachers don't have enough time to sit down with each one in class or out of class. Therefore some students that participate in these activities don't have a very good chance of succeeding at your requirements. Athletics and other activities that we have in school are the things that keep us from out bursting in class.

I know from having experience that kids need time to be themselves and express themselves through leisure activities or sports. The average grade for most to all school is a C

I don't understand where your going with this if you expect kids to keep up their grades just to play sports. I'm sure that there are other places where kids can play sports and they could and most likely will continue to get the average grade because that's what kind of student they are. Its hard for all kids to succeed in school knowing that all the can do all day every day is school related work. They need to have a break in order to think and process information that they learned the previous night or day. I understand where you are going when you say kids need to have good grades because without them they can not get in to a college and fulfill their goal. School comes first i agree.

I don't agree with the having to have a B average to play sports. Its hard enough for some kids to get good grades but now they wont be able to do something they enjoy if you take that away. This whole issue might result in you not having kids playing sports for your school or having a bad sports team which i don't think or at least hope you don't want. When it comes to kids having bad grades i think you should give them a chance to bring it up i understand if they have a D average but a C is the average grade for most middle to high school students and that wont change. I respect the fact that you want kids to do well at your school but without having sports and maintaining a C average will push them over the edge.

When you think about it most kids are average to above average students and that could be taken away if you take away their privilege to play sports for being an average kid. I know that I have a above C average and this wouldn't affect me, but it would effect my friends and they are excellent at sports. It would take away their one chance to express themselves and their feelings.

I hope you see that this is not a good idea. I don't want my expression and love for sports to be taken away because I'm average. There's nothing wrong with being average.

I believe the you should change the school policy cause if students fail classes they would have to take summer school. You see if all lot of students have C' s in their classes and do sports or other activities. They are more likely to fail because they will be more focus on the sport or the activity then their homework and school work. All the students should have a grade B in all their classes cause if you have high grades and do sports or activities without bringing your grade down you are a great student who can stay focus.

As well as I think having to have all B' s is good but I also believe you should leave it the way it is because many students wont do sports or activities and won't get as active as they need to be. As well as having fun with friends and have good times. Also if you do change it many students will be mad and wont do any school activities.

So here is something you should think about if you do change it not many students will do sports and other activities and will less likely to be happy but if you don't you might have some students struggling with their grades as well as their homework.

I have been told that you wanted to change the policy on the grade students should have to play in sports (if you have a grade C average than you wouldn't be able to play) , and that you also wanted the students views on that. Well I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME and I know for the majority, most kids wouldn't think it fair if you went into action with this policy, and there are other reasons you shouldn't put this policy into action too, here are some of them.

One reason why you should put this policy into action is because if the majority of the students have a grade C average at your school, then SCHOOL_NAME would lose many team members, this policy might make you think it would encourage kids to have better grades, but it might affect the team for those who want to slack off, not even necessarily slack off because a grade C average isn't even failing. Unless you want the school's reputation to go down by losing many games because they have little members, than you could follow through with this policy. But I wouldn't encourage it.

Another reason why I wouldn't encourage putting this policy into action is because a grade C average isn't considered failing, and in most schools for activities they won't let you participate if you are failing, but it would be fine with them if you had a grade C average. Not that we are in competition or anything but I am sure SCHOOL_NAME wants to be represented as a good, cool, and fair school.

Also another reason could be because maybe a student has a grade average C in one of their elective classes, now that definitely wouldn't be fair if someone didn't get to do sports because they had a grade average C in an elective class. Electives are supposed to be a privilege, not something you should base whether they play sports or not. And the fact that they had a grade average C in that class and saying that they couldn't play sports wouldn't be fair because if they aren't even failing the class then they should have the right to play.

These are a few reasons why you shouldn't tell kids they can't play sports if they a grade C average. Think these reasons over and thank you for the time being that you read this letter.

I think that it would be a major mistake to change the eligibility grade for sports from a C to a B. This would punish the kids that want to do good in school and work hard in it but still get bad grades. It would also be punishing the kids that do good in school and play sports because you are depriving them of a winning team, which I know all sports players want.

Kids like me that do great in school and at sports would be missing out. We want to win and we want to win now. And if you are taking away good players, winning doesn't happen. You will lose the respect of a whole lot of kids in this school if you heighten the sports eligibility grade from a C to an B. Like i said before some kids have trouble learning fast and do bad in school. But those kids try to do well most of the time.

I would understand if you wanted to change the average GPA from a 1.9 qualification to like a 2.5, because that means that I could almost fail and still play a sport. That isn't asking enough out of the kids if they can do that.

If you did change the rule, and a player had lower than a B average and he or she played a sport. You should go to that persons teachers and ask them if he/she is putting forth effort to keep grade up, and if they are, than that person should be able to play still. If a kid is doing bad and not putting forth any effort to do well, than he/she should be put on probation until their grades improve. If the grades don't improve then he/she will not be aloud to play or practice with the team until grades improve.

I 100% disagree with this new policy idea of yours for many reasons.

Many students get there home work and protects done but they get like a C grade average on the assignment. It is there choice to redo it or to talk to a teacher if they want or need a good grade. But I don't think you should punish them with sports! say if one kid did an assignment with a friend and they had to go up in front of the class and do it together but your friend was acting like a total spas and dropped your grade to a C (when it was an A) they should do sports but give them time to redo it.

However if one person has a D or an F in math, science, health, or social studies then you should talk to them. See why they have that and how they can improve in that class. And if they don't have that grade up in 2 or 3 weeks talk to them again and maybe kick them out if they arnt doing anything to improve or show that they are making progress don't punish the kids who have an A or a B and even a C.

some people find it hard to fit all this room into homework studying tests and quizzes. so if they have a C that's because they might not have time to do so. some people have school, dance, friends, lessons, sports , piano and etc.

If you go up to 50 students i bet you at least 38 will say and give you an excellent argument on this discussion and say that you as a principle and others of the school faculty should NOT allow D and below grade average to participate in school sports and if they have a C give them lots of time on there hands to redo and update the grade report.

C07B7A0A0AF1,"To the principal,

I think that the proposed policy could have either positive or negative effects, depending on the determination of my fellow students on playing school sports/other activities. To begin, students who are more determined towards playing school sports or other activities may decide to study harder in order to participate, improving their overall grade and making this new policy worthwhile. On the other hand, students may be against it because they do not want to put in the extra work to raise their grade, causing a lack of team members.

First of all, this policy could be an outright success if every student that both plays school sports or other school-related activities and has a C or lower grade average decides to step it up and gets better grades. If this would happen, it would overall, make the school brighter. However, I do not think this is very likely, as there would be, most likely, at least one student who does not want to give the extra effort to play school activities.

However, if little to no students believe they should have to work harder just to play school activities, then this could mean a problem. Because many students do not already qualify for this future-policy, the teams would therefore be much less populated, and this could possibly lead to the teams not having the required amount of members, and thus the students who already meet these requirements would also be punished unfairly. This could then lead to an absence of school sports, and then the activity levels of the students could drastically decrease.

Furthermore, the proposed policy, in my opinion, should be a good idea for the overall benefit of the school, because I believe that most students are willing to improve themselves, if nothing else, for the sake of engaging in school sports or otherwise school-related activities. This is because higher grades could mean grants, and grants could perhaps mean equipment for those sport-players or those who partake in school activities.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
318A8BEC177F,"Dear Principle TEACHER_NAME,

I am writing this as a response letter in response to the new policy you want to put on the students, changing the opportunity to be in sports with only a B GPA or higher. Most of the students think this is unfair, including myself. Here are the three reasons i heard the most among the students...

One reason is that some students try their hardest in class and could only obtain a C GPA average and it's not fair if you give those students a chance to thrive in sports and not to those with a lower score. Most students here want to be in cheer leading, basketball, baseball, flag football, etc. and if some students aren't even given a chance to even try any sports activities then they most likely wont ever again want to try something new.

Another good reason is, if a student is absent for a really specific reason, then they would have to do a lot of makeup work, depending on the teacher, and some teachers refuse to give makeup work and then grade it afterwards. Most teachers say if you weren't here you missed out, especially in P.E, if you missed a mile-running day, you can't make that up unless you come after school or before school and you have to ask your parents if they will be able to take you to make it up, and some parents can't just take off work to something as small as that.

The strongest reason I found among the students was, if for example a student is really good at baseball and the school refuses to take notice of his/her skills simply because of his/her grades, then you would have never know if that student would have been able to get a scholarship for that by a college, or be a sports star... all because of a principles new policy on sports vs. grades.

Changing the school policy to only letting students attend or play sports is good but bad at the same time, it can be good because you should keep up with your school work while your playing sports or other activities. That is the main reason why you are going to school. If you cannot somehow keep up with any of your school work and your getting D' s and F' s then you shouldn't be playing any sports or be in any activities for the week or that period of time. But having as C average and not being able to play sports i think is unreasonable. So having that policy is a good thing. But it can be bad at a certain point because having to have at least a B average is kind of high. I think at least having a C average is pretty reasonable than having to have a B average. If the policy was having to have at least a B average to play any sports or other activities i wouldn't join any of them.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

I think that it is a great idea for allowing students to participate in sports, only if they have a B average. The students will try harder in their classes and most will actually pay attention to the teachers. They would not be focusing only on the sports their play and they would take their time to study. This could help the students to learn a lot more.

The students who play sports would listen to their teachers a lot more if you use this policy. In a poll it showed that 9 out of 10 students who plays sports do not focus on their academics only on the sports they play. If you let student who have a at least a B average to play sports then the student will surely pay attention to their academics. They will feel the need of getting a better grade.

The student will study on tests and quizzes to get a better grade. They would not leave it till the last minute. The students will take the time to learn the stuff the teacher teaches. In a research scientists found that students often do not have good grades because they focus too much on sports.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

Hi

I am in the 8th grade at SCHOOL_NAME. I just had to come to you about the new school policy. I don't like the way you change it because its so unfair to the people who try there best in class , but just cant understand the work. Why not let the people who have a C average in their class participate in their school sports. But I can understand if they didn't try to do any work n make a C average. There should be a way that the people with a C average get a chance to participate in different things in there school. Here are something u can do talk to the teacher bout giving make up work. Staying for the after school program. Having Saturday school for 5hours. So there are lots of things you can do by help the C average people get there grades up if that's what u are real trying to do , but it has nothing to do with participate in sports or other activities. Children just want to do stuff with there life so that they can stay out of trouble and become successful to help their family . So I just want to tell u what i think about this new school policy. Hope u have a lovely and bless day.            ",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

This new policy that you have made is just wrong.

With this new rule applied I can see to many students getting cut from sports.

In your decision you have affected way to many students.

I know people that get a c in at least one or maybe two classes, but making this rule is unacceptable to me because people aren't that smart in every subject.

I would see a lot of rage going through this school and a lot of smack talk about you, and it's all just because you made it so they needed a b average grade in this school.

With this problem you can affect a lot of kids.

You could for instants kick half the players off the football team, then we wouldn't have enough players.

Kicking kids off of school teams could put them in a position where they have nothing to do now.

and results of that could kill a kids self a steam.

A child with nothing to do could cause him to sit on his couch for instants and oh watch T.V.

This could cause them to gain wait and as you say it become fat and then get made fun of.

Making a new policy could even upset the parents.

If this is put into affect in the middle of the year and the kids are kicked off the team or removed, this causes the parents to lose money unless you are willing to give a refund.

Applying this could cause anger and then some students could and will take it out on others for no reason.

I am even affected by this new rule or policy i am not strong in science and i never really have been.

Back to the self a steam part.

Lowering a kids confidence or self a steam is one thing that you should do.

this could make them feel stupid for the fact that they can't even play sports because of this going into affect.

Now this is just me but I'm pretty sure that plenty of others feel the same way about this act. i hope you reconsider what you're doing.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

Many students enjoy playing sports and/or taking part in other activities.

However, not many students enjoy school or working hard.

Students sometimes skip homework and paying attention and instead, focus on other things such as sports, activities, or hanging out with friends.

I believe that requiring at least a grade B average to take part in sports and activities is a reasonable idea because a grade B average is not that difficult to get or maintain, it will boost scores and the knowledge of students at our school.

A grade B average is not a very difficult goal to reach.

It is easier than a grade A average but still harder than a grade C average, providing a challenge for the students.

The students will have a great incentive for wanting to get grades and will work very hard to be able to reach that grade B average.

A grade B average is just an average, meaning that the student doesn't need to have an A in every class to get it.

With this in mind, the students will realize that this is possible and a reasonable policy.

This new policy will greatly benefit the students at our school.

Almost all students love sports or activities with their friends.

With almost all students aiming for a B average, the students will be studying harder and really pushing to get higher grades.

This means that the school will receive a better overall grade average and will rank higher amongst other schools in the state and country.

Students will become smarter from studying and paying attention more in class leading to higher student knowledge and understanding.

In the long-term, the students will have a better understanding of every subject and will grow up to be smart and have bright futures.

A grade B requirement policy will be a wise choice and prove very beneficial to both the school and the students.

The school will be recognised more and receive higher rankings than other schools around the country.

The students will learn double or even triple than other students in the state and country.

Students can mature to be wise and strong-minded adults and could make a name for themselves out in the world.

Having high level businessmen or scientists or mathematicians coming from our school will boost student enrollment and fame for the school.

I believe that this is a fair and very possible requirement for all students at our school.

I am writing on behalf of the kids at our school and the effect of changing the school policy would be on them. Many kids are at a C average in their grades, and can participate in sports. If the policy is changed to a minimal B average requirement, then many students will not be able to participate in sports or other activities. The school policy should not be changed because it would be a lot harder for kids to compete in after school activities, a less amount of students would be representing the school, and there wouldn't be as much control without the influence of extracurricular activities.

Education does come before extracurricular activities. Kids represent the schools in numerous academic ways, including the core subjects. The amount of work given to students is already discouraging and many do not do their best on it, but find they do great in the extracurricular activities. Schools are represented more by kids who are in sports or are in other activities.

Changing the school policy would make it harder for kids to be in sports and other activities. Many kids already find that school is challenging and therefore do not put their best effort into their schoolwork as they do to other activities. We cannot change that fact and it would be silly to punish other kids who get a C average, but that is the best that they can do. Sports and other activities are crucial to the development of the future adults of America.

Changing the school policy would make it so less students represent the schools in other ways besides academics. All kids are not science or mathematical geniuses. They are just regular, average kids who find joy in the extracurricular activities that the school has to offer. A student may not be great in one thing, but may be amazing at another. Why would we want to hurt the development of the students who may find a future career in something other than academics.

If the school policy was changed, then there would be less control and order in the schools. Many kids come from bad homes, and the extra activities offered at school allow them to feel like they fit in and that they can succeed in whatever they do. We are building the future youth of America and changing the school policy would change the future. The extra activities are helpful to stimulate the young minds and keep them out of trouble.

The school policy should not be changed because it would be a lot harder for kids to compete in after school activities, a less amount of students would representing the school, and their wouldn't be as much control without the influence of extracurricular activities. School is a vital place in helping to develop the minds of the youth, but also to help them grow and succeed. Many kids rely on school and raising the policy to a B average would discourage many students. Lets keep the policy the same and continue to help the future leaders of this great country.

I believe that you should not change the school policy so that only students with a B average of better can play school sports. One reason is because most of your students have a C average, and if you change the policy then a majority of your students will not be able to play sports. Another reason is that the students will lose the opportunity to get exercise they need thus leading to unhealthy students. If you change the policy then the amount of overweight children will rise. I think that you should not change your school policy because students will have nothing to do during the time that they play sports, which leads to the loss of productivity. If you change your school policy then students will not have the energy they need to get through the day which leads to laziness and lower test scores for your children. In my opinion you should not change your policy so that only B average students can participate in sports.

It would be fare to other kids if you put "" you cant play any sports unless you have a B average or more"". so many kids probably couldn't play their favorite sports and their parents would get mad enough to have them switch schools. lets put it this way, if you say they can have a C average in their grade the school would be a lot better place and wouldn't be as boring as it is. you could have a really good athlete who does every sport and is a super good running back for the team, real fast and every thing. what happens if he dropped from a

B average to a C average? that's what i am talking about. you can just at least say you have 2 weeks to get up your grades and if you don't then to bad so sad. if you're school is having a big dodge ball tournament after school and you have teams you play with and you have a C average then its really boring for you and your dodge ball team is one man short and they cant play because of you.

Many students rely on sports to push them through high school or pay for a full 4-year scholarship. For some, sports are the only reason they wake up and are excited about going to school. Athletes play after, before and during the school day, but that is no excuse to be having a C-average. Although students can rely on their sports now, but they will not always have the opportunities they do now by playing a sport. Students come to school to learn, not to play sports. Although sports are a great way to spend ones time, it sometimes can get in the way of their school work.

The athletes at our school should not be allowed to play until there grades are brought up to a B-average. This will motivate our athletes to excel in school and also in which ever sport the have chosen. The more they are pushed the more they will learn, therefore if you need C-average just to be on the team, they are only going to try for a C-average. Athletes are not being pushed to get better grades because coaches and parents hope for a great future in sports. Kids dream of becoming a NFL star Quarterback or the new Kobe Bryant but these dreams are very un realistic. One out of every thousand high school stars become professional. If these dreams do not come true and students have had a C-average their whole life, how do you expect them to graduate college with a high G.P.A. and go one to become a successful human being.

In conclusion, I strongly believe education should come before any sports. Students should achieve above and beyond so when the day comes that they are told they cant not play, they have a good back-up plan that will still lead them to success.

I don't agree that you should change school policy so that students may or may not participate in sports unless that have a grade B average. I disagree because some other students struggle in getting a B for an average even if you or your not doing it for sports or other activities. A lot of students on participated with sports or activities have a C average and this will decrease the number of kids who want to play sports or try different activities. i think the grade C average was a lot better because it gave some kids a chance to try and get a better grade to allow them to play sports. If you change the policy a lot of kids might give up trying to get a B average and therefore wouldn't be able to play any sports or activities. If there is an excellent player on a team they will have to really try on their test to get a least a B and if they get below that they get kicked off the team and it couldn't be fair to them or anybody. i don't think that this is a good idea to change the average to a B along with other students who attend sports.

In some sports the best players on the team could be the least smartest and not have such good grades. This may draw conflict with either player, coach, or parents of that child.

Some kids that choose to come to this school could be a big sports junky and not be to smart.

I'm not saying that we should let the kids that are failing classes and still get to start in there favorite sport during school. It's better for a school to be known for its smart children and good helping teachers, but getting that extra look at sports could be a big deal. They're several schools around here that have good sports programs, but some schools around our area could have no sports program and have some of the smartest kids in the state attend there.

I do not understand the fact that you want to change the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

In this letter it explains reasons why I think that your new school policy is unfair.

I feel this is completely unfair because most students in the school have an C average which is very close to a B average. This is also unfair because even though the students are not a B average student they are still passing their classes. They should be able to participate in any school functions because they have worked hard for the work that they have shown thus far.

I think you should change the school policy so that any students that are on the exclusion list can not participate in any sports or any school/ after school functions. I think this is a good idea because if a student is terribly bad but get good grades how would you allow this student to participate in any school functions or even leave out of the school building for trips ? I also think this is a valid point because they must have did something bad to be put on the exclusion list. In my opinion I think that these are very good reasons.

I hope that after you read this letter you would understand the importance of why I think your new school policy is very unfair or disliked. I also hope that i have convinced you to change the school policy to a very good school policy, as the one i have included in this letter.

The gossip is going around, many of students are talking, quite like busy working bee's in a hive. It's everything all the students are talking about. Its the new policy you want. You're considering about changing our school policy towards our athletic department. Many students at our school have a C average. I personally do not agree that to participate in sports students most have a B average. I disagree with you're policy for three reasons. First, a C is an average grade. Second, sometimes the students grade is beyond their control. Last but not least, sports are supposed to be fun.

According to the NEG, National Education Group , a C is an average grade. When a student is at a C they have room for improvement. Nonetheless, they aren't failing either. However a C is still a passing grade. I see why you think students should be above average to be able to participate in sports. On the other hand, you would be depriving more than half of your schools population, who are still passing their class, from participating in sports.

In most occasions, students grades are lower because they don't know or comprehend the material. That could be for several reasons; either the student wasn't paying attention during class, he/she is incapable of learning the material, or the teacher doesn't teach very well. From past experiences, my grades have been lower than my usual standards due to my teacher.

Sometimes, its the teacher who doesn't teach, but rather tries to have the students teach themselves. Also, many students may have diseases such as dyslexia or ADD and they just don't know it. Therefore, those students may be incapable of learning the way the rest if the class does.

For my last reason, sports are a pass time. There supposed to be fun, to pass the time. Athletics should be nothing to have to stress over. I'd rather not do any sports, than stress over having an average grade to be able to participate. Seventy eight percent of students have a C average, a student that falls into that percentage might be the next ""Lebron James""

But with the new policy, you may never know.

Many students are worried that they wont be able to partake in the athletic department at our school. If your policy follows through, many students will be excluded from playing sports. I highly disagree with your policy. First of all, a C is an average grade, the student is not failing with a C. Also, on some occasions it is beyond the students control. Finally, Sports aren't supposed to be a critical situation , they're supposed to be fun.

To get a B in any subject is hard to achieve and all students have one bad subject which means less than ten percent of all students will be allowed to participate in sports and then most children and teens are either athletic or smart only about five percent are both so even less will participate even with those few being allowed to participate in these sports.

In the next paragraph I will explain more on what students will do to participate in sports or other activities and what this does to our school.

I think that the new policy would hurt our school in many ways.

Our students would drop out or change schools to participate in many sports. This could hurt the school as well. Money that comes out of school events that include all sports helps to pay for books and other learning material like paper, pencils, computers, notebooks, computers, and workbooks.

This alone would hurt the school but as I said before children and teens need some sort of activities. To blow off steam or to get rid of some energy. Worst of all if they do drop out or move to a different school the amount of students at the school will drop dramatically as will it's grade point average.

As you can see changing the policy on sports will hurt our school in many ways. Less than half of the students will stay at the school.

The schools grade point average will go down and the school won't have the money to support the few that stay. Eventually the school will be shut down and all the teachers that work their will be laid off.

It is unfair to not allow students to participate in after school activities if the student doesn't get at least a B average.

This completely unfair to students because after school activities allow students to express themselves outside school.

Students are unable to express themselves in the classroom, but after school activities really allow students to be themselves.

It is unfair that school can dictate how a student chooses to express themselves.

Not having after school activities can also affect the student's grades because after school activities can relieve stress with schoolwork, but if that student is unable to have after school activities, and just schoolwork to think about, they would be more stressful with school and it could really affect their focus.

This then could affect the students grades.

A students grade could get even worse without after school activities.

A student's schoolwork, and social life should be kept individually.

After school activities is a great chance for students to relieve stress with schoolwork, and let students to do something outside of school that they really enjoy doing.

Students shouldn't have to focus on school all the time because other activities are just as important in helping a student grow.

I think changing the school policy so that students have to have a grade B average is not really necessary because some kids that have a grade C average could be like one point or two points away from having a B average and they could be one of the better players on the team. Even the whole team or most of them could have a C average so if they couldn't play the team would have to forfeit the game and that could be the game to go to the state play-offs. Some of the kids parents and even the rest of the school not playing sports mite not like that the team had to forfeit the game to go to the state play-offs. So if the principal decides to change the school policy so that the students have to have a B average then he is going to have a lot of angry parents and a lot of angry students blaming him that they couldn't go to the state championship when they would have a chance to win the trophy and even possibly get medals for winning the state play-offs.

I am writing you concerning our possible change in policy. I both agree and disagree with your idea on change the grade level average.

I disagree with you on this term: most of the students who participate in the sport activities have a grade level lower than your expectations. By changing this policy, you are eliminating most of the players who are committed to the sport activities. The majority of the students who also play sports try to keep their grades up, but have a hard time doing so because of the sports, yes. But this does not mean that the students don't care enough to learn. It might be that they do not understand what they are being taught, but they just don't want to voice that they don't understand. The change in policy will only make them feel panicked and their grades will drop even furthe. If they are given the chance to fully understand the lessons, like a private tutor, they will be able to get their grades up and keep them that way, hopefully getting rid of the shyness to voice their misunderstandings. Their performance in school and in the sport they play will be better if the policy is not changed.

I agree with you on this point, however: some students just don't care enough to learn. They would rather be out on the field or shooting some hoops. By changing the policy, you give them a reason to learn what they are being taught. If you eliminate the ability to participate in said sport, it will give them more time to focus on the schoolwork they need to get done. Once they do spend more time on their homework, they will be able to get their grade up to expectations, and hopefully keep it there once they rejoin the team. By having the policy changed their drive to learn will be increased, even if they dislike the idea, and it will help them later on in life.

I think that you should lower the required Grade for sports because since most of the kids have a C average and that would make it easier for people to join the sports team of their choice. Imagine if everyone had C average, nobody would be able to join a sports team which would ruin the purpose of having one. It would help out everyone because nobody would complain about not being able to get on the team because they're one grade lower than required. It is ok if they play a sport as long as they aren't failing any of their classes.

What if you were in their shoes for a day. You could see how their classes are like and how difficult it is to get a B or an A. Some could be bad at a specific class but as long as they try their hardest and can get a C then they should be allowed to join any activity they want to. It can even aid students to get a better grade in their classes. Some of the activities could be a club that is for a certain class that can provide help so that the students can get a even better grade.

If there was a B required for an activity someone could be close to getting a B but they are struggling to learn in a class. If they could join a club that helps them they could get a grade better than a B and would better their learning experience. Some would also offer to tutor other students with a grade lower than a C and would want to join a activity or a sports team as well.

It is for the better of the students and can suite many students that want to learn better in some of their classes. It can also help students for their futures for collages and careers. Ex. Math club can help them prepare for future math classes that they will take. A sports team can provide practice for their career as a professional sports player. It really gives all the students an advantage to learn better and achieve their goals along the way. Their point of view on school or their teachers could change too. A student could hate a certain subject but if they learn it better they could start to understand the class and even the teacher more.

I believe that as long as a student has a C average they should be able to participate in all school activity's. Yes its true that when a student has a b average he/she will be more successful in life. If that student strives to his/her best they should be rewarded. I understand that failure is not acceptable, but in some cases that's not the students fault.

The student may not be comfortable in the class room. They may not understand yet, is scared to ask a question which may be able to help them in the long run. If a student is scared to ask a question there is clearly something wrong. If this is fixed their grade may be improve.

If you take away sports, clubs and, other activities away from them their not going to want to strive to get that B or C. All though C is not as good as an A it is not an failure. Tutoring is provided to help kids but, most teachers only offer it before and after school. If a student has no transportation then the tutoring does not help him/her. I strongly believe that if you allow kids to be their selves and, provide the help they need on the students terms instead of the adults, the grades will go up. The fearfulness and failure will go down.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I don't think you should do that because sports is what drives us to make good grades. and if u take that away we wont have anything else. Yes i understand you want to see better grades but for some kids its not that easy. They are either dxlicic or don't understand. i personally think if you give them a little tutoring that will make a great improvement. For examples staying after school and go in the morning. All they need is a little push. but hopefully you understand that we need sports. Without sports we don't have anything. Who knows we might take off and have excellent sports careers. Yes i know grades are important to but having problems about schoolwork is hard too. All we have to do is work hared and sports pushes us to do that. Like they say ""no pass no play"". Have you ever had something taking away from you and you felt like there's nothing else to work for? Well that's how we will feel if u take away sports. i promise you we will do better in our grades. Heck if they go to tutorials i will go to help them out. There is another thing teachers might teach their lessons in way a student might not understand but if another student helps out he might understand. And a c average is not that bad. when it becomes an f that's where can talk about it. But for now a c average is good. Its not great but it sure is good. And i know if we work even harder and come to tutorials we will do better. Hope you had a great time reading this letter and hope you have a great day!

1A58E2543D00,"I concur to not letting students participate in sports if their average is under a B. If they have below a B, their after school hours shouldn't be devoted to something that won't aid them educationally. Also, if a student has an average below B, it's possible that they aren't good at focusing, which would be a problem in any sort of sport. Above all of that, if a student cannot participate in a sport for having a below B average, it'll encourage them to bring their grade up so that they can participate in a sport.

Like I said at first, after school hours shouldn't be wasted on a sport if the student is doing poorly in school. That time could be spent studying for a test or completing homework, which the student would benefit from educationally. How many times have you heard the excuse of ""I had basketball/football/softball practice,"" for incomplete homework? Now the grade they get for the homework will lower their grade, but if they had been doing it instead of practicing, their grade would have likely gone up.

Sometimes, the reason a student's grade is low is because, try as they might, they simply do not comprehend the material. But in other cases, the student may be the type to become easily distracted, so they cannot focus when the material is being taught. If they were out on the football field or the soccer field and they were distracted, it could result in an injury of some sort. Therefore, a student should be able to focus well in order to be allowed to take part in any sort of sport.

Have you ever heard the saying, ""Wanting it is half the fun?"" This is quite true. If a student desperately wants to participate in a sport, yet they have a C average, what do you think they're going to do? They're going to endeavor to bring their average up to at least a B, naturally. If every student got their average up because they wanted to partake in a sport, that would reflect on the school as well as the teachers in a very positive way.

To conclude, I strongly believe that a student should have at least a B average in order to be in a sport. It shows that they're capable of both completing assignments and practicing for said sport. More importantly, if they're able to focus well in class, they'll certainly be able to focus well out on the field or the court, and that'll make them a more valuable player. Last but not least, because they'll want to be in the sport, many students will likely boost their grades in order to be able to do so, which, in turn, will boost the entire school's overall performance.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

They must earn their participation in any sports or any activities without a B average.

I think you are right about not letting kids without a B average participate in any sports or any activities . I work hard for the grade I get. If I work harder than most people ,how come we both get the same rewards . I think that because I work harder . Also because the better you are the better rewards you get.

My first reason is if I work harder than most of the students here then why do we get the same rewards ? I you were to work 92 hours and someone else worked only 24 , do you think you should get the same amount of money at the end of the week ? So I get an A or B yet someone else gets a D or C why would we get the same rewards ?

My last reason is if I am a behaved student with good grades while someone else is un behaved with bad grades why would we get the same treatment ? I get A' s or B ' s but someone else gets D' s why would we both be able to do something fun ? It wouldn't be fair .

That was my last reason .

So those were my reasons for why only good grade students should get rewarded and not graded students . Again they were : if I work harder than most why do we both get the same reward ? And if I'm good with good grades while someone else has bad grade while being bad they should not have the same treatment as me .",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
BFF95BC69F64,"To the Principle,

I strongly agree with your position on this new policy change. I believe it will benefit the students in many ways. For example, if a student wants to play a sport bad enough, he or she will want to strive for academic achievement to be able to play on his or her sports team. If the school was to just give out these privileges to any student who wants to play, they will stop putting in the hard work they need to learn in school, and they will be more focused on their sports teams. The outcome of this if we didn't have the new policy of a grade B average to play, would be that students would lag behind in school, possibly dropping their grade further. Secondly, if we go forth with this new policy change, it will boost the students confidence while playing sports. They will have a more positive outlook on school, their friends, family, and life in general. I believe this will happen because all the students playing sports will have a B grade average or higher, so they will not be depressed, like they would if they had C' s and below, and were rejected to be on the sports team. Another reason to consider making this policy change, would be the fact that it would increase the overall academic achievement on the school. There would be more B and A students, instead of C, D, and F students. So, when the MCAS testing comes around, we will be a lot more prepared then we would be without the policy change. Lastly, on events like field day, volunteer service, kids would be more willing to join, because they feel like they can make a difference in our community, on account of the higher morale and grades they will be receiving. Now, I believe there would be many consequences if we don't make this policy change. The big thing you and I can both agree on, is the fact that the students will lag behind in school, on account of their attention being put towards the thing they think is the most fun, which is sports. This will drop their grades. In the long term effect, it can affect the students MCAS scores. Can you imagine if the students in school playing sports kept getting of the habit of ignoring homework, quizzes, tests, and extra-curricular activities? It would be horrible! These bad habits could develop into something much more. It could continue into high school, even college! Even if we look at the present, right now. You said it yourself, most of the students are getting C' s. This policy change could someday change the lives of every student in this school, at the very minimum the ones who want to play sports. Also, like I stated before, if the school is rewarding the students with the privilege of being able to play a sport, when the students are getting C' s, they will become lazy. They will feel like they won't have to work for anything, and this could also affect the students life at home, which could in turn fire back at the school. By backfire, I mean lagging behind. If you haven't noticed a pattern yet, look at the facts. Without this policy change, everything leads back to depression, lower grades, and laziness. Also, one thing that no principle, staff, or teacher wants to see in a school, is drugs. In today's world, drugs use in teens is on the rise, and who are the kids that use them? The kids that get bad grades, who have lost the privilege to play on sports teams, and the kids who are depressed, and just don't care what happens to them anymore. So I ask you, please, we need to make this policy change. Look aside from the fact of grades and home life for a second. This could potentially save lives, drug abuse has killed teens with very bright futures in this world. In conclusion, I agree with you one hundred percent on this topic, and I hope that you make this new policy change.

This change is a bad idea. Students should be able to participate in after school activities with a C average for these reasons. A C is a passing grade, the rule is fine now so why should we change it?, and if you did change it more people wouldn't be able to participate in these activities.

A C is a passing grade. It may not be honoroll worthy, but it will get you through high school. It is one thing for a D not to be able to participate because it is not a passing grade, but a C should because it is a passing grade.

The rule is currently a C so why should we change it? It is also the way our parents did it, and they turned out just fine. Most of the people who are graduating have turned out fine too. Like that saying "" Don't fix it if its not broken"".

If you make the change then there wont be a lot of people participating because most people have a C average. For sports there wont be enough people to make teams, so our teams would have to forfeit. This would give the school a bad sports program, and a bad reputation about it.

As you can see there are many reasons not to make the change! Everything is good now so don't change it. Take the students advice and don't change it. Thank you!

I am an A/B honor roll student and I do play sports but I do happen to agree with this decision. Some people work really hard to try and stay in these sports they play. If your making a C average then that just shows that you aren't working hard to play the sports you have been working hard for. I see some people might get upset because sometimes it might be the ""Star Player"" making that C average. My friend made a failing grade and she didn't get to play and some of our teammates were upset including me because she was one of our best players but I do see that it was a fair decision, because other students push their limits to try and a make a passing grade.

If you really want to play your sports then you should be able to try to work hard and try to make at least a B average. Making a C average shows your coach and your teacher that you are not trying. So I do happen to agree with you about not letting the student play if they have a C average. Parents are upset sometimes because they push their children to work hard in that sport event, and to not see their star player out there, it's kind of devastating. You know you are making a good choice because sometimes when your really into the sport you're playing, you're not as fascinated as you are with your school work and other stuff that makes have a passing grade. You can't forget that school work is going to make you the ""big star"" you are going to become from playing those sports in high school and junior high. People do have their own opinions so I might be one of a few people that actually agree with you. I am not just saying that I agree with you because I have an A/B average in all my classes, but if it were to happen to me, not playing sports would help me catch up with my work that hasn't been finished. Many students would go against this policy change because they know that they make C averages in some of their classes. Other students go against this because they know that their ""star player"" is one of those students that don't care about their grades and only care about their future with sports. If they want a future with sports then they are going to want to put education before sports. I know a lot of students would agree with my reasons for agreeing with this policy change but they would not like it to happen. Our teachers tell them that having a C average is passing, but unfortunately that's not going to help them with the sports they play.

The ""star players"" will now if they are passing or failing because they know if they try with their school work. Many teachers offer help if you are having trouble with your work. So my Dear Principal I do agree that the student must have a B average to play the sports they want to be in.

5CFD0AB2D231,"I think that making students have a B average to be able to do sports or other after school activities would be a very bad idea. Mainly because many of my fellow students and I have a C average and some maybe lower. My friends and I love to do sports and we do work hard to keep our C averages. But if you take away our chance of doing sports that would be like taking away our motivation to keep learning and actually trying in school. Especially when we are in the eighth grade and our sports skills as well as our school skills are starting to really blossom. I also believe that when kids are in a sport or any after school activity end up doing much better in school.

Plus think of all the hard work students have put in to really getting the chance to play a sport or participate in an after school activity. Remember back when you were in school how hard it truly was to keep your grades up? Also think of the kids that need sports or activities to stay out of trouble or to have that extra motivation to keep their grades up. This is when students start realizing whether they really want to do this or not and some may possibly become famous at their sport or activity. But if you end up taking away that chance by changing the rules that would be crushing someone's hopes and dreams because of how hard they worked to keep their C averages.

Also I think our schools sport teams are small enough as it is, and by taking out those students with a C average we wouldn't even have girl sports and the boys would end up having the numbers that the girls used to have, which is barely enough. Plus think of all the other thinks they can do now but wouldn't be able to with the new rule.

I believe that you would just be trying to help but in reality all you would be doing is hurting us. Many kids also need sports to stay in shape. I think our country is overweight enough already and without kids being able to do sports they would easily gain weight. Also think of the students with troubles at home and do these after school activities to stay away from the drama at home for as long as possible, but would have to suffer through it even longer all because they have a C average. Is that something you really want hanging over you shoulders? I'm pretty sure I wouldn't be able to live with myself if I knew I was doing that to some poor innocent child. So I'm sure you wouldn't be able to either.

So i conclude that even if all you were doing was trying to help, your outcome didn't turn out that way. All you would be doing is taking away a kids hopes, dreams, and accomplishments. So please from my fellow students and I we ask you and strongly advise you with all the hope in our hearts that you will listen and DO NOT change the rules.

I think students who have less than a B average should be able to do sports, because doing sports teaches us students responsibility, and self discipline. It might not seem like it to you, but coming from a student who enjoys sports, I know how it makes most students act, and feel.

I think you should at least give the students a chance to show you that they would be able to get their grade up so they could play on teams and show their pride for their school. I know I enjoy getting out there, and just playing what I want to play. It motivates me to do my homework, study for tests, focus more in class. That seems to be one of the problems why you don't want students doing sports, because you want them to focus more on their work, well, I'm not sure that would be the best idea.

A lot of students find it irritating that they can't play because of their work, or grades, or something like that. And It makes them not want to do any other work. I'm sorry if this sounds rude, but I am just trying to let you know how the other students would probably feel about this. I just don't think it's fair that some students wouldn't be able to play because of a grade. Maybe if they had a failing grade then I would say no they shouldn't be able to play. But it's not a failing grade and you should give them the chance to show themselves that they can focus on their work, and still play the sport they love to play.

Yes, some students might not be as devoted as other students to get their work done, but definitely most students would think that if they can't play a sport then they better get their work done. It's just depends on the kid, but I know most of us teenagers would definitely try for that spot on the team if we just got the chance!

I agree with you that we should change the policy to maintaining a B average for being eligible for sports because, if someone has a C average they are just barely passing there classes. This could be a result in after school activities such as sports taking up to much time so that they cant do there homework and turn it in on time. Also a B average proves to not only the staff but to the parents of students participating in after school activities can maintain good grades while doing other things such as sports. Some students might find your reasoning a little bit harsh but, you know what they can deal with it because, if they don't maintain such grades other wise they will not continue on to the next grade with all there friends. Not only does this have a negative side but it also has a positive side. The positive side to this is that when they are not maintaining a B average is that they will have more time after school to finish there homework. Also they wont have to remember to pack there gear up and leaving something they need at practice. Instead they will be focusing more on there grades. so yes i do agree with your decision but, there is also a reason for me to disagree and that is that our students will not be getting there exercise in to keep them healthy. So if you do go threw with your decision than you should also increase the physical education to do more sporting activities and workouts.

I think that needing a B-average to be able to play in sports or other activities isn't fair. I think the minimum grade should be a C-average because a C is still passing and most schools have a policy that requires a C-avergae too.

I think it is a good idea to enforce a minimum grade average to be able to play but I think a C should be fair enough. If you change the policy to needing a minimum B-average then most kids wont be able play or join other activities. Kids earning a C should be able to play/join other sports or activities.

Also maybe before changing the policy, you might want to get opinions from parents and teachers. Getting opinions from these people is great because they know what we, the students, are capable of. Also when you change the policies you not only affect the students but you also affect the teachers, parents, clubs and sports teams.

In conclusion, you should really consider your options about how your going to change the policies because it affects everyone.

Why are you doing this to us? Many kids our age have many hopes and dreams of sometime in our life become athletes. We may not have the best grade ever but they could be one of the best athletes in the world who knows. A grade with a C average is not failing its just some students may need to have more attention in the teachers than others.

That's how important its.

I think that your idea for people who have at least a B average to be in activities is really not the greatest idea you could do for us. I will give three reasons for being against this idea.

I don't have a B average and am in band and I love it but if you take it away from me and my other band friends we will really be upset. I think that people should be in activities even if they don't have at least a B average. Everyone loves doing activities even if their grades are down, it makes school even more fun then it already is. If you take it away from us kids, we wont like school anymore.

People would go to school and look forward to the fun activities that are in place for them. I even know some people who are failing classes and do sports. I think you should do at least a C average or even a

D average for some students but don't ruin our school lives. When parents hear about this their children will be depressed and beg them to tell you to put activities back at school. Parents will help their child put their grade up but what happens if the student is struggling? Depression will hit them if that child does sports and doesn't get to play if they fail one single class.

Everyone doesn't like going to a boring school with no after school activities just because of their C average and all their other friends get all the fun. If you passed this I would get kicked out of band because of this. Don't so this to us students. Some of us are the best acting students and could be your best yet. You wouldn't be here without us.

I agree that students should have at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. Students will try to do better in school to be able to play a sport, Students will only play a sport if they really want to, and school's grade average will raise.

Many students love to play school sports and will try harder in school if it means that they can play. Many students do not put forth all their effort in school because they don't care. If a student needs to have a B average to be able to play sports many students will start completing all of their homework, start studying for tests, and just put more effort into school just so they can play the sport that they want to. Many students play sports and would do anything to continue to play the sport they love. Studies show that 2 out of 3 students play a sport and 1 out of 15 of those students has a B average or higher.

Students that aren't invested in their sport and don't care much about the sports they play will not try to raise their average but students who do will. That means that only students who are dedicated to sports and will put forth all of their effort for that sport will raise their average. That will give the sports teams more victories and make the school more proud of our teams. ""I would do anything to be able to play soccer."" comments one of the 8th grade students. This students' love for soccer will compel him to raise his grade to a B average or even higher.

Lastly, if all the students raise their average for school the school's academic ranking will also raise. That could be good for the school because parents will see that their children are getting a great education and they will be more likely to do more for the school like, volunteer, donate money, and supplies. Many schools are having money problems and donations could prove helpful for the district.

Students needing a B average to be able to participate in sports and other activities could prove helpful in many ways such as, students trying harder in school, more invested sport players , and the school's academic ranking will raise a sufficient amount.

Well what i think of this idea is that a ""C"" average is not bad it is well, average. why I think that is because some people get mostly ""C"" and ""B"". Also I think this would be a bad idea because getting a ""B"" in an advanced class will be hard and the student will end up dropping the class. Also having this will hurt the school reputation if smart people only play and they are not good, and this will also bring embarrassment to the coach. Also the student will think not to send the child to the same school, the old student will have bad memories or something of that nature. Also the student will not get liked if he missed an important game, and will become depressed, which will get his parents either involved or worried and he could end up with a psychiatrist.

So pretty much this could end up disastrous with the students, the parents, and just about a lot of things so if this happens the school would be horrible and everyone will hate it and there probably won't be more future students.

D37343CEA1EE,"To the principal.

I believe your possible policy change on sports participation standards is a good idea. I think students should have to get a B-average or higher, to participate in any sports activities. I believe this is a good idea because it will encourage students to achieve more, and work hard in school. Many students that are in sports activities are barely passing school with a C or lower, if you were to change the policy these students would want to raise their grades to stay in sports. While the students begin to work harder, the parents might pass word about how well this school works. More people may enrol students and spread the popularity of the school. With the schools new found popularity, and increase on students we may have more money for the school to use for, new books, better books and computers. Other schools may want to support our methods and expand the policy all across the city or state. In the process of all of this the student dropout rate may lower as well, because students will want to learn more. I support your policy 100%, but there could possibly be bad outcomes as well. Students may become furious and quit all sports, and possibly school in the future. The teachers may get annoyed with the amount of students trying to over achieve and quit, or punish the students. Parents enrolling more students may overcrowd the school and its property causing the state to shut it down. As you can see the good outcomes overcome the bad, and many of the bad come after the good. Please remember these are only idea, there is no promise that the change will cause the good or bad outcomes, but there is also no promise they will not happen either.

I personally don't think its a good idea that your considering changing school policy so that people may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

Sports has nothing no do with school, that's just another activity that's after school and the better you play sports the better your going to be good at school, specially with your grades. It keeps you organized and makes you stay on topic. For people sports are really important and really fun to play, it makes you runs and concentrated on how you play. You might think that for some reason that's why people are getting a bad grade average, but its not like that. I consider that sports are really important to me, and even if i don't play in a team i still love to play any kind of sport. It keeps me awake and motivated. It keeps me from stop being lazy all the time. There are 2 main reasons why i don't think its a good idea that you should change that policy. My first main reason is sports have nothing to do with school ,is just another amazing activity that people would enjoy instead of just watching TV or being on the computer. My second reason is like my mom always told me a story. When she was little and lived back in Mexico, she would tell me all about her childhood and what she would do at my age. She used to tell me that she would run every morning to exercise and breath the fresh air outside, after that she would be with my grandfather and helping him with everything that she could and then she would play Basketball with her friends. Having a little challenge to see who would win and just to have fun. I remember asking her if sports had to do anything with school? if that was an activity to bring my grades up ?' What she said Exactly was "" They invented sports so that kids, teenagers and people would have a routine and be a better person. Believe it or not mostly for teenagers, sports brings there grade up and well organized , and when i started playing sports, it did bring my grade up. What the captains do is that they show you how to be on time and do all your assignments so its similar to sports.''

I'll never forget the message that my mom gave me about sports.

F90BC2493C78,"Dear Principal TEACHER_NAME,

It has come to my attention that you are thinking of changing the policy of the sports and other extra-curricular activities. With your idea of having at least a B-average in order to participate, I feel that the school could have some major problems.

The first one is the sports teams. If a team's top player has a C+ average, even though they are so close they can't play. The team will suffer without that player. Teams are like families. Take one member away and the whole structure could fall apart. If you cut someone from a team just because of bad grades, they wouldn't be getting the experience in that sport that could help them later in life. Also, since a team is so close, removing one player could affect the entire way the team plays. A well built team has an understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses. If you remove a vital link, the team doesn't function like it should.

In sports, there are those few that are the best at their sport, but don't do well in school. They may have tried everything to improve their grades, but the grades don't change. By cutting them from the team, you are punishing them for something that may not be in their control. It would damage their self-esteem because since they can't do what they love, they are forced to do something that is torture to them.

Another reason to not change the cut is that clubs are a great way to make friends and learn new things. Like a sports team, clubs are like a family. You have all sorts of people with similar interests as you do. You can also make a lot of friends that you otherwise would have never met if it weren't for the club. Clubs can also teach you skills that you may have never learned, but may regret later not having. For example, I was once in a club that taught me how to work with electricity and other types of electronic devices. A few months later, I needed to help my dad with fixing a light fixture. Since I was in that club, I figured out that the reason the fixture didn't work was because the wires weren't connected correctly. If I didn't participate in that club, we would still be having issues with the lights.

Another benefit of being in a club is that you could find a hobby that you will do for the rest of your life. If a certain part of a club really interests you, you may go on to learn more about that subject and make it your hobby. That hobby could lead to a future career. If you cut kids with poor grades out of clubs, they may never learn about a hobby that could turn into a job that could help them prosper.

One way to compromise is to have a Homework Club for those who need a bit of extra help. They still get the benefits of being with people and making new friends, but at the same time they are learning better study skill that could help raise their grades.

By raising the cutoff for clubs and sports, you are depriving many of the students at this school of the ability to make friends, learn new things, and do well at what they do best. I want to thank you for taking the time to read my letter, and I hope that you will consider my points while you make the final decision.

AD6649397582,"Dear Principal,

I think that your decision is fair. Everyone knows that school comes first and activities come after. I do have a few arguments and suggestions on this subject though.

1) We do know that our school or even the bigger picture, America has a wide variety of people. Some people are at better in some subjects than others. Some may have a hard time focusing as well. Although we should all put forth our best effort, some of us just can't succeed in things. I don't think it is fair for these challenged people to be punished for trying there best. A better way to tackle the situation is to discover who these people are and compromise with them. You could ask their teachers if they show perseverance and respect. Everyone should respect their elders and if they don't they shouldn't be able to play school sports. The main point of this is, everyone has their strengths and weaknesses and to punish people for that is discouraging. Instead of allowing people to play on school sports teams based on their grades you should make the decision based on their respect and attitude towards school. If they take school seriously and respect their peers then they should be allowed to be active in sports.

2)Now there may be people that claim they are respectful and get descent grades but you know they don't. They might show that they want to participate in these activities very badly, but you'll have to stick with your decision. A good way of compromising however is to offer ideas to the student. These options for he or she will allow them to be on the team. Some options could be staying after school every day for the next 2 weeks to catch up on the work and write apology letters to the people they disrespect. They also could do community service for a set amount of time. Lastly they could help run errands for teachers including yourself. If they are willing to do these things too gain respect and be on a sports team then you should allow them to do so. If they fight back and say things like, ""That's unfair"" or ""No way!"" then don't put anymore thought into it and let them go. Although the meetings that you will have to have with these students may be plentiful, the outcome will be well worth it. The students will be more disaplent but also will have more fun. This is a great opportunity to fix the disrespectful students and allow school to be fun!

I think that if the policy change would be okay, Because it would be like a good idea.

Some students in sport or activities with a below a 50 or something shouldn't be participating in sports or activities.

So they can get a chance to finish or make the grade higher then the bad one so they can play or participate in any sports or events. When they get a higher grade they can play or participate in the events that the team is having. So students can make higher grades in class and be a smart kid. So they can have good collages and a good futures waiting for them.

But they can at least make a B on there test or semester or whatever. So they can play or be able to participate in any school events. They can make there life's a little bit happier. If they grow up they can get a lot of money and they will probably become famous because of this.

But it would be a good idea to this possible policy to change. and the students that have sports or that kind of nature in that particular are will probably hate that idea.

I think it wouldn't be fair for only people with a B average or above play sports. The reason I say this is because its hard to only have an A or a B for the whole school year. Its a hard thing to do, but it's not impossible. Sometimes playing sports help people get their grades up because the couch threats to sit that particular person on the bench. If someone really love the things that they do then they will try hard at what they do. I believe that it also goes along with sports. If you try to take sports away from failing student that might not do there work at all or possibly drop out of high school. On the other hand, they might start to make better grades so that they could get back on the team. This is a hard situation to go with because it depends on what type of student he or she is.

I do not think it would be fair to all of the football players, if you made it so that they would have to be a B average student to play. One reason why I think this is because without all of our good players, we would suffer badly. Also, it wouldn't be fair to other players. Lastly, these students wouldn't be allowed to play their favorite sport, and may resort to violence.

I think that if you made it so that every football player needed to have a B average, or better to play football our football team would do very bad. We need some of these players to play. Without them, we may lose our record of the most wins, or most championships won. Our other players like to have these players around because it gives them confidence when they are playing, and it sometimes inspires them to do better or practice more. These players can sometimes help people get active. Also, all of the other players would just get battered when they went to play the games. That is one reason why I think that you should not make it so that you had to have a B average or better to play football.

Another reason why I think this is a bad idea is because it wouldn't be fair to the other players. This sudden drop in players would make them have to pick up the pace. They may overwork themselves, and have something bad happen to them. Also, more players would have to play more than one position, and get stressed. Another scenario that might happen is that, all of the extra practicing may cause the normally B average students from doing their work, and their grades would also suffer. That is another reason why I think that the principle should not make it so that football players need to have a B average, or better, to play.

Lastly, I think that all students should be able to play football because, the players that can't play may resort to violence. These students may not be able to run off their stress, and take it out on someone else, or something else. Also, the students may become more disruptive in class, which could lead to an expulsion, or two, which would not look good for the school. The player who couldn't play may also do something criminal to take out his anger, and end up in jail. As you can tell, it would be very good it you don't change the rules about who can play football.

In conclusion, I don't think that the principal should change the rules on who should/shouldn't play football. One reason why I think this is because, our team's record would suffer. Also, it wouldn't be fair to the other players. Lastly, the students may resort to violence.

Please principal, do not make it this way, let everyone who wants to play football be able to play, no matter what their grade is. The whole school district would like it if you kept the old rules up, and not make any new ones.",5,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
D99A7BF56928,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I respect you, but every kid in this building loves having sports. We love the idea and action of smiling while having a good exercise with our friends. We naturally crave fun activities while in school because it gives us a break from sitting down, taking notes, and doing work for a period of time in the school day. Also, our guardians, teachers and peers advise us that being active for an hour a day is good for us. Even though one period is not an hour, 45 minutes of activity and exercise is quiet close, nonetheless. I have a theory that if people, especially teenagers, aren't active they won't live as long or healthy life as people who are active. This is because exercising leads to good health. Everyone wants or has that so that leads to a healthy lifestyle. A healthier lifestyle often leads to a longer life all together.

Also, if an average number of the students have a C average and the requirement is a B average, then the majority of kids won't be active. What will they do, watch a handful, maybe not even, of people have fun and be active? If kids know that they aren't going to be active, have fun, or do anything a whole period then more kids will cut class and with that comes a higher risk of violence or in appropriate actions in school. If majority of kids will do work as others don't then it could get confusing, whose playing and whose not. Some kids would probably lie and say they have a B average when they don't.

Even after all of this, if you don't completely agree with me, I have a compromise in mind. There won't be only a handful of kids playing if you just have the expectation to a C average at the least. In these type of situations, I think majority rules and the majority in this case is a C average oppose to a B average. It sure will have a lot less problems and a lot more exceptions as well as smiles.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I think this change in policy is unneeded for many reasons and I hope that this letter will help you come to my understanding. Many students at this school participate in sports and some of them are not very good at school work but they at least have a passing grade. Some students have a lot on their hands not only at school, but at home as well. If you make this policy official then it will put more stress on students to keep up with their grades more than ever, and if they have more stress on them they will perform poorly at tournaments and meets. Some may not be able to even compete because they are at home trying to do work to keep a b average.

I can see why you would want to keep students grades up and keep the student body as smart and hard working as possible, but some students can't handle that kind of pressure added on to what they've already got going on.

I would like to say my opinion about participating in sports or other activities is that you should have to maintain atleast a B in every subject. Before you participate in sports or other activities school always comes first, which is most important to focus more on than joining sports or other activities without doing work. If students know that school work is always their number one priority than they should know that it is most important for them to get good grades. In qualifying sports it should be required to maintain a B in every subject.

I think this because if student who participate in sports get good grades since sports in very important to them then most likely the students would want to atleast do their work and to try their best knowing that they do care for their grade since they are in sports.

Student who also join sports and will maintain atleast a grade of a B in every subject will not really have to worry since they know that they are already doing good with all of their school work. The better grades they get in school shows that they do pay attention in class instead where students don't pay attention or don't do their work and getting a bad grade. The student would need to atleast give up sports and try to do all of his/her work first to get better grade, so that the student can continue to do sports again.

Thank you for all your understanding! I really do appreciate it a lot because students grades are very important to the department of education, parents of the students, and what they are learning in school is always the students number one priority before participating in any other sports or activities.

I think this idea will encourage students to do better in their subjects because in all my years of being a student i have notice many students always excited saying please bell ring now but i was confused i didn't know why he wanted the bell to ring so badly so i check my schedule and i notice that it said gym 4th and 5th period and that's when i understand why he was so excited to leave.

The school grade average can get higher if you change the average to B because many kids want to play sports or do other activities and having a good school average will help the school passes levy and even more parents will support the school.

7BCA4D717649,"Dear Ms. Principal,

I strongly disagree with your policy. Every student, no matter your grade average, should be able to participate in after-school activities. It's not fair to those who do better in sports then academics! Maybe if the policy was changed into something else, like if you're late to class for a number of times, then you don't get to participate in activities. But grades are not a good place to judge a student. And you, being the principal, should know what the kids in this school are getting. Many of them of getting a C average. It's not fair to half the school not let them join the clubs or activities. So in my opinion, I disagree with the policy.

Maybe you can use this policy as a punishment to those who don't follow school rules. Like if a student is late to class every day, their activities and sports privilege is taken away until he/she is no longer late on a daily basis. Another time where this policy can act as a punishment is if the student gets detention a number of times. Then their privilege is also taken away. Instead of not allowing the students with bad grades to participate in these activities, make the students that are bad and needs to disciplined to take the punishment. Then this is much more fair to those with below a grade B average.

Students deserve to join these fun activities and the sports of their choice. This is what most students look forward to on days where they have extracurricular activities. It'll be such a shame to take that away from a student just because of their grades. It' not fair to them. Sometimes, grades are purely the teacher's choice. Like the amount of extra credit you deserve, or the points taken off on your project, this is your teacher's choice, not the student's. If the student did a 100 point project and the teacher took off ten points because he/she thought it wasn't neat enough, it's the teacher's choice. So taking away the fun activities is not fair to those whose teacher are strict with points.

There is one thing in your policy that I agree with though. Students who average a D or an F in their report cards for more then two quarters need to have words spoken to. To those students who average a D or F will get consequences. The consequences may include taking away their extracurricular privileges. Until they get at least a +D or C on their report card, they can't participate in the sports or activities. I, as a student, understand that students can't always control their grades. But when their grades are so low that get a F, something is definitely wrong. This is the time to not let them

There could still be a policy on activities and sports, but it can't be on because the student's grades, unless their grades are so low, something has to be done. Otherwise, this policy should only take place on students who are naughty and ought to be taught. Since this policy has not yet taken action, maybe you can change it to something more reasonable. Not to be questioning your power, Ms. Principal, but it'll be much more fair to those with ok bad grades to those who really deserve to be taught a lesson or two. Because there's too many kids out there in this school who gets a C average, it'll be better this way. In my opinion.

I firmly believe that students must have a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities. there really isn't any way to elaborate on this issue, because it is simply an easy argument to be made. Students are supposed to come to school to be educated not to play basketball. So, shouldn't their education be the main focus of their schooling? Some may argue that it is not fair to the students that have learning disabilities, who already have a hard time maintaining a C average as it is. However, it is the job of the public schooling to provide them with the help they need in order to succeed. If we don't, then it comes down to the government not doing their jobs. But, I hope this is not the case.

So in all, if we let the school's star soccer player slide with a C average, what kind of examples are we setting to each other or the next generation? We need to challenge our students to strive to their fullest extent. Not to what they want to do, but what they need to learn and know.

I am awake 15 hours a day and more than have of that time is at school, and, while I go to school it takes up more time that I would have to study but instead of being able to study I have to learn more things.

If the students have to get a b average but aren't able to it will stop them from doing something they love. Students could try to make time to study but it could be very hard too.

I have brought to your attention some really good reasons that would regret you ever coming up with the idea of students not joining sports with averages under B.

The first reason would be that some students are really gifted and talented at the sports our school has to offer. And to let you know, our school hasn't even won a single trophy ever. So I advise these gifted and talented students to join the sports programs at the school to bring honor and glory to this establishment. Plus, if you don't let them join, you're going to be swamped with parents complaining why you didn't let their son or daughter join a sport at school because of their grade. I know your trying to keep kids from failing and all, but they should do something other than studying or working to get their mind off of some things. This may help them release the tension of studying and work to do something that they absolutely love to do.

The second reason would be that some students get really bored and I know you do to. Some of the students here at school get really bored because theirs no action going on or their is nothing else to do because their always doing work. If they want to join a sport, you should let them join as long as they promise to keep their grade up. Then they wouldn't be so bored all the time. Let me tell you something. On average, kids or teenagers who don't involve themselves in sports don't make friends because they were never around a crowd of people or a big group of kids. They eventually end up doing stupid things and some of those things, they never end up recovering from.

The last and final reason would be that some of the kids would end up failing on purpose and make the school look bad, including you. Some kids like that are very persuasive and usually end up getting what they want and then they get back on track and do better now that they have something to do. Plus the number of kids also get their grades low to get suspended and to make the school look even worse. Those kids end up getting their grades up and joining a sport that they've wanted to join ever since they started school.

So on the terms of parents, bored ness, and looking bad, I would advise to take this rule or soon to be rule",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I have heard about the new academic rule, requiring a B average to play a school sport. For many kids a B average is tough to come up with especially for those are involved in other activities outside of school. You must realize that we are kids and coming up with a B average with all the homework and tests and quizzes that our teachers give is are really hard to complete, along with other extra-curricular activities and other athletics we are associated with.

Being part of an athletic team means a lot to a kid like me. Being able to participate in our interests and the things we enjoy and love to do is just wonderful. If you are going to take that away from many kids, then a lot of kids may proceed to do even worse. That is definitely not what you want. I think that the C average was fine the way it was and is a good academic goal for some of us.

I think many other kids would be able to come up with a B average if you told your teachers to cut down on the homework and quizzes somewhat. Being part of other athletic team and social groups does not give me much time to do my homework. Kids should be able to experience the 'right kind of childhood' and with all this homework and tests, I am staying up until at least eleven o' clock every night trying to complete my homework or studying for a test. To me, eleven o'clock on a school night is way to late, which is leaving me tired every day and not being able to perform to my full potential.

You might say that school is more important than anything else and that if we do not have enough time to do our homework, that we should just quit, or stop attending those extra activities. Quitting those other activities would leave our middle school careers with nothing but homework and studying. Doing homework and studying all day long will bore your students and eventually most of us will stop completing our tasks assigned. As kids, free time is very valuable to us. Participating in other activities makes us well-rounded students and most importantly 'who we are'.

Lastly, I think this rule is a little to strict. I think this because not only are we assigned a great amount of work, some of us are learning harder criteria than others and that is definitely not fair. Overall, I believe what we are given is tough and a challenge to complete. Those are only a few reason why I believe you should re-think about that rule change. I hope you put great thought into even possibly changing this rule back to the way it was and in my mind should be. Thank you.

I'm against making students have at least a B average in all classes to keep their spot in school activities. Most students have a C average during the school year. Parents would agree with me that if they have at least a B and it drops and the students are working very hard then they should still be allowed to participate in sports and other school activities. If a student is working hard in sports and focus on that for a career or their future then they wouldn't need to have a B average to keep that dream.

Many Students stay around a B average for the year and if the school makes them have a B or above most of them wouldn't be able to play sports or do other activities. Some students are very smart and would maybe stay on the team if they have a B average. Students shouldn't feel left out if their not smart and are good in other things. There are a lot of students that are athletic but not school smart.

Parents would agree with me that if they have at least a B and it drops and the students are working very hard then they should still be allowed to participate in sports and other school activities. Students may work very hard to succeed in school work but many just focus on other things as sports or other activities, so they might not have a B average. If they have just one class they can't keep a B average in than that's not fair to them, they may just have trouble concentrating in that class or need extra practice but that's no reason to not let them play in sports or be in activities.

If a student is working hard in sports and focus on that for a career or their future then they wouldn't need to have a B average in school. Many students now days want an athletic career or something their good at. If a student doesn't want out be something that has something to do with work then they shouldn't have to keep their grades up. There's many students that have big dreams of becoming famous or something like that but some students need to have school and have a B or higher to do many things.

4605F8B93BFF,"I do not participate in the sports and not very many activities so this does not really affect me. But this is still not very fair because the students grades are C's. The students do like the sports and activities but it is too hard for them to reach grades above a C. The students should be able to decide whether they need C's or B's and they will most likely choose C's.

This change could help bring the students grades up but it also might not. If the change were to happen there is a 50% chance that the students will try to get B's. But there is a chance the students wont even try to get the B's. The students might decide to not even try to get grades unless the policy stays at the C grade average.

The students will dislike the new policy very much so it is a good idea not to change it. If a majority of the students that try out for the sports, and the students that enter the activities already have B's then i would say go ahead and change the policy. but if a majority has C's the i would keep it the same.

You, the principal, should try out the new policy for a month and if grades start going up to B's for the sports and activities keep the new policy, but if grades don't go up or they start going down change it back to the original policy. There should be a vote for the new policy and on the ballot the choices should be ""try the new policy for a month"" ""make the new policy perminent"" or ""not have the policy""",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

Many students in this school try their best in to get the best grade possible, but there is something they cant put attention to which causes them to have C grade averages. It's not fair that students with a C cant participate in school sport or activity. what could happen is the school would have more tutoring. maybe, the class assignment should be more understandable for the students. Lastly, the school should have a different grade process. I will not let the students at this school be bored and lifeless after school just because they have a C.

Students should be allowed to join a school sport or activity just because thy have a C. I think the school should have more touring. tutoring helps many people that don't understand a subject much. With tutoring, students at the school will have better grades, and lots of them will be happy because there in a activity or sport that they like. This is why students with C' s should be allowed to play in school sports or activities.

7301B174090E,"I believe that a B average would be a good thing to bring into sports. why i think this would be good is because for the kids who love to play sports it will give them a harder drive to make good grades and do good in school. Then again some of the teams best players may not be able to make a B average. this will make teams much small and sports not near as exciting or fun for the spectators who watch these games. very many parents my not be happy about their child not being able to play on a team, but school should be more important to these parents who's kids are not achieving a B average.

The main reason why i think students should have to have a B average before being able to play sports is that school is the most important thing in someone's life. Even if some kids are not making that B if they love e the sport they play enough they will make that b average no matter what. This will make students strive harder in school but also in sports because they know that they are right on the edge of a C average that will also make the strive harder in whatever sport you may play.

On the other hand their will be many mad students and parents because that student is not able to play the sport that he or she may love. and also the coaches may get mad too because one of his or her best plays may not be making the grades that he or she needs to make to play this sport. This would probably only happen for a couple of years or sport seasons but after awhile everything would be back to normal and it would be just like anything else in the world and people would begin to grow to the B average rule that the principle has.

I think in the end that this would be a good thing because it would make students want to try harder in school if they really like a sport and wanted to bring their grade up to be able to play this sport. Then again i think every school should have to have this rule because it would be unfair to one team if the other team did not have the players they wanted because of this rule. I think you could take this rule and put it into school systems and see improvement all over the state then maybe all over the country. So yes i think that even though it would cause a lot of trouble it would be a good thing to raise grades all over the country.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
E3BA4F414829,"Dear Principal,

The students of our school think that this policy is not fair. We think that we should have a D or F average to stop participating in school sports and other activities. We, the students, agree that if because of certain reasons grades are slipping, we will work to keep our grades up to continue with the sport or activity we participate in . If our grades are a B- and up we will continue to keep our grades up and be good students. Students with a C average will continue to work hard, study, and make better grades instead of taking the risk of letting grades slip.

Certain sports may be hard to work school around. For example football is a very important sport at our school and the players work hard at practice, they will continue to work around practice and get all their study time in to make the grades and stay on the team. Your policy will continue to make the students work harder but it is to fair to many. Some may have a C average but they may be working as hard as the others who have an A average. Some may not be able to understand the curriculum. This will change the student body drastically.

In conclusion the policy of only allowing students with a

B average join sports and other activities will not allow students to play certain sports and participate in clubs and other activities that they are interested in. We will be glad if you would continue with the current policy. We would hope that this helped you view our opinion on this topic.

2FDE1544FD26,"The principle has a lot of choices to make in a day. If she does decide to higher the grade requirement then more of the athletic kids will try harder in school.

The principle may have many choices to make in a day although sports should not be one of them. She could take away all of the sports if she wanted to. If she decides to higher the grade requirement then it would be one less worry on her mind.

So she can focus on the students getting better grades in the school. She will have less punishment to worry about that goes on in the classrooms. The students would have to work harder to get what they want and they would try harder in the sport activity.

The principle can also be more strict with the rules of the sports she can make it to where if you get suspended then you can not play for the rest of the season. She can make it to where if you give your teachers a hard time you can not play the sports. If the students are causing to much trouble in the classrooms then she can take away the sports all together.

She may have the power to take away the sports but if she does that then the grades in the school may drop. If she does decide to take away the sports then the kids that were trying hard to keep a good grade for the sports then they would stop trying so hard to keep them. If she just was to higher the grade then the kids that were already getting the good grades would be able to play without feeling left out of the team.

I strongly believe that students should get to have a C average to work in sports or other activities. Without this opportunity, many children will lack in physical. With a B average, many students may not keep up to that level, which overtime, makes them grow weaker. Not having activities and sports will hurt people physically, but also mentally. It can cause more stress to student's minds.

Students should get as much physical activity as they want, but if they have to have a B average, then this will make them get worse at what they may do best. These people should be getting enough freedom to do an activity for at least a C average. They will lack in physical skills and it may even mess up peoples dreams. If you know most of your students maintain at a C average, then leave them like that. Of course, changing the policy might make them work harder, but its just not fair.

Students may see a positive change in there grade average, but if someone likes to play a sport, then there shouldn't be a change in policy. There will be a positive side, but also a negative side to it. Students will get weaker without working in sports, or may even be much more lonely. In a young persons life, they don't want to be lonely. They want to be more social and talk with friends, participate in an activity. All these things help students grow up more healthier in life.

Some students may think its easy, but for most, it is hard. Since most of your students have a C average, then there is some bad effects on changing it to a B average. One important thing is stress. Every student wants to go to school stress free and going to special activities is a huge help in that. If people have to maintain a B average, it can add stress, because they are so caught up into trying so hard to maintain a B average. Stress at a young age may cause students to have a more lonely life. They may not have a social life and be sad most of the time.

As you see, principle, it is a much better idea to keep the policy the same. Students will lack physical education, it will have a bad negative affect, and it causes more stress to students, if sports and activities are only open to B average students. People will not like this new idea because they used to have so much of a good time, but with this, it could possibly change their life a lot.

D0AAEE68941A,"Dear principal well i do not think that this is fair because some students cannot get that much of a high grade as other students. So i think that this idea is a waste of time because there would not be that much people joining the sports and other activities because as i said before that not everyone can get a average grade of B and higher. Even now since most kids are struggling about school now a days. So i am against this argument and i think that they should not do this because as i had said before not everyone will be able to a tend these activities. So if you ask me not everyone is able to get a grade B average. And what if the student is mentally challenged then it would be even harder to get up to a B average grade.

This is why i do not support this idea on having the grade a B average to a tend sports and other activities. Even though doing this may give kids now a days to get that extra boost to try and get higher grades. It also may not give kids the boost as well. You see kids who have low self esteem will just give up because they do not think that they will be able to make it up to a B average to a tend sports and other activities.

This is why i do not support this idea that the principal is doing because as i had said before in the first paragraph and second that not everybody will have the chance to a tend these activities because of the struggle some students are having in school.

You said that the students couldn't participate in sports unless they have a

That with sports and keeping a B average, that's a lot of work for one person. And on top of that the sports practise after school then school projects. Students will not have time to keep a B average because all the work they have to do. So for every kid and parent that wants to participate in sports, please change this school policy back, it would be a lot easier to the parents to because they work and have to clean all the time they don't have time to do all that.

Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME. I attend you school SCHOOL_NAME.

I am writing this letter to aware you of the changes you have made in the school policy. I see that you have made a change that no students are allowed to play sports unless they have a average of a B , which I think is a great policy mentally. Because I think students have a high C they should still be able to participate in school actives because no kid wants to sit out.

I think that if students have a average of high C they should still be able to participate & also because students that have one C can be slacking off only in one class and I think that's acceptable. Not everyone does great in every class / subject. Also if students are really great at that sport we can be able to reward them with a scholarship. Like me I am a good student I have good grades the only class that I don't really great in is mathematics. I get a high which I think is acceptable.

This new policy I may think is also regarding many parents of the children in the School. Some parents probably may go along with this rule. Yes because it is a good rule I think this policy is good but should also be to student with a high C average . Why? Because if students have a high C they are closely high to B which in that matter are eligible to participate in the school major activities. I say ""Major Activities"" because I think it should only be sports that are eligible for scholarships like for boys/girls Basketball, Baseball, Soccer , Track , Football and Cheer leading.

Even if this a rule because the school board doesn't want to loose a lot of money which I would understand . But there is ways for a school to make money like having a fundraiser and also for the sports students can also go tagging like at the nearest food store . Ex. Shop rite,

Path mark, Stop n Shop etc. And get money for new outfits for the type of sport they are playing.

Changing school policy so students with c grades that need b grades are not able to play a school sport is a bad idea.

Some kids may have a problem with math or science or social studies or English that doesn't mean you shouldn't stop them from sports.

Its a good way of exercise and they could go on to be great players.

They are atleast trying their hardest to get their work done and get the highest grade they can get but it can be hard for them.

If a student is smart and you know it and they aren't try to the best of their abilities i could se why you would do that.

I myself am like that, but atleast a c is passing and you would like to see someone succeed wouldn't you? I know i would that would make me very happy.

A sport to me is like my life my life revolves around sports and exercise with friends.

I'm not always available out of school so i use the school activities and sports to hang out with my friends and stay active. If you take sports away from a kid who is very fit but doesn't do good in school they could become slackers and give up in live and not be as fit as they were before.

I believe that changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is a bad decision. If the school policy was changed there would not be many students participating in sports or other activities. Many students have a grade C average which would inconvenient them from participating in school sports and/or activities.

Not many students who have a grade B average are athletic to participate in sports but would enjoy participating in school activities such as clubs. But if there are not enough students to participate in school sports it would just be a waste of money to purchase equipment for those sports. Many students who play sports have a grade C average and are very athletic students. It would also be unfortunate for students who do play sports to not be able to participate if they have a grade C average. If those students do not participate they would probably not participate in school activities that they do not enjoy.

Changing school policy is also a bad idea because many students rely on athletic scholarships to get into college since not all families are lucky enough to send their children to college without having to worry about have financial problems doing so. But since the prices for college tuition is going up not many students have enough money to attend college right after high school. Many of those students also have a grade C average. Also many students who are very good at sports but not very academically skilled may see that sports are what help them get by in life. Those students also find it very difficult to get into a good college they can afford if they have a grade C average but do not have a chance to get into a college if they cannot get a scholarship for athleticism.

So I hope you reconsider of changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average because not many students do. Those students may also rely on baseball or football scholarships to get into college if they cannot afford it on their own.

I have just been informed that you have been thinking about changing our school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I understand your concern about us student averages and educations , but I think that it would be a little harsh if you were to change the rules because some students really do try their best, and still end up with an C average. I personally think that you should change the rule to that if you have a C average and missing work in that class then you shouldn't be able to participate in sports or any other after school activities. But if you have a C average and no missing work then your able to participate in after school activities.

The reason I think it should be done this way is because some students turn in all their work and still end up getting a C, because they got a bad grade on a test or something. I'll admit that most students do play around and do not turn in work, but end up getting lucky on a test or something along those lines, and still pull out a C average in that class. That in which them should not be rewarded.

I also do understand your concern about some students not understanding the material that is being taught to them. if that is to be the case them the student's that are having trouble or need a little help, they should come to an adult. They should not just sit in class and pretend they understand what they are learning and end up at the end of the year failing because the did not have the courage to ask for help. But that would not be all the students fault. Our teachers should be more open and inviting to the students. I'm not saying the teachers should become friends with the students, I just think that the teachers should be come friend with the students. The students should just be comfortable enough to open up to the teachers with out rejection.

So in conclusion I think that the rules should be changed but not to where we students have to have a B average to participate in after school activities. The rule should be changed to where if you have a C average but no missing work you can participate. But if you do have missing work in the class that you have a C average in then you can not participate, because that shows that did not do your personal best in that class. This is why the rule should not be change to where you have to have a B average to participate in after school activities.

Grades are very important because they measure l I think that students who do not have a B average or higher should be given a chance to improve their grade and seek help with subjects they have trouble with. If they fail to do so then they should not be allowed to participate in sports because the students should be spending most or all of their time studying and improving their learning.

Once the students improve their learning, it will be shown by their improved grade and only then should they be allowed to rejoin their sport or activity.

Also the threat of losing the privilege of participating in the activity or the need to become eligible to be in that activity again should inspire motivation for the children to work harder to earn better grades as well as inspiring their teammates to encourage them which promotes teamwork. This also helps the sports and activity teams themselves because only the kids who are really passionate about the sport will try to improve their grades and those who do not care about their teams will be less likely to stay on or be admitted back into their respective teams.

The requirement of a B average to participate in a sport also encourages a more balanced life style which is very healthy for the students. Having a balanced life style is essential for the students to be successful later in life and we should do as much as we can to encourage it.

The new policy, to me is not a very good Idea. One many students work at an average level. This would cause these student who do not work at the level as others, not be able to play sports or attend other after-school activities. This in my case is not fair to those students on many levels.

For starters, if most students have a C, many of them will not be able to play. Some are capable if pulling their grades up. But on the other hand others may be doing their best to keep a C. It would be more legitimate for the policy is, If you are passing your classes you should be able to be in after-school activities.

Also, for the people who are already at a B average, they might think they do not have to try as hard as the others and their grades may slacken due to this. Then they will also be restricted from these activities as well. Therefore disabling many more students to be illegible to play, this also causes stress. Which is not very good for young students as us, then could also cause us to even worse than we already are.

After all, students try harder to keep their grades up when they are doing these activities, without them students tend to slack off cause their will be no punishments for not doing them. These activities teach responsibility for students to work hard and continue to do it with striving success

To conclude, This is what most students need to relive stress. Without these activities it stops kids from developing skills that might have been needed. Also teaches a great deal of responsibility for a student to learn, which is needed for I future life. We can really benefit from these and extending the standards are not helping that much.

I support your idea that students should have atleast a C average in order to join after school sports and clubs. My reason for this is that I think by having a reward for getting passing grades students would try harder to do well in school. Secondly I also think it would help teams to do better at a sport since they would have people on the team who would be dedicated to what they are doing since they worked so hard to get on there. Also students will help their friends do better in school if they can both join the same club or sport. This would teach students how to study and be responsible. Most importantly this would give extra curricular activities some meaning since students will be interested in what they joined and will try hard to achieve everything thing can in it.

Thank you for you're time,

There are pros and cons for this situation. One example of a pro would be that student would work a lot harder.

A con would be that your sports teams and activities could start to do really bad because of the shortage of student participation.

The good part of the rule change is that it will push students to do their best.

It could also help the get better grades and not mess around during class. If they seriously want to play sports then they will work hard to do it.

Students are supposed to be student-athletes.

The term student-athlete means that you are a student before an athlete.

If you don't have the grades to play than you are ineligible .

You have to work hard to play hard and if you cant do it than you need to work harder or seek help from a teacher.

The bad part of the rule change is that your activities and sports teams could start to decrease in size.

It would not be a good situation if your school was known for your sports teams.

I think it is fair to make the B average rule for sports but not for activities. It would be very unfair.

Anyone should be able to join clubs and activities.

I think it is a bad idea to make students have a b average or higher in order to participate in sports teams. many students don't make those kind of grades and not only would there be fewer students capable of making those kind of grades but there would also be less students that are eligible to make a sport team and therefore we would have a smaller team and we may also become inferior to other schools with sports, thus we lose to other teams do to a lack of team size(the way I see it if we go along with that idea not many students will be able to make the team and a team cant operate well when it only consists of few people and we would be outnumbered by the average sized sports team).many students will strive to be on a sports team but when you make them have an average grade of a b then some will give up and go home telling themselves that they are not capable of being put on the team and that they should forget about it and then they will have no motivation at all to do good anyhow. if you make students at least have a 2.0 GPA(which is the required GPA to be eligible to play and participate in sports and sporting events)then students will actually have motivation to do good and wont think that the required grades are impossible(where as if we were to make students have an average grade of a b many students would be discouraged and tell themselves that they are not capable of making that kind of grade and will just give up on making good grades whatsoever or even make a sports team for that matter)its good to make grade requirements to be eligible for a sports team but if you push the students to high with the average grade of a b then many students with their mentality will just give up and will think they aren't capable of making the right grades why I think that we should have an average grade of like a 2.5 to be eligible for sports

I believe that the idea of not allowing students to participate in sports if they have lower grades is a good idea, however I believe that the required grade should be lower than a B.

Perhaps instead of having a B average students should be required to have a C average.

My reasoning behind this is that while a C is considered a bad grade it is not absolutely terrible.

A C grade is still a decent grade, although while not particularly good, and should still be acceptable.

Also you have to take into consideration that a majority of our schools students are averaging a C, which is below the proposed requirement level for sports and other recreational activities.

If this proposed policy is put in place it will severely hurt our athletic and extracurricular activities and what would the community think if suddenly more than half of our basketball, football, and choir dropped out?

And I don't even want to begin to think of how many angry phone calls we will get once the parents find out about this policy.

I believe that this is a good idea to motivate our students to do better in school, but also think that the required grade average is to high.

Like I stated earlier perhaps should consider making the proposed average a C.

This would still motivate kids to do better in school, as most of them are currently maintaining a C average and must watch their grade to make sure it doesn't drop below that.

Please consider my ideas and the ideas of my peers carefully before making your decision.

Principal (last name),

With all do respect I am against your idea of not letting kids play sports if they are not on a B average. I don't think it's fair because a B average means ""good"". A C average is average. If a student has an average letter grade they should still be able to play or participate in sports. My reason is a student could easily fail in a class if they didn't care. But, if a student has a C average letter grade then it means that the student is showing that him or her is at least having to show some effort. Rather It's doing homework, doing good on test/quizzes, or even getting a decent grade on in-class work.

When you take away sports from students, you are taking away some students time to be active and express themselves. Also when you take away sports you could be taking away a students social time with peers. I am asking you to please reconsider your rule of letting students play sports unless they have a B average grade. Thank you for your time to read this letter

I greatly disagree with you. Many students struggle with keeping a C average and it is considering a passing grade so why not let them ''pass'' on by and play sports. This also has upset many parents as for their kids are athletes but cant play for this reason. Many schools around let their kids participate in school sports with a c average. This can also affect our athletics and how we perform their for some kids will not be able to participate. This also can affect how many students attend this school for the new rule. So it looks like the odds are stacking up against this despicable new rule. And its my opinion that this new rule is very unlikely to pass with the B.O.E. I think they will veto the rule as if they see all the odds against this new rule. I honestly really dislike this rule and so does many other people. Also some of the other activities can be helpful to us as in community service. So this rule can harm the school in many ways; as in sports, community service hours, participation and etc. that is why i disagree with you on this new rule as well as many other students and people do as well.

Changing the grade point to a B would mean that less people will be playing sports. You could have your best QB in football but you would have him playing because he is a C+ average student at School. Then your team would probably not be good at all. You wouldn't have a good team for any sport. The students would be constantly getting harassed by their parents. And they would have nothing to do on the weekends. Plus the attitude of the Students would change and the principal and teachers wouldn't get any respect at all. There might end up being more people in ISS or some with Detention because of their Attitudes. The pep rally's would be ruined. A lot of the students that play sports are the ones that have the C-, C+, or even just straight C's. Some have B's and A's but there wouldn't be enough talent on the teams in any sport for the school. The thing that matter's the most on the football and basket ball teams and any other team would be their talents. Many schools have the talent but some of them are not the brightest people. But some are just smart enough to still play the sport they love.

The schools need to leave the grade point to a B because what other extra activities are the football and basket ball players going to do after school? Science Lab, Writing Stories for school, News Paper. No, their not because they because it's not what they love. They probably hate everything else or mostly everything else because they play the sports. They get the Fans fired up and gets the school spirit going. But that will be all gone if the principle raises the grade point. No one is going to get rallied up if they don't have any of the cool popular kids that everyone is friends with on the other team. It would not be the same. Not like it would be through the past. Also that it has been the same for many years. What's the point of changing it now. It would be pointless.

I think that you shouldn't make it to where only students with a B or higher could go into sports or after school activities because some of these students depend on sports or other activities. First some students want to do sports to get their mind off of big tests or other projects they need to do, some students want to get more active to loose weight and finally some students just need time away from their family. Most of these students have C' s but they want to go into sports but cant if you make it only to where there grades can only be A' s and B' s.

First off, why I think it should stay the same is because some students want to do sports to get their mind off of tests or big projects coming up. When you join a sport then all you think about is the game that you are going to attend. You will have your mind set on what place you are going to come in and you aren't thinking about all of those big tests or projects that are coming up or that are due. It is said that if you go to sports then you will have a higher metabolism to loose more weight quicker.

Secondly, I think that you shouldn't change it because some kids want to loose weight. Most kids cant get out of the house and exercise so they turn to sports. They want to loose weight to be more thin so they have fun with their friends in a sport that they are mostly interested in. People like to do things with their friends so they can ask their friend if they want to join the same sport/ activity with them. Parents will really love the program and encourage their child to join so we have a bigger team.

Finally, why I think that it should stay the same is because kids don't want to be stuck at home all the time playing video games and getting more over weight so they go off and they join a sport. The kids now a days love to be more active weather it out side playing with their animal, or its running down the block or maybe even riding their bike to a friends house they go and get active. There is lots of kids who stay home. Those kids don't know the outside world and they should but some have low grades. Some student don't have lots of friends either and s

I really want you to take into consideration why I believe you should keep the grades the same. First off some kids do after school activities to get their minds off of big projects or tests, secondly some kids do sports to loose weight and finally some kids do sports to get away from family. For all of these reasons this is why you should keep it a C or higher grade.

It will actually make most of them drop out . The reason they maintain a CY average is to play sports. Maybe that's all they have to look for in the future.

Sports are important to many students life's. I think that students should not have to have a B average to be able to play a sport. If that was the case than i don't think that a lot of students would play sports because of their grades.

Sports have a major affect on many students lives, but if the grades have to a B average then i think it will disappoint many students.

In fact their wont be very many athletes in our school's sports because of their grades. Many of our games might be lost because all of the athletes will be sitting on the bench watching their teammate' s play the sport.

However if the school didn't have all of its player's then we would all look a bunch of fools because we wouldn't win as many games and we wouldn't have enough players to play certain schools. About 60 percent of our students all play a sport or even more than one sport. Therefore if the average had to be a B , then their would be less player's or a lot of hard working one's.

I have heard that you are may start to not allow the student body not able to participate in activities such as sports, and or after school activities unless they have at least a B average. It is to say that most of the student body have at least a C. I disagree with this new rule for three reasons. The first reason is that some of the students in this school learn slower than others and may not get their work finished in time, this also is to say that it is not because they don't want to do the work but because they may be overly excessive with the quality with their work.

The second reason is that in some of the after school activities can help with the lack of work being done of the timing in the way that in some of the activities that this school has ,like sports, use math and reading which in the long-run will make the students grades superior .

It has come to my attention that you are considering a policy change in the schools athletics program. Under this new policy, students with a below B average would not be allowed to participate in athletics. Personally I agree with this idea. I believe it would be beneficial to the students and the school if this policy were enacted.

First, I think it would help the students now, and later on in life, if they were required to maintain B's in their studies in order to remain on a school team. It would encourage them to raise, or sustain their grades, further helping them succeed in life. Also, many colleges do not accept students under a B average. In order to further their career as a student-athlete, they will need to maintain their grades. This responsibility primarily falls on us.

For many student-athletes, it is highly unlikely that a career of professional sports awaits them. In order to succeed in the current, and extremely competitive job-market, they need to graduate from a university, or maintain decent grades throughout high school. Students that fall behind in their studies due to the athletics program may not be able to find a job after high school.

This is why I believe our school's policy should be changed. To benefit our students now, in college, and eventually in the job market. I believe we should enact this policy to preserve our student's, their grades, and their success in life. I believe we should hold academics above athletics.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
B3815FC262CC,"Dear principle,

I believe in both sides of your decision, because there are many different reasons why students should be able to and shouldn't be able to participate in sports with a B average. I support your decision, in that I believe that academics come before sports. I also don't support your decision, because sports are good for students and they help them stay active and fit.

Having said that these are some more detailed reasons why they shouldn't participate in sports with a B average. I believe that school should come before sports, plus the students already have P.E. as a class to help them stay fit. I think that school is what students are graded on and that sports are just for fun. I also believe that academics are what help move your life forward, whether it is to college or medical school or even law school. I believe that education is an important piece of your life, and if you don't have an education, you can't fulfill the simplest of tasks, like shopping at a grocery store.

Though, on the other hand these are some specific reasons why they should be able to participate in sports without a B average. I think that students should have the choice to stay fit, without having to go out of their way to find a different sport to do to stay fit. For some students P.E. isn't enough to keep them fit, sometimes students need more than just a class period devoted to staying fit to be fit. I also believe that it is hard for some students to make their grade because a grade C average is average, and not all students are able to understand some concepts learned in school enough to pass to a grade B average.

For the few students who are extra hyper, they may not be able to concentrate on school long enough to actually get a B average. They might need sports to let out some of their energy, so that they can calm down during class and hype up during sports, it might allow other students to be able to concentrate on their school work instead of being distracted by someone else who isn't able to concentrate on school because of a disorder or an excess of energy.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

Many students try to manage to have a B average but they just can't be able to get there grades better. But what they can do is get extra credit. There are many reasons why they are able to play and one of them is that they should be aloud to play with an C average cause not that many students don't really have there grade that well when they play soccer they normally have like D' s or F' s in there class because sports are always on their mind.

Many students try there hardest to keep an C instead of dropping down to a D or an F. So C average is actually good for them.

A lot of students brag and say that the homework is too hard or they missed an assignment that they needed to turn in or that they didn't do so well on a test so there grades drop.

Your consideration of changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or activities unless they have at least a grade B average is a strong idea. The confirmation of it is causing many thoughts and opinions throughout the student body, but they should understand the process of it. The ones against the new rule is thinking that you're doing it just to make them suffer, but that's outrageous. You care for the school and the students and you're only doing it because it'll benefit them. Changing the school policy is a great way to prove to students that they have to work hard to get what they desire.

There are so many sports and activities in our school that mainly all the students like to do. For the main sports there are wrestling, football, baseball, and basketball. The activities you have a larger selection: dance committee, school store, student council, OTHER_NAME, and anything you can attend to help the school. So many students love to either play the sport and get the job done, but they have to work hard to stay in those. That's why changing the school policy to a grade B average would be a way to prove themselves.

When the students try to succeed in anything, they put all their effort into it because they actually want to. That's all they would have to do so they can stay in their sports and activities, just a put a little effort into it. You're only pushing them so they understand they need to get to the next level, to achieve that extra mile. If someone has a grade average of C, this policy would prove if they would try to get to a B to stay in their sport or activity. Some things are worth trying for, they shouldn't give up or it wouldn't amount to anything.

It wouldn't only prove their inner strength skills, but prove that they can go all the way when they need to. This benefits them later on in life as well and it shows a good representation on themselves. Each individual student who raises their grade average could end up doing better in their life, all because they wanted to stay in a sport. Helping them when they're applying for college applications is big way to show how it helps them later on in life. A good grade average, a B or higher, is a great representation on themselves and people see them as a good student who cared.

Changing the school policy is a great way to prove to students that they have to work hard to get what they desire. All you want is to provide the students with the most opportunities and see what they can return back to you. If they return it back, it proves that they are students who care for what they want and will try to get it.

Should students have over a B average on order to attend sports or any other activity? Students should have over or at least a B average in school. If you can do sports or any other activities then you are able to manage school work no matter what. Sports have a huge responsibilities. Student's grades must be over or at least a B average because you can maintain good grades, earn the privilege to attend a sport and be motivated to improve your grades even more.

First, Sports can help you be motivated in school work. A survey has been done in the school and 80% of the students said that sports do motivate them to improve their grades and achieve their goals. It has been stated that ""Some students maintain good grades for their parents and themselves to be able to do sports and/or magnificent achievements in life. Sports can be a wonderful thing to do, but also have good grades. Your good grades and sports can help you achieve goal's and give you an opportunity to be successful in life.

Second, You need to be able to earn the privilege of doing sports. If a child is only paying attention in their sport and not school then its a enormous problem for the students future. The student can be retained for many years if they only focus on sports and not their school work. No matter what people say their is always a chance to study hard and work hard for school. School may not be a huge fan of kids but if they want a better life they have to earn privileges and learn to take responsibility.

Third, Maintaining good grades is the most important thing ever in school. You can receive a scholarship for your well academics and good achievements. My sister was a honoral student and she received a scholarship for her academics. Now, she has been doing so well in life that i wish i could reach to her goal and maybe even more. Having good grades can help you do better in life. That's why sports can also lead you to a good path.

In Conclusion, a student should be able to have at least B average to attend any sport. Sports can help you be motivated in school but its a huge responsibility. Also you need to be able to earn privileges in life otherwise you will never understand how hard is to receive something special. Maintaining good grades is a wonderful thing to tell anyone in the future and be proud of to say.

I am writing this letter to you because you have decided to change the school policy on sports. I agree with you 100%. If students care so much about sports they should have to keep their grades up. If a student is not passing or doesn't have a B average they should not be aloud to play sports. If the student is so involved in whatever sport he or she is wanting to play or is playing, they will do almost anything to make the team or stay on the team. If a student is so involved in the sports then they will most likely not focus as much on there school work, which will end up making their grades drop or possibly make them fail there classes. You can get into some colleges by your athletic ability but most colleges will also look at your grades. If someone isn't as good of an athletic but have better grades they will most likley chose the person with the better grades. The reason I think they would chose the person with better grades is because we don't need to become a football or basketball player to live ,and there are a lot of people needing medicine or a good place to live and yes you can help these people but if you are a football player or some kind of player you will put that before anything because you don't want to look bad in front of your team or on NFL or NBC. I would love for this policy to be changed because students should strive and work hard for a good education. A lot of countries ,and even some cities, don't have the privilege to get to come to school and learn how to read or write. We should not take advantage of our opportunity to have a good school and good teachers. Some kids care more about sports than their grades but in the future, how many kids out of that class will end up a pro. star?

2D28CE622B8E,"Dear principal:

I don't agree to this policy change because not all students can be able to get a B or A on the report card. Sports is the only thing that we thing is fun from school. Is the thing that keep us from going back home early, take care of our annoying siblings or even going to a little kids party with the family. Their also the reason that a lot of students have their grades up and there's not that much fighting. Something important that they care about is their appearance to be honest, if theirs no cute football players nobody besides their family will attend, because girls don't want to see some ugly guy to be the quarter back that is representing us and our school.

Oh and there's another point sports represent our school, you don't want some wimps as the football players, because they will probably loose all the games and the school will be known as the wimpiest school in the whole district and I know me or any other students will want that at all, because if that happens like I said there will be fighting, really bad grades from the majority of all the students and the teachers will have to deal with us another whole hour teaching us something we should already know. Another thing that goes with that is that all the effort we have put in all these years will disappear and never come back, and sorry if I sound really disrespectful but is all true nothing of this is a lie.

Now if you are going to take out all the other curriculum activities just for us to have a B well your high level classes will be almost empty, because in my pre-ap math class all the students have a high C and even a low B but that is all. Also all humanities students have a high D or a C but no higher than that. And again principal it all depends in you not us.

You and your co-workers have been considering to change the policy regarding the grades a student has to earn to be able to play sports. The grade average will be changed to having at least a B average to play sports, instead of the prior grade average, a C. In my opinion, I agree that the policy should be changed.

There are many reasons as to why the policy should be different. One argument that you could make is that it would encourage students to work harder on their education. If they are not able to make the grades that are required, then they will not be able to play the sports that they enjoy. Giving the students this extra push to succeed will help them later on in life. For example, colleges are concerned in not only one's athletic capabilities, but also their academic qualities. I believe that a college would not accept someone who is an amazing athlete, but can only maintain a below average grade. Exchanging the grade average from a C to a B to play sports can help the student body in the future.

Another reason that the grading average should be changed is that it could help the sports teams out. If the team has players that can asses a situation and think things through, then the team will be successful. One thing that teachers can all agree on is that to make it in this world, you have to be able to analyze a situation and find the best resolution for that problem. For instance, if there is a soccer team and the forward is dribbling the ball, and he/she asks themselves whether they should shoot the ball to score a goal, or pass the ball to another player, they will need to be able to make the better choice. Being able to quickly think things through will allow them to make the proper decision. This skill can be taught by our thoughtful teachers in the classroom. The capability of making decisions that benefit everyone is a skill that the sports teams could learn by keeping a B average grade.

Some people may disagree. They say that it is unfair to not include players with a C average. People argue that some of the best players have those grades, and that it would hurt the teams to reject them. When they say this I would like you to ask yourself this; ""Do the players with a C average deserve to be on a sports team?""

The average grade to be on a sports team should be a B. It could benefit students in the future and it could even help the sports teams think more efficiently. It would be extremely foolish to allow a low grade such as a C to be tolerated at our school.

E8A04869CFD0,"I think that the new policy is un fair because many people struggle with grades and don't get much exercise out of school and the grade standards are to high.

first the average person is pacing all classes with b, c or ,a but having a b in every class is just to much what if a person has so many hopes of playing a sport and gets a c and has all a's that is not really fair or is it.

Some people don't exercise at home and they don't get inuf. that wont just affect your emotions of being sad but it well also affect your health and you might have a higher risk of getting diabetes or cholesterol.

last the standards are to high me i am trying to stay in wrestling and i am failing two classes and my highest one is a c it would be super hard to try and get all of them up to a b.

I do think this policy is a good idea. It keeps kids wanting to do better in their classes so they can do the sports they love. Because of sports, some kids think it is okay to be slacking on their work. Just because they have practice or are the stars of their team does not mean they can not worry about school work. Having this policy keeps students on their toes about keeping up their grades and doing well. It also may encourage them to do better. The students that have at least a grade B average know that they can juggle sports and school at the same time. The coaches also have that comfort that the students are not going to fail. Also some activities may require students to be a little smarter. In the long run, students may thank their principal for pushing them to try their best because that might have helped them get into the collage they wanted to go to or get a scholarship. Therefore, I think changing the policy for students to have at least a grade B average is a great idea.      ",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
8DFCC03C34D8,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

When considering whether or not to allow children to participate in sports or other activities without an average above a C, what one must remember is that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Yes, many people excel in academics, but there are others, who math and science just don't click with them. By saying these more athletically inclined individuals cannot participate in their medium, you take away one of their great pleasures. Some kids get a rush when they find out they aced their midterm, but others take greater pleasure in scoring the winning touchdown or participating in a club where you help others. Without something for the non-academic children to shine at, their confidence may be slashed leaving devastating consequences throughout the rest of their lives.

There are many speculations and theories as to why some kids can't perform as well as others in school, and so they turn to sports or other clubs. Many of these theories include that they just have too much energy and can't stay focused, or these children have bad time management and so they don't do their homework or complete their assignments. Clubs and sports can allow the underachievers to get out some of their excess energy, so they can stay on task and perform better. When they are practicing four days a week with games on the weekend, kids don't have times to dilly-dally, so they learn time management and perform better in class.

By taking away clubs and activities unless they have a certain grade, one may be removing the one and only aspect of school that certain individuals enjoy. By causing them to hate school more, one is discouraging a better performance. Some say that sports cause kids to not focus on school as much and that by forcing them to have higher grades before they can join you get immediate results, but sometimes it just makes students angrier. To get the best results, better grades should be encouraged through sports. Instead of just saying no if a student has a certain grade, help could be offered.

School sports and clubs should be allowed no matter what the students grade is. This is very beneficial to a student's health, confidence, and can even improve their schoolwork.

0A3818A64CF5,"Dear. Mr. principal i think that you changing putting a new school policy is completely unfair and its just total trash because many students well be very disappointed with this change. now im writing you this letter because i wanna try to change you disesion with a couple of reasons on what might be best for our beloved school.

first i think students will be mad and they will hate you for that and will never like you again. Second if you reduce the amount of children playing sports not only will that piss them off it well make them over weight even more then what they already are, i mean America is known for having the most over weight children you redusing the physical activity's will only make it worse. My third reason is that maybe if the teachers would tech better then the students wouldn't have such bad grades, and another thing is that some of the best players have bad grades and arnt able to do the sports they love to do just because of the grades.

My fourth reason is that if all the good players where kicked of the teams do to there poor grades then the school wouldn't be able to win any champion ships of be know for being good at a sports.

Bottom line is pleas pleas don't do that change to our school it only gonna make it a even worst school then it already is so for the sake of our over weight students and for all the kids that are good at sports DO NOT make this type of change for our school. Thank you for you time i hope you take this letter in to mind and listen to us for once.

I think that the new regulation of only being able to participate in sports or other after school activities if you have at least a b average is a good idea. Kids need to get there grades up and in high school you are not allowed to be on a team unless you keep up your grades so teaching them to do that know is a grate idea. That way by the time we get to high school we will be used to that staidly of only being able to do the other activities if we keep our grades up to standard.

Another good thing about this policy is that less kids will be goofing off during class and more will be concentrated on there work and studies so that they will get at least a b average so that they can be able to do the things that they would like. More kids will make principles honor roll or even just honor roll and will be able to take higher classes because they are keeping there grades up.

That will also better prepare us for the rest of our life. When we are looking to go to collage most collages want people with better grades than a c average so because of this rule we will start getting into the habit of getting those good grades and hopefully that will carry on with us threw out high school and even on. Once we go on and get a job we will ( or at least most of us) still have the same work ethic and will work hard and do well. Instead if this was never a rule some of us would have never had to try to get a better than a c average or have a better work ethic.

2388E2CAC922,"Dear Principle,

I think it is not a wise decision to pass a policy where you cannot play sports without a B average. The reason so is that not everyone can surpass academically, but many can physically. Just because you don't excel in academics, doesn't mean you cant graduate either. Sure you are required to get good grades to even graduate or go to college, but you can do that along with practicing in sports. But not just sports but other activities as well.

Just getting good grades in classes generally can take you far in your career, but what kind of careers would you be able to choose with a limited amount of knowledge just from regular classes? When kids choose activities they think they would enjoy, it opens up more experience and knowledge for future career choices. If a kid wants to do the school newspaper, he/she could grow up to be a journalist or a reporter for the news. Or if a boy wants to be an actor, he could join the drama club.

There are many brilliant futures to many Kids with different types of classes and the knowledge given to them. There many places in society where they feel like they belong.

Taking special classes will deprive them of this possible future. We kids are the next generation to run things in society, don't you think it's only fair that you can give us our own chance to succeed with our own special skills in life?

But along with careers, kids just want to have fun in their classes. Kids will find school more entertaining to be able to do such activities. They might even become motivated to do better in school if they find school worth coming to. These kinds of options are all about thinking ahead. Like what would happen to the students if I do this? How will it benefit the school? Is this the right decision to make? these questions can make a big difference in the future. Not to make any offense principle, but it is important to follow such guidelines as those. I don't run the school, but it's always good to have the consent of the student who come to it.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
A98FC0B6F0FA,"Dear Principal,

I agree with the policy you have suggested.

The reason is because some students are lazy to do their work.

Then, they wouldn't want to do the work and get distracted by other things.

For example, they might start daydreaming about sports or the mall, or look out the window.

Students have to earn the fun they have.

If a student isn't doing their work in school, why are they allowed to have fun with school activities?

Students with at least a B average work hard to do their work to the best of their ability.

For the work they have done, they deserve a break from work, which are the school sports and activities.

Students that have a C average are most likely sluggish and don't want to their work for basically no reason at all.

If they goof around and such, why should they be allowed to participate in sports and activities?

They shouldn't be allowed to.

It's a student's own fault to be goofing around.

For instance, if a grade C average cuts school and hangs out at a restaurant, they wouldn't learn the principles of the subjects the other students in their school are learning.

Then, they might come back for sports at physical education and have even more fun.

Your point of view is logical because their not having their education properly.

I agree with you and say they shouldn't have access to sports and activities.

I think that would be a bad idea ,because most students have a C average on their report cards. That would leave a lot of people missing out on connections such as physical education. Their wouldn't be any one on any of the school sports like football, basketball, lady basketball, baseball, wrestling, and track. If you were to do this that would mean we would have to cancel sports because of the lack of members. Most average students a least get one C on their reports. I think this policy should be changed because it wasn't well thought out idea.

Parents will complain and demand that their child should play in a after school sport or activity. Even when you would get a C average it means your barely passing. This should tell most of the players to get their average right ,and stop getting low grades. If that works then students will realize that if they want to participate in any kind of activities they should get on the right track.

My belief is that a lot of kids get lazy and don't do the work.

So I am against this policy because this could affect many kids or young adults in their future career. Some teachers may not think so but just go head and ask the coaches or the teachers who organize these activities. Ask them and just here to what they'll tell you.

I think that ALL students should be able to be in sports because if not the rate of obesity will increase in our school because people that don't have a B and above won't be able to do cheer leading, track & field, football, basketball, swim team, or cross country. That would be very devastating to those who study but just can't keep a good grade. People that make C' s and bellow need to be athletic, to have a team to support them in whatever they do, to pray for them before a test or a game, to be by there side every step of the way. School is ""One giant step for man, But one giant leap for mankind"". By that I mean it's very hard to complete school when you don't have and athletic reputation to withhold, because your made fun of for not being in sports. Also if you made only B' s and up can be in sports a policy, then other kids would know that child doesn't have a good grade and he/she could be made fun of for that by more intelligent children. Trust me, I've been in that position before and it's not fun getting harassed for having bad grades or not being in the ""right sport.""

This change could help or hurt the school. Depending on the various side effects. I'm not sure exactly what my opinion is. This could boost the grades of students to a B' average witch will boost the overall school grades or bring them down and cause a weight problem for the people who don't play out side at home.

If you did make these changes it could make the average C student pull their grade up to a B average depending on wether or not that student participates in school Activities / Sports etc. This makes the overall school report card better than C average and most students' parents would be proud. Causing the school's ratings to shoot through the roof.

It could also make the average students' grades drop drastically causing a serious problem and parents would become very upset. Also including the school report card to drop and have the side effect of a minor weight problem with in the school. Inclining child hood obesity witch is a world wide problem in today's

I heard about your idea on changing the policy so that all sports players must have a B average. I think that this is a fairly good idea, that could end up pushing players to work harder. This would push the athletes to focus more on school than on sports. The reason for school is so that people can educate them self better, not so someone could play sports.

The idea of student athletes having to make a B average is a big change for some athletes. Although it is a big change, I think it would push athletes to do better if they really want to play. This will also influence some kids that look up to these student athletes. So all around i think this would end up being better for the schools and the player.

Indeed some of my fellow students will not feel the same way. Some of them will say that then a student athlete is expected to do more than an average student, but they already do a lot more than an average student. Some could say that it is not fair to some of the athletes that usually get C' , but in return is life fair in any way? life is full of hard challenges that you have to over come, and this will just help some students to over come more things in the future. I know once they look at the changes it could make for the better of the athlete and the school they will see where i think this would work the best.

In conclusion, I can see where you thought this was a good idea and i agree with you. Also i see where it could be perceived as a bad idea from other students, but this is a good way to show everyone that these athletes are willing to go above average and be someone people look up to.

The rule on the policy that you must have a B grade point average to play sports or be in other activities is ridiculous i don't know if you are making this rule cause your being mean or you think if we all try hard enough we will succeed. But its not fair in my opinion. Yes some people don't put effort into their work and misbehave a lot but what about the people who are actually trying and still not averaging a B its not there fault and i' m sure they would like to try out for sports or try extra curricular activities.

Please sir reconsider this rule its bit much to ask from students of our age and work ability. Were teenagers this is the best time of our lives we want to go outside and hang out with friends and actually live. We already have to go to school for eight hours a day five days a week. Do you think we want to spend the time we have at home doing the work we got from school? we already have homework and test in eight different classes and to say we have to average a B in all those classes is going to put more pressure on us then we already have.

Its also about education what if a football player is not as smart as the others but he wants to go to college and he was hopping to get a scholarship from the school he wanted to attend by playing football but just cause he isn't averaging a B he cant play that sport and now he cant go to college.

I for one have never been a big part of participating in sports to be quite honest with you. My grades have always been one of my top prorites as a student. I have lived my whole life watching people play sports and other activities and how that effects them as a human being so to tell you the truth I think that your new "" B average only"" scenario is absurd. Now hold on a minute, I'm not trying to be rude but just wait and hear my side of the story.

I think that if you took this B average policy into action that it would anger the student body as a whole. While I do understand that sometimes you have to do things that people wont necessarily agree with you have to side with the student body sometimes too because they have to respect you. You will turn already rebellious students into ones that come into your nightmares.

First let me tell you what taking away sports to those children would to. Most importantly some children just aren't well how do I put this nicely, the smartest children out there. I'm not trying to be mean but sometimes no matter how hard a student tries to do there work they just do not grasp the material enough to comprehend it resulting in poor grades. Even if they do not excel in school they may do better in other areas such as sports or the arts. If you took away these kids rights away to sports just because they don't get the information that would be like denying a child food because it misbehaved.

Sports also play a big part in our health. Did you know that studies show that 1/3 of all children from Massachusetts are obese? When I heard that it made me think of what this country is doing to its children that we are the way we are today. Sports keep us healthy and only a moron wouldn't be able to see that clearly. If we want to improve the health of this state, if we want to improve the health of this nation we have to start adding more daily activity to a child's life. I'm not even a sports sort of person but to take away sports just based on grades alone would be like taking a step back in the process to make the children of America healthy.

Today's teenagers live in a society that is basically based off our stereotypes and while I do understand that this is not necessarily true in some places, for the commen teen this is a rule of life. We are placed in our little packages and labeled as nerd, jock, and the artsy types among other groups of people. I'm not saying I agree to this because as far as labeling people goes because I don't but you have to understand that to some people this label is who they are, its almost become their way of life and you would just make them rebel if you took that privilege away from them.

I know that you see education as something important and I for one see it the same way but sometimes people are in such a different mind set that you cant change the way they view things no matter how much you try to. People one day might want careers outside of academia so you have to give them that option as well, to embrace what they are good at and love to do. I think that as long as the student isn't in D or F range for their over all grade that they should be allowed to participate in these school activities. You have to draw a line somewhere but drawing the line with C range students is not the place to draw such a line.

Your the principle but think about how you grew up? Was there ever something that was your passion to do other than school work? That's how it is for some of these kids but however more intense. For some its the way they live. High School and Middle School are places where you have to find who you want to be and taking away sports and other activities would be like denying them of that chance. So Mr. Principle put yourself in our shoes, our poor confused shoes that are still trying to figure out what we want to do with our lives. We need this policy to stay out of our school system because not only will you have rebellion, a higher chance of obese children, but your C students will have lost their identity in a way.

I think that your idea is an excellent idea.

There are to many people who play sports or other things and than after they get hurt or can't play are left with nothing. So many people, athletes especially, don't even make it to college because they have spent so much time in practice or in games. If you can't maintain at least a B average then where do they expect to go when they are done playing.

My personal experience is a great one. I have two older brothers. One is 31 and the other 27. My older brother just finished his masters degree in marketing and is now working on his own company not only trying to take that far past his expectations, but is also going around the U.S. doing speech and debate contest. The other one is a high school graduate who is now working at the OTHER_NAME hotel as the head bar manager. Both great jobs, but different life styles. There is one major difference between the two though. One has gone of to college and the other stopped at high school. RELATIVE_NAME my 27 year old brother has had a great life so far, but always having his burden of not going to college. The reason is, is that he didn't have a good enough GPA. He played sports his whole life and was the star. He had one to many injuries though to keep on going. By the time he realized that he wouldn't be getting a scholarship because he was done getting hurt and didn't want to play was when he also realized that he couldn't get into college because of his grades.

This is why you shouldn't be allowed to play sports unless you have a B average. If this was the case when my brother played football he might have a completely different life. With a B average even if sports or some other activity doesn't take you where you want to go you know that you will have your back up plan with your grades.

Excuse me but what i would like to say is that it would not be right if you change the requirements. Say that you would change the requirements what do you think would happen well let me tell you briefly. What would happen is that mainly everyone maybe even the most smartest people in the school have had a ""C"" average. So changing the requirements would pretty much get rid of almost every person in the sports teams. If you were to change the average requirements then you would pretty much be getting rid of every team including, The chess teams, Math teams , and every other scholastic team there is in the school by changing the requirements i would think that you are just giving up on your school. i have to say not everyone can maintain at least a ""B"" average it is very hard and just look at your students records that will tell you everything that i was just explaining. Mostly all of the students here get a ""C"" once and every while what you have to do is just be patient with everyone and at least try to consider the possibility of making the average to ""C"" if this happens you wont be sorry.

Having this brief argument i hope that you have learned that you are not just getting rid of your teams you are getting rid of your students and that is the complete truth from all of the students. but also it would also be an issue with the parents because some of them pay so much money just to see that their kid is not going to be in the activity because of just a little bad grade i hope that you see that and that sometime you may change it in the early present while you still have some chance of gaining your students trust and respect again. Some day your students will thank you for putting the average back down and you would have made some people really happy.

I think that would be a good idea but at the same time it would be a bad one. The reason why i think it would be a good idea is because if people wanted to do sports and they had a C or lower, they would work on getting their grade up and they would learn more things if they payed more attention and they got their work in. I think it would help the students too because if they just kept failing every class they wouldn't have as good education as if they did pay attention and they would have a better life because it would help them in life. Another thing why i think it's a good idea is because people would get used to getting as B or higher and they would probably keep it that way.

Why i think it would be a bad idea is because what if people really liked the sport but they couldn't play in it because their grade was around a C and it was hard to get it up and then people couldn't join the team so they didn't get to play. There wouldn't be very much people on the team as if it was a C or higher. Another reason why i think it is a bad idea is because students wouldn't want to join a sport anymore if it was a B or higher and the students would start getting lazy and their wouldn't be as much athletic people as before. I think more people would rather just have it as a C instead because they would be able to get the C instead of the B because it would be harder for them to get the B and keep it that way.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I do not like the new school policy of having a B average to attend a sport. I think that a C average is fine. I think it is fine because a C is in the middle of an A,B,D, and F. Also if a kid has a nice amount of B's and struggles in a class and has and F the kid my not be able to play the sport even though he/she is giving there most effort.

Another reason is that the kid my have a bad teacher or a teacher thet he doesn't understand the best and that my effect his/her grade.

If they make a B the average i believe they my be losing a good amount of the kids that play some sports. I think this is unfair to kids who give a lot of effort playing the sport and there grade average.

All in all I think they should keep the grade average of playing a sport a C. If they move it up whats not saying that they wont eventually change it to an A average. I also think there wont be as many kids taking part of a sport. Lastly I think kids need a way to be fit and healthier and taking part in a spot would help that. If they top taking or doing a sport they my become less healthy.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I am writing this letter to you regarding your idea of changing the school sports policy, I agree and disagree with what you are trying to do. Have you looked at the Pro's and Con's?

Did you consider that maybe the average C students have been having problems at home and sports is the only fun thing that they can really do? I'd like to know what you would do with this policy if every student willing to participate in school sports was a C or even possibly D student, would you leave it alone or change it?

It would be very unfair if you were to go through with your idea there are for sure students who are trying to be successful in school but do not fully understand the material that we are being taught. You're probably thinking well if sports were so important to them then they should make a better attempt with trying to understand the material being taught like going to tutorials. Well if you looked at the records you should see that there is a greater amount of students showing up.

My other point of view on your idea is that perhaps if they do care for sports so much this would be a bit of a drive for them and they would want to be on the sports team so it would be a win-win situation for both of you. You would win because you'd get to change it for what ever reason you'd like to change it; the student would win because they would be able to join the sports team and get they're grades higher as well. Of course there is no way of telling what the out come will be.

I think that the new school policy about students with at least a B average can only participate in sports or other activities is unfair. The reason I think this is because most students have C averages and are great athletes. Also to some people C averages are okay. I think that most people with C averages probably failed a test or didn't bring in some homeworks and the reasons to punish them to not being in sports is absurd.

Sometimes students have a C+ and then it goes up or a C+ and they don't have time to make it up. I mean this never happened to me because I don't make C's or anything lower but telling people that they cannot join a sports team for it is so unreasonable.

Another specific reason Is that people just don't have time or can't study. I think maybe having the team a little later when students get used to their studying and planning , then grades of school athletes might get better.

The only thing I am arguing for is changing the policy from a B average to a C average because unless you don't want great athletes if so then I say you change it !",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
5E8943E437AC,"NEW GRADE POLICY?

Hello and how are? First of all I would like to thank you for the time you are about to give, I do know you are very busy so I will try to be brief. I have recently been notified of the change in sports to grade policy. I think that, that is a bad idea. Many of the sports players have a C average so with the grade policy they can not play and we would no longer have as many sports teams as we do. I do know that grades should come first but what If instead of having a B average to play we make after school study groups which is mandatory for all of the sports players, and we can let some of the strait A students touter them. This way we are not only letting more people play but we would increase as a community.

We also should not follow that rule because as I said before a lot of kids would not be able to play. Some of the kids who wouldn't be able to play would lose there fun time. A lot of kids use sports to have fun and get away from there everyday stress. With taking that away kids may be discouraged and stop trying all together. I am also a sports player so I know how these people feel.

So as I stated before we should keep the grade C policy and make study groups to help people get there grades up. Doing this we would be helping many people and encouraging many people to bring up there grades. I encourage you to take these points into consideration and if you can change the policy back to a C average so everyone can continue to play the sports that they do. Thank you again for your time.

674CA6631291,"Dear Principal,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I would like to explain to you why I think it would be a good idea to make only people with B averages be allowed to play sports or activities.

Many students in our school have a C average. Which means that a lot of people in the school could not play any sports or activities. I understand your reasons for why you would like students who have a B average to participate and I strongly agree.

First, in my opinion, if you cannot get your homework in on time, how could you also have extra time to play a sport, non the less an activity. Some parents tell there children ""school comes first.""

I do not believe that you can put your full effort into a sport or activity if you cannot even get your homework in on time. I understand some people may have been gone a day or week but they will be excused and have extra time to do that assignment.

Next, you might be the kind of person who might not study, well, with this new school policy, more students might be encouraged to do so, and take some time out of there spare time and study which will help them out in the long run. Plus, this makes the children want it more, so, they might try harder.

As you can tell, I think that the new school policy is a great idea. With this rule, it will hopefully make students to be more responsible and focused. In addition, it's not incredibly hard to even get a B average. I am an A average student and it's not the end of the world if you study before a test or turn in your homework.

I am a very concerned student. You are thinking of changing the sports grade policy. I and fellow students disagree and think this is a very bad idea. Changing the grade policy on sports would enrage both young men, and women. You would be taking away their encouragement to go to school. So for the sake of the school and your view as a good principal listen to what I am about to say.

By changing this policy a good percentage of the sports players would be kicked off the team. Students who no longer can see their favorite player(s) perform would be disappointed and there goes your school spirit. Also sports players would not do their work to try at what they think is get back at you, some may even go to the extreme of dropping out or transferring. The students who do the unthinkable and drop out would ruin their lives without even knowing it and you would be partially to blame.

The players who stayed in school, well their dreams of becoming a athlete would be crushed without them even getting to pursue it. Most of the players would become out of shape for their feeling of the lack of need to play or exercise anymore. By that act it would cause overweight minors or obesity ,later causing health issues.

These health issues conclude, diabetes, high cholesterol, heart problems, angina pains, and trouble breathing during little physical activities, caused by their over eating caused by being emotional. These issues cause depression, lack of interest, and or mental lapses. So please take this under a very serious condition. This one mistake can ruin lives dreams and agility's.

I think that the policy should be that students should have to at least have a grade of B average. There are a few reasons that this should happen. One reason that people should have to have a grade B average is that students studies should definitely come first. Another reason is that it would encourage students to try to get there grades up higher and to not slack off in school. The last and final reason that students should at least have a B average in the school is that every person on the sports team would be smarter, which would possibly mean that the sports teams would become more about strategy than about brute strength, making the teams more deserving of what they earn and more enriching for themselves.

A persons studies should come before any sport. When a person gets good grades, that guarantees that they will at least get one spot in college some where which helps them get an advance in life. If a person were to rely on sports for their life, they are not guaranteed anything in the sports industry. Another thing is that if you are going to rely on sports, to get drafted into any sort of sports team, you need to be one of the best of the best on a college team. You cannot be the best of the best on a college team if you do not even go to college. Even if you get into a college, you have to have a 2.5 grade average to be drafted into any sport. Which is requiring slightly good grades.

Making it so that you can not get into any sports teams with out a B average is just more incentive fort the students to get higher grades and not slack off in any of their classes. Most people that play sports are very intelligent, they just choose in school, to only get the minimal requirement to play sports in their school because they do not want to do much work. Making it so that B is the minimal requirement will make it so all sports players that are only going for the minimal will be forced to get to that grade.

Every person n the sports teams would become smarter and the team would lean towards using their brain and not their brute strength so much. People would start to strategise and the sports teams would start to get better. Over all this is just a great decision for the school that will not only help the academic portion, but it will also help the athletes of the school. They will boost their grades and they would boost their ability to strategise, and there fore their ability to go further in life, and not just as an athlete.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I still don't like the idea but i understand what you are doing. If a student wants to play sports that bad they do there hardest to raise there grade up.

If half 75% students are playing sports that means they are making good grades. but no every student is like that though you cant punish the students just because they don't make a B grade average.

1CAEAE4A474A,"Dear Principal:

Many people love playing sports, sometimes they love it so much they don't think about how they are doing in school. Changing the school policy so that you have to have at least a grade B average can be good for these people. It would be good because most people would do better in school, they would think more about school, and they would work harder.

Many students have a grade C average, with this policy most of those C averages most likely would go up to B averages. This is because there are most likely a lot of people who love sports and if they want to show that they love them they will raise their grades to be able to play those sports or activities. People like to have fun and they would know in order to have fun they need a good grade.

Thinking about school is something that helps when you're trying to get good grades. Once you start thinking about school you start working harder to do your best. Thinking about keeping a good grade makes people think about school more which they need to do so they can do their best in order to live their dreams of growing up and having a good paying job.

Lastly, people would work harder in school. Working harder in school is essential to getting good grades and, in this case, doing something you love to do. When people work harder in school then they will be more prepared for what's ahead of them like college, work, anything that requires skill and knowledge. Once you know how to work hard and do your best you are ready for almost anything.

In my opinion this policy change sounds perfect for a school. People will do better in school, think more about school, and work harder. All of these things will help them in their future in many different ways. This is a very good policy.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

Students need to realize that school comes before sports because if you do good in school you will go farther in life.

Sports should be a reward not just something you get any ways. Those on the opposing side think that a C average is passing but soon it will be a D average and then some kids will start failing their classes.

Students need to learn how to be responsible.

It is a privilege to be able to play sports and if someone took sports away from me it would push me to do better in school so i could play sports.

A lot of students who are good enough to play college sports won't be able to because of their grades.

Keeping your grades up to a B average could help you in the future when you are old enough to get a job.

A company might be comparing you to someone who has a B average and you have a C average they will most likely pick the B average.

If you keep your grades up to a B average you would have a better chance of getting into college than if you had a C average.

I have to say that ,I myself an 8th grader disagree, on your new school policy.

For the fact that , having a ""C"" average is better than an ""F"" average? Sports have influenced me the most, throughout the school year to keep my grades up. Our coaches here at SCHOOL_NAME, have kept the athletes informed, of some important information. Meaning in order to be an athlete , your grades have to be 75 or above.

If we do not meet the requirements we must not play in a game or also have some type of punishment, meaning running extra etc. . Being an athlete is very difficult. In my opinion I think, what the coaches are doing is fine. To change the school policy, i' m positive we would not exactly have a full team , 75 or above rule helps us all out. It gives our students the time to make up the grade.

My parents have always, told me in order to not be punished to bring home at least a 75 or up. I've been ""A"" , ""B"" honor roll, since kinder. Unlike most parents, my parents care about my education and at the same time they want me to have fun. so ,I became an athlete.

First because, they should prove they are able to keep their grades up. Second because, you shouldn't treat them in doing any activity they enjoy when their grades are bad. And third because, they shouldn't get what they want. It's not the teacher fault when they show poor effort.

First, because they should prove they are able to keep their grades up. By doing that they would be able to enjoy the activity's and stuff. Instead of failing and can't do sports with your friends. Proving that they are ready. If not they will be the only student failing and can't attend any sport just because of a simple grade.

Second, because you shouldn't treat them in any activity they enjoy when their grades are bad. For instead, they would think its cool for having horrible grades. And wouldn't do anything to save themselves for passing to the next level. And what will they do when others are laughing at them. they should prove themselves that they are learning in order to join others in activity's and sports.

Third, they shouldn't get what they want. Meaning they know they can do the activity's when their grades suck. NOT going to happening. Teachers are working hard just so they can be something in life. so they should show effort. And by them doing all of this they could join in the sports and activity's they want to do.

I like this policy because there are many students who are struggling with their grades that like to play sports or do other activities. So this will encourage them to boost their grades up. If students are struggling academically then this will give them another reason to try and keep their grades up. Even though they may not realize it, this will be helping them in another way, it will also help their GPA and make them more qualified for better schools rather than students with C averages. So if these students really have a desire for sports then they will try their hardest to keep their grades up.

Kid's should try to have a B average in school. They would get so many rewards with there parents like they would give them all they want if they had good grade. Having B average is something that i would be proud of and so would be my parent. Sometimes its just hard to do everything right all the time and try not to get anything wrong and do all your homework and make your teacher happy by doing everything they say. But sometime they can be really annoying once they tell do this they tell you to do other thing i mean can u make up your mind lady. Well yea all of that can get really annoying. All of theses thing they want us to do and when we don't do it right they get mad. Yeah having B average can pretty hard to keep. Well its still a good idea because it can prepare you for collage and other hard things to accomplish in the future and help you be a better person.      ,2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

I am writing this letter to inform you that students should have a Grade B average to be able to compete in sports. It would be better for them to do so because if they miss a day they wouldn't be so far behind.

First I would make some of the kids miss some of there practices and stay for tutoring.

I would make sure that they stayed for tutoring and there grades were going up to a B point average. I would contact there parents and tell them that there child had to have a B point average before playing sports.

Second I would let them go to some of there practices if there grades were improving.

I would tell the student to do better in school and not act up so much. I would stay in contact wit the student until he or she was doing better. I hope that the student does better.

Finally, I would make sure the student was doing a lot better and tell him he didn't have to stay for tutoring anymore. I would let him start going back to his practices and be more careful in school and pay more attention. If his grade started to back down he would have to stay for tutoring and not go to many practices.

I hope you like my idea of making the student having the B point average.

What I think you have chosen to do is a good idea, but I think it could leave a couple students in a bad situation. For school, the whole purpose is to get an education so that kids can have a brighter and better future in their life. But I think that you should at least keep it to a C grade and up average, because if kids parents like them doing sports, whither their un-active or they want to get a sport scholarship to get them in college. It could mess that whole thing up if they're not able to participate in sport activities. I think kids should definitely take their school lives more seriously, but not letting them go into sports to represent their school is sort of punishing them. If you don't think what I'm writing to you makes sense, then another idea I have that might be more reasonable, is that you could open a set of classes that could help raise grades. Like what we have now, Math Enhancement. It definitely helps gets that are struggling in math, so why not other classes? Plus, it raises their grades and let's them participate in sports.

And if that doesn't work out, to where the kids are getting lower grades every card marking, but you're still letting them play sports. Then I think you should take them off of their activity till at least they start getting a better grade in their classes. So then by that way, they'll understand that sports won't always get you through things in life; that education is also a very important roll we have to do too. Kids think they'll get away with a lot of things throughout their life, but they don't realize it till they can't avoid it any longer. That's why I think you should still let the kids play, even with a mid-C average for a grade. But if the kids are going to take a disadvantage of it, then by all means take them off the team/activity group. That way it'll teach them a lesson for education and in the other hand, it could give them a break off their busy sports schedule and just relax.

There's many ways to give a kid a good education and still let them play their sports. You just got to sit down with them and talk to the kid and their parents about ways to get a good grade and a fun sports experience. Also like I had written earlier in the note, you could open up more classes to help raise grades for kids or make them stay after school to do a class on teacher sessions where a group of kids work with a teach or teachers, and they all work as a group in getting a better understanding and grade for school.

I'm not going to lie, this process may take time. Yet, with patience and determination, you can get a better school, with smarter kids, and the kids can get what they wanted in the first place; to be able to play a sports activity for their school.

You're idea for the new requirement in order to play school activities, such as sports. Is a good idea and I can see where you're coming from to come up with that idea, I just think their's other ways to avoid that conflict and to let everyone get what they want. It just might be a more ""looking into"" process.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I have heard that you may be considering changing school polices that students may not participate in sports unless they have at least a grade B

I think that if the student is failing one or more classes then he or she should not participate in sports until he or she gets his or her grades up. I understand you may think that the students should have a grade B average because it is important too keep your grades up even if your playing a sport but i still highly recommend that you make it a grade C

average because it will allow more students too play the sport that they would like too play but the catch is that if they do not keep there average up they can not continue too play that sport that they choose they will just have to focus on grades so they can play that sport .

Kids have always played sports, with no set grade average. Requiring the students to have at least a B grade average will not only stifle the kid's ability to participate in after school activities, it would require them to try and push themselves even harder than they are now, which is a huge additive of stress to their current amount. Many kids have a C grade average, and are trying their hardest to keep it there. Kids in my school, have lots of homework to do already. Because of the amount of homework that is put upon kids every day, kids would not be able to participate in sports as much as they would without an average grade requirement.

Given the current amount of kids that play sports at least one season out of the year, most have about a C average. If you required kids to have at least a B average, then those many kids would have to quit sports, and would not be allowed to play until they brought their grades up to a B in every class, at the least. With the struggle of at home conflicts, and other factors, like music lessons, and sports that kids already play, keeping their grades up is a huge issue.

Most often, kids who play sports, have a easier time keeping their homework completed, but that does not necessarily mean that they get all A' s on their homework and their tests. Sports help kids clear their minds. Kids with C averages would not be able to reap the benefits of the extra curriculum activities.

Creating the B average minimum on sports would add a burden to the kids, as much as it would if at work, an adult was asked to do extra paper work every day, and no one wants that. So please take into consideration what you are doing and if you benefit the learning of the students.

If many of the students have grade C average who will join the sports to represent and play for their school. Many of the all star players in the schools do not have a grade B average and their making the team win a lot and that will help the school a lot. For school activities like dancing or math club, if they do not have a grade B average who will go dance for the competitions. For other activities like the math club, they will be passing their math but what if their failing their other classes, that wont make them have a grade B average. If they don't have a grade B average who will go to compete at the math competitions. Maybe their best mathematician failed other classes and he wont be there, the school just lost their biggest advantage. This policy just makes me go crazy and mad because most kids don't have B averages and A averages a lot of people that ADHD or dyslexia need help and cant have a B average but they might be the best football, basketball or baseball player the school has. Orchestra and band players compete a lot in UIL or other competitions they even go out of the state to go compete. If their best trumpet or saxophone player is not passing and he doesn't go their school just automatically lost the first place and for orchestra if they don't have their best violin or bass player their school lost first place.

Some of us students have an outside sport that we trade in for Physical Education, and go home one period early. Many of us who do these outside activities are in accelerated classes and strive for our best. For example, most of our parents wouldn't let us have an outside sport if we had bad grades and were not trying hard enough in school. If we really wanted to play our sport, some of us might become home schooled just to achieve our greatest. But others have the idea of succeeding academic wise. If we were not able to play our sport anymore, we might not live up to our dreams.

Though many of us try hard, others just might not be able to do so well in school, and we just want to play our sport because most of our friends are there. If students had more time to study without their sport getting in the way, maybe we'd do better in school. For example, many of us might have more time for homework and studying. But if you crush someone's dreams in their sport or activity, then they will never be as happy as they used to be. The hope that used to be installed in them every day now may not exist anymore.

Our dreams and hopes can also help us in the future. For example, we can use it when trying to see what our highest expectations for ourselves are, and what we think we can achieve. If you make a statement that everybody who has a C average or lower cannot play their sport anymore, think about how angry our parents will be. To put in all that money and for it to be worth nothing anymore just because they don't have the best grades.

And they might try really hard just not be great at school, and things might not make sense in their head. So, instead of crushing hopes and dreams, you could give an opportunity of tutoring, and extra websites for us to study and review some of the skills we didn't understand so we can understand in the future. If you put out more of these activities and give us some opportunities, we might be more efficient on our grade average.

They are free to participate in any kind of sports they prefer. Some of the schools don't agree with the fact the students need a B average. That is why so many of the students in this school don't agree that we should really need a B average to play sports.

It's been going around the school that our grades are not perfect enough to participate in activity. Some students in the school may not have a B average, but that does not mean they shouldn't play sports. The reasons could be that they speak another language, like Spanish or French an may not fully understand us so well. It can also be to the fact that some kids come from different type of background family such as religion and can not study what we are leaning. Even kids that are a bit slow in learning or mentally can have a few problems with studying their objects.

Other reasons could possibly be the fact that the teachers don't quietly go slow enough to make sure that the students do not fall behind. Another reason for students to not have a B average in their score could be because of their leaning disabilities, like autism or dyslexia.

Lastly, some students at home don't have this kind of opportunity. All these reasons contribute to the changing of the school policy.

One reason why you shouldn't take away activities from students lower than a C average is because students don't comprehend the work that teachers are giving. Some students go home, sitting dumbfounded because they don't understand how the work is being done. Creating an after school program for the students will bring up their grade. This after school program should only provide homework help. Then, the students will only be focused on getting good grades.

I have heard of your new policy change and i agree with you. Many students work hard to maintain a B average and I think other students should have to work as hard to play sports. The new policy change would be good for students and their learning skills. The grade point average of students would be much better and help them in the future. The policy to have a B average to play sports may also inspire students to do better in other things outside of school such as volunteering or helping the community in other ways.

I have heard around the school and online about how you plan to make a new policy that does not allow students to participate in sports unless they have a grade B average. I along with many other students here at our proud school do not agree with this new policy. I have been asked by several students to write a letter to you stating that we do not want this new policy to become official and the reasons why.

One of the main reasons that have been told to me by the student body is that some of the best players on our teams are C average students. Without them our winning game levels will surely go down by a great amount. Even strait A students around the school want us to remain the leading champions in our district by having the other students remain on our team. School spirit is important to the students of our school in which we take pride .

One reason that effects me personally is that one of my closest friends has a C average. I have tried helping her in the past but because of personal issues at home she is not able to concentrate in class. The things she is going through make life itself hard on her. She has told me in the past that baseball is her only outlet to release all of her worries and anger. She is also one of the leading track stars at our school as well. To take her off of the team would for sure crush all of her hopes and dreams she has left.

She is not the only student at our school who is having personal family issues at home as you probably know. Many students around our school use sports to escape from their troubles. They enjoy it and it gives them something to look forward to at the end of the day.

Exercise is an important part of the deal too. Denying a child school sports is like denying them physical education. As an entire student body. A, B,C and below average students all need exercise and all go to physical education class. Some because it is required and some because they love getting exercise and makes school fun for them.

I believe that, it could be a good thing if you were to change the average to a B average, because for the kids that wan to play sport's would have to get there grades up, in order to play. For some of the kids, sports is there life and that's a big reason why they would try, and do good in school. So if you were to move the average up to B then they would try harder and not slack as much as they do. Also if you were to raise it up then the kids could get into a better college. The kids who have a C average are barley getting by, but only by enough to stay on the team, and to play the sport they wish to.

Kids would raise there grades, and they would try harder in school to stay on the team, or be able to play.

Like example for me, if i was on the high school soccer team, and i had only a C average, and i heard that they were changing it to wear you had to have a B average, and if you didn't have that then you couldn't play, and you might kicked of the team, then i would raise my grades i would try harder, try to get all my work done. I would do whatever i could to get my work done , and to raise my grade so i could keep playing on the soccer team .

If i couldn't play on a team because of my grade's, i would be embarrassed, if did, i wouldn't have any hope, because its like all your hopes are getting crushed. If i was going to get a scholarship to a college, and it was because of my grade's i didn't get in, i would be really mad. So i believe that it would be a good idea to raise the grade average up to B. There G.P.A would go up, there chances of getting into a college, or a better college would go up . Plus the kids would be able to go for sports . The way that i look at it is, if they want it that bad, and if they set there mind to it, they will do it. So if the student really wants to play a sport, but his grades are low he will make an effort to get them up.

That's why i believe that you as the principal should raise the average up to a B. The kids will put more effort into there work so they get the grade's they need and want . In the long run it will be better for them .",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

Some of the teachings are warnings that would distract me and would not find my way back to the way I was before. This is caused by drugs, pornography, murder, stealing, and etc. But the point is, one of the teachings was to put my priorities straight. He said if you do not put your priorities straight then you will have an unsuccessful future. That has been one of my goals, and that is to be sure I have a plan to know what I will be doing in the future.

One of my priorities is school. While I was growing up, I was taught to work hard for school so that I may have a successful career. I was taught to be sure to have straight A' s and not get into trouble. I was very fond of school and addicted to school until I had learned of a new hobby that I desired. That was sports. I have learned over the years that sports are distracting. The school year was combined with football. I started to nudge football as my number one priority. Therefore, my grades dropped and I was miserable. I tried everything to get back on track but my coach was always there to make sure that my athletic ability would never be lost because he needed me on the team I played for.

My parents were worried about sports how it intervened with school. So they began to make sure I would put extra hard work for school. I did everything to get back on track. Ever since I was in junior high, I have never earned a four point 0 in my GPA because of sports. But now I am losing the desire of sports because of my focus on education. I am earning better grades than I did before and I believe that this hard work will help me to receive a triumphant career.

My point is that sport players should set their priorities straight. Education should come before sports. Some people believe that if you are athletic enough to go to professional. Yes, but what if an injury occurs that could affect you whole career. Now what do you do. If your priority was a sport than education and you are not able to go back to sport then you must return back to school. You will regret it over the future. I have a brother who went to Kansas to do sales. He earned large sums of money because of his success. My father did not see this as a smart idea. He made sure that my brother would realize that his education in college was still important. He did not want my brother to rely on making money by doing sales. My father said that if troubled times come and are unemployed then you will regret the day you turned away from your education.

Yes, I do believe that you must have a B-average to play a sport. Set your priorities straight and take precaution of your education. Education is very helpful these days in America. America's economy is failing and unemployment is sky rocketing. The only thing you can turn to is your education. You need money to support your family or see your family fall apart.

I have always been told that being on a team can help you in many life skills that you need to know. So i am writing this letter because i don't think it's fair to some of the students that can't play sports and are suffering with their grades. I think there should be another way for the students to get their grades up and be able to play school sports at the same time.

Working on a team can help with teamwork skills that you can not learn by just doing projects with a group. Having the ability to work with a team has a big impact because you need to learn how to pull your own weight and not just stand back. If one student had a C so they couldn't play their favorite sport football, they wouldn't know how it felt to be part of a real team.

I think that playing sports also help you with being a good leader for the school. Every time you put on the jersey or uniform for your school you're representing it and showing how good of a school it is. If you could never have the possibility to do that you would never have the experience of being a leader for your school.

Lastly, I think that all students should learn how to have good sportsmanship towards other people and teams. What if you get a better grade on a test than someone and you rub it in their face? You would never know how the other person felt till someone did it to you. But if you were on a basketball team and you won you would know to go over to the other team and congratulate them on playing a good game. Or if you lost you would congratulate them on winning.

From the students perspective i don't think it's fair to take away sports from just having a C because i feel that being on a team is very helpful for later in life. I think that it would be unfair to take that away from students that are struggling in school. The only time that it would be necessary to take playing a sport away from a student was is he or she was failing a class.

I recently heard that you have been considering changing the grade average required in order to participate in sports or other school activities. Right now the average grade must be a C or higher in order to participate in some school activities. I believe it is a wise decision to change the requirement from a C to a B. By doing this, you will push your students harder to achieve their goals and end up with a higher amount of kids getting B' s!

I am currently a member of the schools wrestling team and I know that I would not want to come to school on some days if it weren't for wrestling practice. I can tell you that every other member on the wrestling team feels exactly the same way! If you challenged those kids to get a B average I am sure they would do their very best. This would teach them discipline and let them know that they are rewarded for good schoolwork. The students might feel like they are only trying in school so that they can partake in school activities but truly they will be helping themselves in the long run as well!

Once your students get to a high school or college they will soon learn that they need to get their grades as high as possible in order to be as successful as you want. By giving them these goals early, they will be preparing for what is soon to come. Also, when your students are in high school and are succeeding in their classes you will receive recognition for teaching them their ways.

I know that you will make the choice that you believe is best for the students and best for the school. I believe that you should change the grade average requirement to a B because more kids will persevere to get their grades up to a B and help them prepare for their future school experiences.

I don't think this is a good idea, because some students really do try their hardest but it just doesn't come to them that easy. If they do try their hardest and they really do put their effort into all their work and they don't get that B average they can't play the sport(s) they love. If they don't put any effort into their school work and they just come to play the sports, then i can see your point.

It reminds me of me, because i do try but school doesn't come easy to me, and i love to play my sports. I'm a C average girl. If we had this policy i wouldn't be able to play all the sports i love.

I get what you mean by this policy, but i don't think this is fair for the people who try really hard but just don't get the grades they would need to play. What if you go to this after school math or science thing? If you don't have the grades you wouldn't be able to go to those without a B average. Some people go to learn more about whatever subject there going to learn about. So if they had lower then a B average they wouldn't be able to go learn about the subject there staying after to learn. If they stayed after to learn it, they could do better in that class, but they cant do activities after school without that B average.

To back up my thesis i have to decide that its unfair to some children because they may not be as smart as others.

Some may just be doing work when others are doing their best but are still not passing with gold stars.

You also never know if they have a bad home life and need sports to bring them happiness.

But what if they are not smart enough to play.

I also think that a B average is to high of an expectation.

If you to make it a C average it could give the kids a warning that their grades are slipping.

Instead of making the B average an have to.

You encourage the kids maybe saying, "" Hey PROPER_NAME, Nice job on the test!

Maybe next time you could study with me in my office and get a B or maybe an A!

Great Job! Keep up the work.""

It could also overwhelm the child because he may have to do extra homework and the assignment that day.

Which might not let them play outside which all children need. Also to maintain a B average it would take a lot of work and maybe the kid works on a farm and has no time for homework during the day because he has to work all day after school.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

In my personal opinion it would be wrong to simply deny these other students an opportunity to do something as sentimental as sports. But unfortunately I understand why you would consider this.

I understand that if you enforce this new rule you hope that students will focus more on their school work, and we all understand that's what's most important, however I believe that by doing this, you would instead discouraging a considerable amount of students into believing that they are inferior to others. This new rule could seriously hurt others self esteem, and that seems very unfair.

I do believe, (though it makes me a bit uncomfortable to admit it) the final choice remains with you as it shall stay, I do advise you, even if iv given my opinion I strongly suggest you seek the advice of other staff members and how they see the issue, you may even go as far as asking the students them selves how they feel. With that being said, Sir, ask yourself, do you really want to make your students so miserable that they can't even complete the simplest of task? Or would you attempt to encourage that unfound skill with praise and care?

As you know, you are changing the school policy to students needing at least a B average to participate in school sports or activities. What you may not know is many students here have a C average.

A C average is not bad at all! It's actually the average scored of an A-F grade scoring. So many students do an expected ""good job"" on their grades. It is sometimes hard, or very hard for students to raise one grade level, especially since the school year is half way over, the sports and activities are winding down leaving no time to do so.

In addition, our middle school is very small, so we need all the people we can get on our sports team or activities. Making the cut-off a C average will cut off half of the participants from joining and already on a team or in a school activity!

This will create a difficult problem for coaches, and club leaders to have a small population on their team or in their club.

I have a friend who actually has a C average and is hoping to make the track team for the 3rd year in a row. She is also hoping that high school coaches watch her track meets to get on a team in high school, or even her favorite high school Springstead! If you change the rule she will not be able to participate in her favorite sport, or get into a further more educational and athletic school than her zoned high school Central, averaging a D grade level. Changing this rule can change someone's life.

To end this letter, my argument is to keep the rule of students to have at least a

C average grade to participate in school activities or sports in which many students have. I hope you have acknowledged this letter and change the rule.

AC8FB147E095,"To Mrs. Principal

I find this idea very smart, but yet unfair. A grade of a C is a average grade. People with a C average should be able to be on the team, but maybe just not play in the games. The students are on the team so they can be able to play in the games. So by not letting them play in the games, they will work hard to bring their average up. Maybe some type of motivation will help them like saying if you get your average up, you will get a week off homework .

Instead of kicking them off the team, give them a little leeway. Just make them sit the bench a couple games and then they will learn to work harder. One reason is because academics come before sports. The students will not have sports when it comes to real life. In order to get a job, you have to be well educated and ready. It doesn't matter how good of an athlete you are, sports won't be there all your life. Another reason is that if the student is trying his very best, you have to consider. The student may not be the brightest kid is the world, but if he is giving the best he can do, second think just kicking him off the team. Doing the best you can in everything is really all that matters. If you can do that, you are in good shape for everyday life.

So my idea to you is that you have to think about what you are doing. I'm not saying that a C average is good, but don't be that hard. Make the student have some more time maybe before practice to get his work done and study a little bit. That will help a lot. Because more than likely, he does not have that much time when he gets home to do homework, depending on the practice time. So that's my advice for you and i hope you use it wisely.

I would like to share my views on the new possible policy change requiring students to have at least a B average to participate in sports or other activities. I am partly against this policy change and partly for the change. The part of me for the policy to be changed can understand why you are doing this. I am going to assume it is because you want the students to do better in school by motivating them with higher requirements for there sports or other various school activities.

The other side of me that is saying not to go through with this policy change. The reason for me being against it is that I enjoy the activities sponsored by the school and I don't want to have to change myself academically to participate in these activities. The students who do not have the required B average would also not like this possibility. As I stated earlier, I do understand why this could be good thing motivating the students. But, it also has a chance to have a bad effect on the students education. If the students are so into their activities that they care more about said activities than their education they could be effected by the previously stated bad change. That bad change is the students dropping out. And I know that you, the principal and head of the school, do not want your students dropping out of school and ruining their education.

In conclusion, I agree with this about 50% and disagree about 50% with this double-edged sword of a policy change. The good side being motivating the students and the bad side being students dropping out of school. Thank you for your time reading this letter.

Dear principal you have made a new school policy that it is about any students that don't have a grade that its an B on each class they would not be able to participate on sports we the students have the right to play a sport with the grades of A,B,C

it is not fair for students that they just have a C average .And you don't let them play as i read the school district policy say that we all have the right to play on the sports but you are just not allowing that ,Please let us play on sports we all have the right to play that on the bill of right says that its rule number 1 teacher told us on social studies. We the students would promise you that we would behave this school year.

It is not fair for all of us and you don't have the right of canceling this if you don't change them we would go to the SCHOOL_NAME to tell them what's happening on this school .

If the problem is about that we are falling the class you could just told us about it and we would try to change are grade but you don't have the right to cancel the sport only if we aren't doing thing bad on it or hitting each other but we are not doing that .

I am very against your new policy for the new, B average policy for sports and activities.

I do not agree that students shouldn't be allowed to play in sports or join clubs if their average is below a B.

In previous years, the C average policy for sports and extra-curricular activities has worked. Those students had a higher risk of being kicked out of their program, but at least it gave them a fair chance. Besides, a C is the letter grade given to represent ""average.""

I have an A average, but I have still gotten below a B before and I certainly don't think that if I started a sport, and my grade suddenly went down to below a B average, that I should not be able to participate in it.

I know plenty of people who struggle with changes in the school year, and those stressful times can change how their grade comes out.

I also don't think that it would be fair to students who have kept their C average steady throughout the years, so that they could partake in the activities that they have always wanted to be in, because if you changed the policy, those students would be furious.

I'm sure that there are other students who are not going to support your new plan, including some of the students who have C averages.

I have thought about your idea of not letting students participate in sports or other activities. I am against this idea for these reasons: One, some students might not have the ability to get a ""B"" in a certain classes that they are not strong in. Two just because someone doesn't have the right grades, It doesn't mean that they should be taken out of the sports or activities they do. Lastly the students might be extremely good at a sport or passionate about the activity to do. Taking it away from them can lower their success in that field in the future.

I think it is unfair for students not being able to participate in activities if they do not maintain a ""B"" average. I think you should lower it to a ""C"". A student might be strong in a class like reading, but not good in math. If you take that student out for only grade in a class, then its unfair. Not all people are the same. Everyone has different abilities and fortes. You should keep it at a ""C"" average instead of ""B"".

Just because a child doesn't have a good grade in their class doesn't mean you should take them out of the activities and sports they do. Students need their activities and sports for different reasons. Some people use their activity or sports to vent out stress and anger.

They use it to release their feelings and not to keep things bottled up on the inside. If you take their activities away from them, then you'll see many un happy and angry students wandering the halls and skipping classes. Students need their own ""escape"". Something that can keep their minds off of things. Something that will keep them away from drugs, gangs and violence. I know that students that will not be able to maintain that ""B"" average will resort to activities like these.

Taking away a students activities, because of grades is like a double sided knife. It could: A. help them focus on their grades and become more successful. Or B. lower their success for that field in the future. Even though It's important to maintain good grades, I also believe more strongly in people doing what they are passionate about in the future. Cutting them off from their activities won't hinder them from pursuing the jobs that they are passionate about. Some kids want to become famous in acting, art, or sports. Kicking children out of these activities and making them focus more on academics could break their dreams of becoming what they want to be.

So, before you make up your decision about chancing the policy from maintaining a ""C"" average to ""B"" average, Please review my letter and take the time to think about how this could affect the students future. Take my letter into consideration. Thank you!

I have noticed that you are deciding to change the schools sport policy. I think that you shouldn't do that. Consider the fact that some people do better in school by participating in sports. It helps the students work as a team.

Some people to sports because their parents make them. Others do it for the love of the sport. How would you feel if some one took away something that you loved just cause your not getting a B average? I'm thinking not very happy. Also, many parents might get mad at you for doing that. It's the parents job to decide if the student should stop doing sports or not, if it's affecting their grades.

Doing sports also helps students with teamwork. In school teachers are always looking for new ways to help students work as a team. If you are doing sports or other activities you need to work as a team to win or to finish the job. So students use their skills that they learn by doing sports to how they work with others in school.

If you decide to only let students with a B average play on sports teams then you would encourage students to do better in school, and also teach them that they should do the best that they can also that their grades shouldn't be lower that a B average. People with a low average should be rewarded doing things that they like to do because then they will think its okay to have low grades because no matter what your going to let them play on the sports teams. That should be a reward to play on the sports team.

Also kids would try harder to in school if you only let B average students play.

You will encourage students to do better by not letting them get away will bad grades and being able to play on a sports team. You would also encourage them by showing them responsibility on doing their work and trying their best to succeed in school. That's really important too. So you'll have more students with a high average then low because most students in school like to play sports and some will do just about anything to be on the teach.

You should reward students for having bad grades and if you let low average students play sports then you'll show them that no matter they do they will get away with not doing work or trying their best. In sports you have to try your best to win in school it's the same because you have to try your best to get the grades you deserve. If you reward students with low grades doing sports then they aren't trying their best or getting the grade they deserve.

You'll have more students with a good grade then you will with a bad grade because if you reward students with good grades then you'll get more students wanting to get better in school then you will if you just let students with bad grades play sports.

I hope you that you will see that it would be better if you let students with a B average play because then your going to have students want to do better so they can play sports in school.

From a teachers point of view, I completely agree with you and your policy. Many students here would do anything to be on a sports team and I think this will raise many peoples grades up and will make our school better. Although from a students perspective, nearly 90% of the students here have a C as there average grade. I honestly think that you should consider having the average grade to be a C because some students are doing everything they can and doing the best that they can and only coming up with a C. As a student, I know how other students feel and what they go through. Since your the principal students are often intimidated by you and don't feel comfortable talking to you about what goes on behind closed doors. For some unfortunate students, all they have to make them feel like there actually something is sports. They have many different emotions building inside them and they've got to let it out somehow without getting in trouble and they usually let all there emotions out in sports. Sports is some peoples passion or in other words there ""get away."" For me tumbling is my passion and i know when I go out there and do flips and other things it feels as if the world around me has disappeared. It's the best feeling in the world and I would hate for them to miss out on this just because there passing grade isn't good enough. Life is harder then others for some students here and they usually come from a bad home life and the best they can do in situations like that is a C grade which is still a passing grade. Please give these students a chance to do one thing in their life that they enjoy, let them have a ""get away"" so they won't take there anger out on other things like other students or themselves. I know you would like all of us to have an A or B but the honest truth is all of us are gifted in different areas. I think you should let these students have a chance to do what they love and if there grades aren't suitable for you then get them a tutor or take any other route then just not letting them play at all. There's always a better road or route to take, you just have to find it. Listen to your students TEACHER_NAME. It will make an effective difference on how you think or look at things.

If you can not play sports and keep up your grade then i don't think you should be able to play. I think it should be the rule"" NO PASS NO PLAY""

It would be like this for an example if i was the best football player on the team but i cant keep up my grades well until my grades get pulled up i should be pulled from that class and put in one to help pull up my grades then put back onto that team.

I believe you are requiring kids to have a B average to play sports in school, and i believe that most students have C averages. I must have to say that I disagree because i believe C grades are in the 70 averages and its still passing and good enough. If it was 65 or lower the grade needs improvement and those people who have 65 and lower should not play because it might cause distraction to themselves and work. A, B, and C averages deserve to play because those grades look good on your report card.

An A average is excellent. A B average is great. A C average is good. Anything under 65 needs improvement. That's how i believe its suppose to work in able to play sports on actual teams. I also think that if you are in the 60's, in order to play on a team you have to have great behavior and at least try to pass because maybe you are trying hard enough but you just can't get to the point of A, B, and C averages.

It's not fair just for people to have a B average because other people deserve to play and there have to be a limit.

I, STUDENT_NAME an eighth graders of SCHOOL_NAME has heard of your considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless we have a B grade average. What you don't know is that many of us students have a C grade average. my point is that your changing our school policy might be unfair. Why, you might ask? there are many reasons why.

TEACHER_NAME, if you were to change the school policy it might be difficult to maintain a B grade average because some of us students might have difficulties in one class and might need a little help in one lesson that they didn't understand. but that isn't a real reason to kick a person off the team, that is really unfair because maybe the sport or activity is what the person has passion for. Its like trying to take a bottle away from a baby when its hungry. I myself am very passionate about soccer, soccer is an active and painful sport but its what i love doing, just feel that rush of adrenaline run through your veins and being able to say ""I wona gold metal because I was in the forward."" Every person wants to complete this phrase

""I'm proud of myself because ...""

Another reason why you shouldn't change the school policy is because doing sports isn't something you do to be active or to have fun. One does it because of the benefits that come from sports.

I have heard about your plan to change the school's policy on grade point average and how it affects a student's extracurricular activities. I personally believe that a 'B' average is to high and believe that the current 'C' average should stay in place.

I know many students who have a 'C' average because the did poorly on one or two tests over concepts they did not grasp or students who have hit a rough patch. I do not believe that the school should punish someone who simply did not grasp a concept or had a hard time with a lesson. Everyone faces that challenge, it just effects students differently.

In addition to that on our grading scale a 'C' is listed as ""average"".

The ""average"" student is indeed involved in extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs, ""average"" students hit that rough patch mentioned above, ""average"" students still give class there all and work hard to try to no longer be ""average"".

I also have a question to ask about your new policy.

What if a student who is currently on a team start to achieve an 'C' average, who is to be monitoring that. Is it the coach or sponsor, the teachers, you- the principal, is the student supposed to take that responsibility of coming forth and suspending or evening expelling him/her from the team or club they are involved in?

I bring this point forward because in each of these situations it is unfair or time consuming for the man or women in question. If the team coach or club sponsor checks grades then its is time consuming for them, most school coaches and sponsors being teachers themselves would not want to take another hour out of their day to check grades of each member/player. If the teachers of these students monitor their grades they also come at the time consuming element of it along with the fact that it is not the teachers responsibility to check up on the student and his/her outside-of-school life. If you are going to be screening grades ma'am you already are very busy and I could not find you having the time to screen all the club members and players at our school to see if they made the grade. The only option left is the student.

I know this places great responsibility on him or her to do there very best in class, but what about a boy on the basketball team who gives math class his all but cant seem to pass that one test, knows he is going to be kicked off the team, made fun of and questioned on why he was kicked off and now upset and hurt by the torment of strangers along with his friends.

This are just a few things to think about when making your decision on the school's policy on grade point average and how it affects a student's extracurricular activities. Though, as you see here, there a lot against it.

0B14040A5B27,"Many kids think it's ok when having a grade C average. I'm not saying having a C is a bad thing, It's just that kids can work a little harder to get what they deserve. I think it's not such a bad idea to change the required average from C to B. It would encourage kids to get better grades, do more with their lives, and be more responsible. I don't think the kids' parents would want their child getting nothing but C' s!

When students love, and want to play sports, and hear, ""You must have a C grade average"" , that makes them think they don't have to work hard in school. Getting a C is way easier then getting a B, all you have to do is not do your work. That has always been easy for kid to do. Unfortunately, sports isn't everything. There's a lot more stuff to be good at, like being smart. To play college or professional sports, you still have to go through school to make it to that point of college.

Kids just think, ""Well I'm just going to play this sport all my life, and make money off of that."" Either you have to retire, or get injured, you'll need a plan B. If you're not used to doing your work and making good grades, what else are you going to do? If you're not in sports anymore you'll have to do something else, either a singer or business man. Both of those require going to school and working hard, and if you're not able to do so, the rest of life will seem extremely hard.

I also think, that by raising the required average, it would make the kids more responsible. It can get a little tough keeping up with your work sometimes, especially when you start to get more than one class. So having a B average gives them a sense of responsibility. That will also help them in life. Being responsible, and making good decisions can change peoples' lives for the better, have a wonderful life style.

To sum this argument up, it's not bad to have a C average, but it's also not great. Having a C average all the time might not get you anywhere in life. You won't have high paying celery, you won't get the home you've always wanted, and it might be harder to pay the bills you're going to get.

Our schools practically revolve around our work, our sports, and our other activities. We are all on the same team no matter who you root for, it's still what we enjoy doing.

If you had to have the grade average of a B to play in any activities, i don't know what would happen. Maybe it could help people bring their grades up, or maybe it wouldn't. You never know til you try something, so it's always hard just to guess. I would go against the grade average being moved up, because I don't think it would really help. Sports or activities are always your choice, whether you want to play or not. Whether you should shoot, kick, jump, tackle, or just close your eyes. It's your choice, and no one else can change that for you.

I also think that if they moved it up, many people would just stop playing. If you don't understand a school subject, and yet you can still pass I think that it's okay. I mean, yes you would want to be able to understand things a whole lot better, but if they're not going to help you in the future what's the point? Getting good grades is a fantastic thing, but if you really want something it all comes down to you. It's your choice to follow your heart and do what you want to do, or to do what's best for you.

Whether you're for, or against something it's still your choice to do what you want. Making choices can be tough, but you can always try to find something out. That's why I would be against moving the grade average up to a B. I believe that it could be a good thing, or a bad thing but you'll never know til you try.

Many of the students, including myself, feel that you should allow students with a C average to participate in sports. Because many of the athletes on the teams have only a C average. Now some of them might have higher scores but the ones who don't shouldn't be kicked out of the activities they like. Some students are not as smart academically as they are good physically. But we the students feel that as long as they are smart enough to get a C average than they should be allowed to participate in sports. If you approve the new policy, odds are we wont have any sports teams anymore and the ones we do have will be very small. Our teams are mostly made up of C average students.

I feel the reason that is, is because many of the smarter students are more interested in science, history, reading, etc. That may not be the case for everyone but for the most part it is true. If you were to pass the policy there would be a huge outrage within the student body system. And many of the athletes that are C average, would go to other places to play sports. And I know from personal experience that it costs money to partake in sports. You must pay for the jerseys and the coach and ref fees. So if you made that policy then the school would be losing money.

Although those two reasons are fairly good reasons I think, there is another reason that I feel is the best reason of all. My main reason for going against this policy is, think about the students. Most of them do not like school and that is why they are getting a C average. And participating in sports makes them actually want to go to school so they can enjoy the sports. And if you stop allowing the C average kids in sports, then all of those kids will lose all interest is school. They will stop caring and trying. I feel that as a principal it is your job to want the best for our kids. And that in turn means that you want them to try their hardest and do well. But if you take away their reason to try, they will take away the effort. It may cost more, or be harder to let all the students in, but I feel and you should hopefully feel that the cost is worth it if it gives the kids hope, fun, and a reason to try.

That alone is enough of a reason I feel, not to put that new policy into action. But if you feel that those reasons aren't good enough, then put that new policy into action and then look at the student's grades and efforts at school. And then you can see how they would probably have dropped tremendously. Because they have to reason to try if they get nothing good or fun out of it. And you can also look at all of our past trophies and awards and think about how we won't get many more because all of our good players got kicked off. So if you decide to pass it, I hope you can work the other problems that come from it out, and if you decide, to listen to this advice and take this all into consideration, and decide not to pass it. Then I can almost guarantee that our football teams, track teams, baseball teams, basketball, softball, lacrosse, water polo, and soccer teams will all thank you for it. Because you give them reasons to try in school. Which also means they'll try during a game.

Which will bring our school honor, respect, dignity, and most importantly it will bring us closer together as a group. So we can all stop arguing and fighting and help improve our schools, communties, towns, and cities.

I hope I have given you some things to think about. Thank you for your time. I hope this helps you make the right decision.

Almost no one has a B average so i think its not fair that those who want to play outside sports can't i think it should be based on if there even trying at school not how their grade is. That's stripping kids of their right to do what the want with their lives what if some kids don't want to go home to their parents what if they had nothing else to do what would you think of that or would it be the same kids do what you think is right but might no be what you thought? One day kids will revolt over that and it might not be so pretty and innocent.

We're not as stupid as you think we just need a good influence to inspire us to do better and obviously if we haven't done it yet then we haven't found the right influence yet. I think what your doing to the sports issue at school is wrong and your opinion of it is invalid to me. But that might just be to me imp not sure about the other students but i think all of our opinions on this are close to the same and just as valid as vote for the president to me.

B74852381DC0,"Dear Principal,

I would just like to say that I think what you plan on doing to the sports and other activities isn't fair to students. Students should be able to participate in any sport or activities if they have a passing grade, and a C average is on that grade scale. Most people who are in sports these days don't have a B average, they have a C average.

And if you close it off for any students that have lower than a B average you would losing most of your players. Unless it's your goal, to lose all of the schools sports players and activities participator's. And I don't think it is, or I hope it's not.

This school is based off of the sports teams and the grades, but without a sports team the school would go down in education. Not only will students stop trying to get good grades but there parents would start getting mad about their kids not being able to participate in any sports or activities. Yeah I mean if you want to mess up the school's education than that's up to you, but your only ruining things for the students and the school. And most students come to this school because of the sports teams.

So if you limit it for other people than those people would want to go to a different school, and trust me you would lose a bunch of people. And most people don't want to leave this school because they like it the way it is now and changing it wouldn't help make it a better place to learn. So all I'm really saying is that if you change the grade average to a B you would be losing a lot of things and students. I just hope that you see this letter as a guide for you to make the right decision and not make the wrong one when it comes time to decide. Thank you for your time.

I heard you are considering changing the schools policy so that the students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I think that's crazy! If kids don't have and opportunity to play a sport because of their ""C"" that's no reason to take away their dream. What if they want to become a professional swimmer? You're just going cut down their dream tree just because of a ""c'?

I have a ""C"" in math, and swim is coming up-you're just going to take away my chances to beat my times from last year? I could grow up and become something amazing and thank you one day for the opportunity of being able to swim, but now you have taken my-and other swimmers ""the ride away"". I am appalled.

I know if you do intend to proceed in changing the policy we students will try to get better grades to play the sport, but not every kid has a GPA of 4.0. So their for i propose my idea to keep the policy that you just have to have a 2.0! Seriously, as my 6th grade teacher told me, ""something is better than nothing"". Sure you want us to have good grades but us kids,(teens) want to be involved in school activities but with or with out good grades i think if they strive hard enough they deserve the right to be involved.

BEEC3F8E676F,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I, for one, disagree with this statement. i find it unfair for a student to have a grade B average. i can understand C average but a B is hard to keep for some students, once you have gone up to one, or down to one. Mostly the students have

C averages and i think that with this going on, there will be no soccer tem, or football team or basketball team, or volleyball team.

i understand that maybe an upside to this whole statement is to probably motivate students to try harder to be able to have a privilege of being on that basketball team or that football team or that volleyball team.

But sir, what you do exceed of thinking is that what if young RELATIVE_NAME had an A plus in science and he forgot to study for the chemistry test on Friday, and little did he know that exact test was worth 50% of his grade? RELATIVE_NAME failed that test, and ended up having a c in science, giving him a C grade average. RELATIVE_NAME love football and he wanted a scholar ship, but never got because he didn't go to the finals with the rest of the team, simply because he missed one particular test.

Once you down from an A to a B, you try to figure out what was wrong and you try to work on it, but what if nothing was worth as much as what you missed? what if one 50% test was equal to three more of those tests? Going up from a C to a B is exciting, but you're trying to keep up the good work. once you do, you can't get overly exited, or else you might feel a little over whelmed and get a little ""big headed"" and mess up on the whole thing you had going for a while.

A sport should not be handled as a privilege, it she handled as a recommendation. because kids can always go to a public team and try out there. that's just making the team here at school seem more ""exclusive"" which is basically pointless.

Another hypothetical question, sir; What if little RELATIVE_NAME, has okay grades, but no social skills? Isn't that what sports are all about? social skills, working together, and exercise. Those are the three magic words to get into a great high school.

It has come to my attention that you are contemplating whether or not to remove sports or other activities from the school unless students maintain a B or higher in classes. There are many reasons as to why you shouldn't do this. Some of which include social involvement, it is a good source of physical activity, and lastly because not all students are above average for meeting grades higher than C.

One of the most important reasons on why removing sports form the students that don't make B' s or higher is because it is a good source of physical activity. As you have probably heard childhood obesity has become a major issue in the United States and removing more time away from children to play and exercise would cause them to gain more weight.

Another important reason why you shouldn't remove sports from those who don't make B' s or higher is because it a good way to socialize with his or her peers. being on the football team gives me many chances that others may not have. I have always gotten good grades in all my classes with an occasional C but there is no need to take away my social involvement with my friends over it. Almost any and every job there is requires social skills that i will need to succeed in life and where else to get it than in sports?

The final and last reason on why you should have sports be available to those who make C' s is because C is the average grade. teachers always tell you to make B' s or A' s but that's only because they want you to exceed. They want to see that you can make grades higher than the average student and be successful. If a student is challenged academically in school and pushes barely to pass there is no need to have him exceed.

In conclusion there are three major reasons on why eliminating sports for those students who do not make B' s or higher should still be able to participate in sports and other activities. Those are the three reasons i can think of that would have the biggest negative impact on your decision. Thank you for listening to me and i hope you have taken my ideas and what i have said here in consideration.

ECBF33747F9F,"The New Policy Change That Can Benefit All.

I think that the policy change is a great idea. The students need to have something to motivate them to do their school work and get good grades. Sports are the perfect motivation. Students are very serious about their athletic ability. Some students only think about the special sport they play, and live only to play it. They need the motivation to do their school work and study for assessments, and the way to do that is to tell them if they get anything lower than a B average, then they wont be able to play on their sports team(s).

Discipline is the way to go when it comes to schoolwork. The students need to be told what to do, otherwise, they think they do whatever they want, be lazy, and not care about their schoolwork. Yes, it is great to do sports and to be active, but school always comes first. At least, that's what my dad always said.

Some students just don't understand the point in school, and why it's so important in your life. They don't know that your grades now effect your chances to get into the college you want, or the high school you want. School is to get you ready for your life career of your choice. Your career effects your life; your pay, the things you want to buy, the things you need to buy, activities, and more. I think students just need to understand that school now effects everything in your life, and you always have to try your best. Even if you have a bad teacher, or a good teacher, you need to make it work for yourself, and study hard every night, the way that's best for you. I'm not saying you have to do school work 24/7. You need to have fun too, you have to have some kind of balance. But always, school work is first.

Sports aren't as important as school, so I think if the students aren't up to working hard in order to play the sport they love, then that's alright. They don't need sports. They can for sure live without sports. What you can't live without, is a good education.

E7988483480F,"Dear Principle,

I do not think the idea of students who don't have a B average not being able to play sports is fair.

Some students don't do well because of a certain problem or disability that they have.

Also, many kids are overweight or have nothing to do in the afternoons when they get home from school and most kids' parents' work in the afternoons so sports are usually a really good extra curricular activity to have to keep them busy.

Also when colleges are looking at student's applications they look for extra curricular activities along with good grades. If a student makes very good grades and also does sports and other activities then the college would most likely choose them instead of a student whose grades are not good and that student doesn't have any sports or activities. Taking away sport opportunities for students with lower grades would lower the amount of students going to college and being successful in life.

Hello, I am writing this letter to you today just to give you my perspective on your new policy of who should and shouldn't be able to try out and play school sports.

I can completely relate to where you are coming from.

And I can somewhat relate to what you are talking about.

The only problem I have with that idea is that I feel that some students will feel bad for being left out even though a C is average.

I also think that there should be no way to be knocked out of track.

I say this because everyone is always talking and thinking about obesity.

This is not like football or basketball or any other sports like that.

The reason being is that the main reason people run track is either to lose weight or to get fit.

I know what you are thinking.

you are thinking, why can't they run on their own.

It takes a lot of motivation to get out and run on your own.

I know this because I run a good bit.

It was a lot harder to get myself going, mentally and physically when I started than it is to now.

Now, back to the subject of which I was writing you earlier.

I am going to have to say that with any passing grade I personally think you should be able to play any school sports.

If you do not do this then lots of kids who just don't want to try harder in school will just say, ""the heck with it"" and never even give it a second thought.

I also think that there are a lot of athletes out there and don't always try their hardest.

Dear Mrs. Principal,

As a student maim i think, maybe your idea to make students have an average of B' s only would be a good idea for students to try harder to increase they're grades, but once you think about it twice maim some students have C 's because that is all they can give. Sometimes its not because they didn't study or because they were watching television but because sometimes we get so nervous that rush through the answers or even forget everything we have been studying super hard to succeed. Like I said before I believe not everyone can have an average of B 's but a C is already a passing grade. No one is perfect we all have a couple of mistakes sometimes. Either way if you do all B 's probably the whole school may not participate in any school activity. Now that is the why we shouldn't change it. We should change it though cause it might pressure the students to get higher grades to participate in a sport. The school may also have a higher percent of students passing and less students failing... Which would help the school get a higher score at the end of the year.

I believe that either way has its up's and down's nobody's perfect and we all deserve different opportunity's at least once. If you ask me I would recommend you maim to leave it the way it is. That way you will keep students in sports instead of gangs, drugs, alcohol or other bad situations that would leave the school with a bad reputation and the students with a bad life... My advice is that we leave things the way they are and keep on pressuring the students to a successful life and a life filled with happiness and joy. That would help increase they're style of learning and being successful in what ever the student decides to be. Sports are a way to keep students on track of school and trying they're best not to get into trouble so that they may stay playing the sport without having to quit or having to give up they're sport because of grades. I hope you make a decision fast that may work out right for the school and for the students.

I have choose to write you a letter about why we should have school sports. Well first off you said ""That you are considering to change school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless the have at least B average"". well personally you can do any sports with a GPA of 2.5. i would think that would be fair because you should know that many people are not that smart at school but really good in sports. So now i say that you should base it on a group class so in their view class you have them take a test. and in that test you say"" okay this test is to see how well you do. so lets just say that there is only a couple of kids who well don't very well then you say okay since a couple of you didn't do very this is what we are going to do we are going to combine all the kids test so all 30 test and we are going to average them. Which mean every body has a good chance and then if that doesn't work. than that is when that hard parts come. so what you do then is say if you really want to do this sport than you have to work for. that means after school you have to work on that class. and get help find some one or a book that can help you. So that way you can have some good grades. So then lets just say that you do that every day. And you make it on the team. then what its going to be practice every day for the team. take the skills you learn form your after school help and use them .so that way you can go home take a shower and go study for that big test you have. but really it should be actually a C because C is average. and B is above average. so if you have a B then you should but if you have a C then you should work as hard as you can to get a B so that way you can play safe and have fun well doing what you love the most working hard and choosing the best way to success.

Well i guess you should say ""what about P.E. well i guess if you have P.E. then you should have sports to. because P.E. is like a sport to. you run you do all these kinds of work out and it is just like sports. so in other words P.E. is just like sports.

I am not here to argue with you but I do not agree with you that there should be a policy change that you have to have a B average to play a sport. Sports and grades are two totally different things in my opinion. Kids are already having a hard time getting a C average just to play a sport. Even some kids can't get a C average to play a sport so they can't do it. I think it's ridiculous that you have to have a certain grade average to play a sport. Sports are a activity; not getting homework in on time or studying for a test. Those are two totally different topics to me.

If you changed the school policy so that you have to have a B average to participate in school activities or school sports you wouldn't have as many kids in sports or you might even have kids moving to other schools. Kids would defiantly try harder to get their grades up but teachers may not understand how hard it is to do those kind of things. Changing the school policy so that you have to have a B average is not understandable to me. Other students may not agree with me or you may not agree with me but people that want to play sports will agree with me 100%.

Like I've said before, school grades and sports are not the same thing in my opinion. Sports are handling a challenge with another team or learning how to play the sport and grades are understanding life and the history of everything. Learning how to write stories and learning how to handle a ball are two totally different things.

Dear Principal,

I think the idea of allowing students to have at least a B average is a good idea because many students tend to focus on just their sports, they may tend to have very bad grades, and wont qualify to pass the grade their in.

If we allow students to have a B average, students would focus more on their school work, because they would want to play their sports.

In order for them to play, they would have to focus more, thus giving better grades.

Secondly, students would tend to have bad grades because of sports.

If we set it for a B average, more kids would have to work harder for their grades because they want to play. Therefore students wont have bad grades.

Making it a B average can be an encourager towards students.

Lastly, if students are only making a C average, there's a small chance that the students will pass. If we make it where the grades must be a B average, students will improve their school work, making them have better grades.

Well thank you for your time and consideration. I hope you tend to see why changing the grading average for sports is necessary.

Remember though, students tend to focus on just their sports, they may tend to have very bad grades, and wont qualify to pass the grade their in.

My name is STUDENT_NAME other student's and myself have been not so happy with your decision on having at least a grade B average to play sports. Myself and a lot other student's average grade is a C. I think that is not the best idea for the eligible grade for sports. Students such as me need something to work for or to keep their grade up. Studies show that when a person is in a school sport, that the person wants to be in it makes the person work their hardest and get the best grades they can get. If you keep a chart and mark the grade down that people have in sports you will notice that it is high. But if you keep track of that person when their not on sports you will see their grade might be low. So if you let the grade average be a C for eligibility on sports it will give more students a chance of getting in that sport and keeping a high grade for that season.

In regards to the change in rules, which state that students must maintain a B average to be able to participate in sports or other activities, I agree with you 100%! Enforcing this law will help to push the students to keep up their grades. School was made for kids to learn and if they decide to slack off for sports I believe they should not be handed the privilege of such activities. If they would like to be in these activities well then they should try to keep a focus on school and then be given the privilege.

Maintaining a B average should not be so difficult for students, with a little effort and concentration anything can be accomplished. In addition, I would think that this rule would make students want to try harder in school and be able to achieve a B or higher grade average. For example, if a C average student would like to participate in a specific sport then he/she will have to give more effort to getting a B average and being given the ability to participate in this specific sport. I believe this rule will help many students to achieve educational goals and put their knowledge to the test.

Lastly, I agree with the rule that is now being enforced and I believe it will help the school's students to participate and concentrate more in class. This rule will teach students that being able to participate in sports and other school activities is a privilege and to earn a privilege they must work hard. I believe this was a well thought out rule and should be enforced in other schools as well. This rule will help the school and its students to get a better feeling for privileges and the way to earn them.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

All the teachers need to do is help more to get these kids to pass and maybe they can make something out of sports and they will come back later on in life and thank you for pushing them to pass school to be where they are right now.,2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

I do not like the new school policy that you are proposing. Their are many reasons why, and I am glad to state them.

First of all, if most of your students have a grade C average, then they will not be able to play the sports or participate in the activities and you might not have enough students in your teams to play against other schools.

Secondly I understand that you think that if you change the school policy, then most of your students, at least the ones in sports and activities, will have a higher average, but what you didn't think about was that some of your students are trying their hardest and are only achieving a grade C average. It would be unfair to pull out that student from his/her sport or activity just because he/she is having a hard time in class.

I also believe that, you will be denying the collage education of some of these students that have a grade C average and are in a sport or in another activity. Those students that would have gone to collage due to their talents with sports or whatever activity that they were in, might not be able to go because of this new policy. You might be denying hundreds of students collage education just because of a school policy!!

Having a grade C average means that you understand it, your just not good at it. These students understand what the teacher is talking about, but they are just not good at it!

Thank you for taking your time to read my letter and I hope you take more time thinking about changing the school policy.

dear, TEACHER_NAME

I believe that this is not a fair rule because not everyone is naturally smart like others they might have a tougher time passing. This could make it tough to maintain a B average as well as staying focused on school. If the grade limit is this high kids might loose focus during sports. If the grade is to low kids wont focus enough and fall behind in their studies. This is why i believe that a C average is good because it is a neutral grade meaning that its not to low or high. If we can keep it at C average i also believe that lather than stay at a bare minimum. all in all this statement of raising grades is an important topic that could affect the future of many children's futures . I just believe that C average is the best answer to the problem that is at hand.

I don't think that making students that are having C averages not compete in sports is not very fair. You might say ""why""?

Well in my opinion i think they should still be aloud to.

Because i have suffered with C s and have been is basketball and track.

I mean we try hard enough just to make a C s! if you did do that i don't think you would have many kids in athletes. Why? Because its hard to just pass with a B or a A.

So we try to make a C that way we still pass.

Okay so what if the best player got a 76 on a test well its still passing, but no he cant play. i think he would be very disappointed. he studded the test very hard and he still douse not get to play.

So lets take another person in to considerations. There is this young boy his name is RELATIVE_NAME and he loves football! He is quterback and the team needs him to win

Friday Nights Game. its Tuesday and he has been studding for this big math quiz on Thursday.

finely the Thursdays comes around he take the test and he passes with a 74. But man he cant play because you made the rule were you have to make a 80 or above.

Well you just made that team lose there game but if you had not made that rule he could have played and won the game.

In conclusions think you should keep the passing grades for sports the same way it has all way been. Please Just take my paper in to consideration.

0A2A6855DE4F,"Sports have been a big part of school for as long as we all know of. Do you believe it's a good policy to remove those with failing grades off of their sport's team? Having to change a policy a such as removing students with below a B grade average is a important thing to do especially if your player is not doing so great education wise. It can help them pick up their grades. It is also a good consequence to show that without good grades, you are not allowed to play.

The policy of removing those with low grade average off their sports team is a good idea, because it helps your student stay on track and pick up their grades. Being excused from a sport event due to grades, can show the student that he or she needs to spend less time practicing with the team and more time getting better grades. I, being a sports player, know that without grades, I cannot play a game or attend practice. This gives you time to make up missing assignments, get extra credit, get a better grade, and continue doing that sport you like to do.

This policy is also good because you need to give consequences to those who do not do well in school. Yes, getting in trouble with coach is bad, but school is important. Without a great education, the chances of becoming a professional athlete become very slim. You need grades, and good practice to make you a great player and a great student.

Having good grades, reminds me that I can create a better future, and not worry about being excused from my team.

Many of you may agree with my opinion about this policy, but I know some of you may have some concerns. Maybe one of these concerns is that your student won't proceed with getting good grades. Well the solution to that is simple, no grades, no play. I understand, as a athlete myself, having to be excused due to grades is bad and can get me a little upset. But I know, without my grades, I won't be allowed back on the team.

So as you can see having a policy such as this one is good for the school, and your students. It helps them get back on track. It is also good consequence for those that don't get good grades.

My name is, STUDENT_NAME. I am in the 8th grade at your school. The new policies you have created are kind of outrageous to me and other students attending your school. I run track and have a lot of friends that play many different sports. Most of us aren't making the grades that meet the standards of your policy. So i am writing a letter to you to ask you to please remove the policy.

I know you are going to tell me that you are very upset with most of the students grades, but a lot of us are trying. School and home can get very stressful, And when I have a stressful day or one of my friends do. We all like to come to our practices or something to help get it off our minds. Sports help a lot of us to relax and think clearly. Mostly to get stuff off our minds.

I pay more attention to my school work than I do sports. I always complete my homework and have it turned in on time. Its just the new policies you have made are keeping me from doing what I love. Its hurting a lot of the students too. It breaks my heart that i don't get to go to the track meets anymore, due to my grades. So now I just go home and do nothing, And who wants to go home and just do nothing ? Not this guy! Sports are like a getaway for a lot of students, And now most of us do not have that anymore. The new policies probably will start affecting my grades more than ever before.

So I'm asking you if you would please put the new policies on a low or you know you could just remove them. I'm very stressed from school and home. I have no relief anymore. But I'm not Speaking out just for myself. I'm talking and speaking out for every student in the school that feels the same way. So if you could please remove the policies I will get better.

I do not believe that it is right to restrict what sport a student plays just because there average grade is not a B what if a student is having trouble in class and not understanding the work. making them quit the team will solve nothing just cause more problems. It will make them fe if a student wants to go to collage but does not have the grades or the money but they are good enough at sports to get an athletic scholarship then why shouldn't they. but with this policy a student my be left with nothing because they did not have the grades to get on the team even thought they are passing all of there class's.

i think that this policy is not fear to all the people on a school team. A good player that likes the team and wants to be a part of it is taken of just because they do not have a B average. while a player that does not really want to be on the team and does not try his hardest is left on the team just because he qualifies for the grades.

I agree that it would be a great idea to only allow the B average or higher to participate in sports. It wouldn't be fair to reward the students who don't try in school and don't care if they do bad. Even if there are students who do try, it would give them a good opportunity to try and do better. There would be much more students working hard and getting better grades. It would be a much better chance to see what our school is really capable of. Parents and teachers would be very proud and students would feel confident. This would be a good way in showing how much the students improved. Lots, of students are lacking off and not paying attention from marking period to marking period. Having this new rule would be A goal to reach for every student who wants to join a sport. If more kids do good, friends of their's might try and do good as well. Every body will know that the students on sports have good grades and they would be like roll models to every one else. I know that this would be a great idea and that students would do much better in almost everything when they grow up.

I think i speak for all people when I say, ""I LOVE SPORTS"" and its never going to change, but I honestly think you can't play or participate in sports unless you have the grades, and so do most kids, but there are kids that dwell and need sports to get around and have the confidence of being a kid, that don't always have the grades to say that.

In my life I probably wouldn't be the person I am today without having sports, because they have got me to achieve so many things that I probably couldn't achieve on a regular day basis. Like I said before though, you have to have the grades to do it. Me, trying to be an ""A"" student and having the grades that can get me through school and being a well-mannered boy, having the least grade you can get to keep participating at a ""B"" isn't so bad, but you have to think about the whole student body. Not all kids have the grades they want, or even the grades they need to succeed. The average grade of the student body is a ""C"" which quite frankly could involve most of the athletes that are great and amazing at sports to get kicked off the team, and I'm not trying to say they should get off the hook, and be barely passing a class, but that the lowest standards of a principal may not fit the lowest standards for some of our students.

Also you have to think of the students lives back at home. Many kids have parents, that thinking a ""C"" is good enough or just fine. So you pushing them to have a ""B"", may disrupt their thinking process and they may complain that they may not have the brains of other kids and the thought progression of the other kids in the class that are having no problem completing their grade average of a ""B"", so there is some things that must be changed.

So, my idea for having as many kids on the team possible in terms of keeping them good in grades, is to change the requirements of having a ""B"" change to having a ""C+"", but have the coach keep on his players that the student can do much better and have him report his grade every week to the coach and have the coach watch the students progress in school, and most kids may argue that they cannot keep that average, well then they need to change some of their working habits and become the kid they want to be.

I think that you shouldn't change the schools policy about having at least a B average because some people are not good at taking test or they forgot to do their homework. It should be at least a C average because most people would have a C average on their report card. because some where out their in ocean of students their is some one who is really good at sports but has only a C average.

If you want to have more people in the sports then you are going to have to keep the grade the same and not change it. If you want more people to be healthy then you are going to have to lower your standards. There will be people that are going to want to make the grades just to do some thing they like or to get in fit for the beach. I know I would because no one wants to be wherein a bikini or swim trunk when they are chubby. You are going to have to not change the grade standards and keep it the same but making the grades when you just be having fun or working out just doing of those things are good because then everyone will be healthy.

They may be overwhelmed in this decision and may think they are not good enough to do anything. That leads to problems out of school, those kids may get into more trouble, because if you are not involved in any after school activities many kids get bored. So if you are occupied after school you stay out of harm and so do the people around you.

You also improve as a person by being involved in after school activities. You get social skills and have an increase in friends which is great for improving on your confidence . So you will be a confident person by feeling important by being apart of something and your grades shouldn't stand in your way of that.

If your grade is lower than a C, than I don't think you should be aloud to participate an after school activities, because if you are not trying you shouldn't be rewarded by having fun. But I and other students strongly agree that having to have at least a B is a bit harsh, a C is not a bad thing and should not be held against anyone, in their decisions to improve their lifestyles, by taking part in activities after the school day.

So I and my other of my fellow students agree that you shouldn't have to have a B average to participate in any after school activity, but you should have at least grades that are C'S and higher.

I believe that students should not have a B average to compete in sports or other activities.

A reason is since many of the students have a grade C average, it could be hard for them to catch up. Another reason is that the activities are there so the students could have fun.

Lastly a reason is that the students without a grade B average could feel left out.

A reason why the students should not have a B average to compete is that since most students have a grade C average it could be hard for them to catch up.

It could be even harder if they are not good at the subject.

So if there is mostly everyone in school with a grade C average. then there will be less people in the sports and other activities.

But I think the principal wants more people in the sports and other things.

Another reason why the students should not have a grade B average is because the sports and activities are there so the students could have fun.

But if a lot of students do not have a grade B average not a lot of people will go.

So the principal will not like that either.

If the students do not have fun they might not even come after school.

So there might to even be a sports team.

Lastly a reason is that the students without a grade B average could feel left out.

They might not like it.

So they might not hang out with people who have a grade B average.

So they would eventually not have as much friends.

They could also hate the other people who have the average.

They could not even participate anymore in school.

So those are some reasons why students should not have a B average to participate in school activities.

It could be hard for them to catch up, the sports and activities are there so students could have fun, and they could feel left out.

I understand their has been some controversy on whether or not to let my fellow students that aren't making a A or B in their classes are allowed to participate in extra curricular activities such as the sports programs. I believe that those students should be able to involved with the sports program.

Students who are not making A' s or B"" s just might not be able to make the grade. Some students may suffer from learning handy caps. Yet, still their are people who may that "" most kids do not try their hardest"". .To the naysayer I say this stud went my try their hardest at certain things and the best they might earn is a C. That is not the students fault. So why take away one of the only things that make them feel like they can be somebody and make nothing of their lives.

Another reason I am appose this is because the students are not at fault it is the teachers job to help them learn. People will most likely tell u the teachers give them the notes and problems to do, but are the students really learning. The young minds of the U.S need something that will catch their attention to help them learn. You could wrights down all the notes in the world ,but it won't help you if you can not keep your focus on it. So next time you say something think are tour teachers really teaching the students

My final reason I believe that they should let C students join in on fun is because the school could loose tonus of funding. Think about it. Most of the athletes on the teams are C students.

Getting a B average can be difficult.

Students need time to practice sports too.

I agree that students need to have good grades to play sports.

Part of the reason is because most students right now would not be able to play because they have a C average.

I think most students should be allowed to get a couple of C' s because it is a passing grade.

What if sport players don't understand one class but do ok in other classes that's not fair to them.

Players will also think that if they cant play because they don't have a good enough grade average they might think that they are letting people down.

I think that if the principal is going to do this then the school will not have a team she might have a average of five people on a team. If she goes to another school and look at the students that make the lowest of a C and no lower or they are off the team. She would find that they have a lot more student on their team then her school. If she would ask all the team who as made a C. A average of half the team would say they do. Most schools that have a sports teams if you make a D you will be kicked off the team. I know this because i am on a sports team i have to keep my grades up or i am off the team till i get that grade back up. If the rule if you make a C you are off the team was considered at my school most of my team would not be able to play.

If i was her i would not consider this rule it would make her lose most of her team it might just be one or two students but those two student could be your two best team players and the ones that make a B or A they have work ten times hard then what those other two students did. I would consider the principal to look in to how many students make C and then reconsider if she want this rule to be considered

Most of the sports players try not to get below a C or D but most students that play on a team are really trying to where some students that don't play sports don't really care about there grades.

Many students enjoy participating in sports and activities after school. They look forward to it and possibly have a deep passion for a particular sport, activity. It may be a good thing that they have something that they enjoy fairly well but in my opinion I think school is way more important and should come first. I agree about changing school policy that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. Although many students may have a grade C average I think they can improve and bump up their grade to a B.

To begin with, one reason why I think students education should come first before a sport or school activity is so that they can learn for the future and be able to get a good paying job when their older. The school sport or activity may be fun but students can pursue it after they have at least a B average grade. Having a decent education is highly important and I don't think students take it seriously because they're focused on the sport/activity.

In addition, if students are so focused on something else that they aren't getting good grades then it isn't setting them up well for in the future. They won't be able to get a good paying job when they're an adult. Without a job you don't have money to take care of yourself and provide for yourself. Also, you can't just rely on somebody else to take care of you your whole life, that won't work.

Not to leave out, if students would just simply focus on getting good grades in school they will do extremely well in their adulthood. They could have a elegant house, snazzy gadgets, go on exotic vacations, buy whichever car you desire getting, basically you could be living a extraordinary life. I think that's way better than relying on someone else to take care of you, buy your food, clothes, things you (want), not need. I'm pretty sure you'll have to be really lucky to find somebody to do that for you!

In conclusion, I agree that students shouldn't be able to participate in sports or school activities unless they have a B grade average. In order to graduate, go to college, have whichever job you want or would like you have to have close to perfect grades. Without going to college it will be fairly hard to find a job that will give you good money. You'll have to work your butt off in order to take care of yourself especially your family.

In reference to the action that you are considering to take, of only allowing students with a B or higher to participate in sports I think you have made a reasonable and just decision.

Our world is changing and we need the ""citizens of tomorrow"" to have in their hands the tools that they will need to be of great benefit to their society. Now is the time when the world should be crying out for more scientists, philosophers, sociologists, psychologists, etc, and knowledgeable people to continue to improve the world and solve problems.

By preventing students below a grade B from participating in sports and other activities, you are providing an incentive for the students below a B to raise up their grade and you are also providing a more adequate environment for them to do so. This will also encourage the students with a grade B or higher to keep their grade at that level.

The question you should be asking yourself is if sports in fact slows down the learning process. If grades do improve after you change the new policy then you will know you have made a good decision. It is always good to try new things and learn from your mistakes then to not do anything at all.

We should not have to have maintain a B average just to play a school sport. We as the students should be able to play sports with a high C average, and also maintain or make that grade a lot better.

Therefore I disagree that we must have a B average to attend school sports.

If we start putting up that we must have a B average then less children would try out for the sports thus shutting them down. Also if you make the students left with no other choice but to make a B average you would lose those students to the streets where you don't want them. As you would see that if you were to make the B average just to try out for sports then you would most likely lost some of your best players from the C average group. These school sports are the reason so many children want to go to school.

If you keep it at a C average then the students will keep out of the streets and away from harms way more than if you were to put up that you must have a B average. School sports are needed to keep students like us out of trouble. It'll be a good thing to keep the C average, because most of our great sports players are a C average. it would also give those students a chance to make their selves a lot better than they really are. The student who support our schools want our school to win and be proud that we won.

Therefore we should not allow only B average students to school sports it is just unfair to the students who are struggling to just make their C average, and if you were to change it most kids would believe that they are not meeting the standards to be on that team. Also it would cause a dramatic scar on the students life. You would want that student to try to make their grades better on their own not for just some sport.

I would have to disagree. Because seventy or below is passing. And it's fair. Because some people struggle in some different subjects than others. So no it shouldn't just be if you have a B average. I mean yes don't get me wrong it would be amazing to have people to get all B' s and below. I mean we are going to school and learning and if everyone starts passing that means probably better Taks scores. Because they get pushed harder to do there sport.

But what I think is some people are better at some subjects or stuff better than others. Like when I say stuff. I mean as things God made us good at.

For example I am not good at math. I try my very hardest in it thought and I end up getting a low or high B, I really do try for an A. But that's because I have God who pulls me through it. I couldn't do it all on my own. I mean I'm starting to understand more about math and its amazing. I'm taking medicine to so that helps. But like I said people are better at other stuff. And that thing for me is singing, acting, and dancing. I love to perform. It pleases me and I can use my gift in ways to glorify God. And that's one of my main purposes to leave on this earth. Now don't get me wrong Math isn't wrong or anything it's just hard on some people. Like some people's parents not might be able to afford medicine to help them. That is why I am very thank full I can have it to help me focus.

Now let's say I end up getting a C average I and I wouldn't be able to perform in choir or in cheer. I would be devastated. Because those are ways I express myself. And when you take that away it would be very hard. But of course God would get me through it. The point is I tried really hard and maybe I didn't do to well on one which brought the grade down a lot.

I know a lot of people of have this probably and I think they should get to express the stuff there good at even if they have a C. I mean at least they tried. And in the real world we get to use calculators anyways.

Then there are those kids who don't care at all for school. That's why I think you should be able to participate in your sport if you get a seventy or above.

I think it is fair that the rule is requiring at least a C average. It has been like that for all of the other students that went to this school before me. So it is only fair that you keep it the same for us too. You also might lose some students if you change the rule. You're going to get a lot of complaints from parents and students. So that will just be another thing to worry about. I'm sure that you already have enough on your hands

A lot of the students have a C average and a C is an average grade after all. Students will also be happier and will have a positive attitude at school. Besides you're supposed to have fun outside of school and a lot of people wont be able to have fun with this new rule. Also, you are supposed to get at least thirty minutes of exercise a day and some students won't get their exercise in if they cant play sports or attend activities because of their grade. I'm sure you don't want that. So please all that I am asking for is to not change the rule to a B average. If you don't change the rule it will be much appreciated by students and parents as well.

Did you know that 90% of student play sports? Well I did and most of the students that play sports at school play with a grade c average. So changing the rules so that only students with a grade b average is not a good idea. My first reason why I believe its a bad idea is because most students play sports and their grades go up. My second reason is that sports is good and healty for kids. My third reason is that students grades stay good while their playing sports.

My first reason why i think students can play sports with a grade c average is that most students who play sports play sports and their grades go up. Student tend to do better in class so the can continue play sports at school because they know that if their grades drop that they would be unable to play sports. Students also try harder to keep good grades so they can prove that they are also good in school.

My second reason is that sports are good and healthy for the students. For most student sports are the only way for them to stay in shape physically but if some students don't have a grade b average then its going to be hard for them to stay in shape because their grades are bad. Also when student play sports at school they usually have more energy for school so they are more pumped at school.

My third reason is that grades stay good. Students usually keep their grades up because they want to continue playing sports. Students become more focus when they are in school because they don't want to fail a class and get kicked of their sport's team. They also try harder to maintain their grades so they can play sports. There grades also become higher then they were because they want to keep on playing sports.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I've been hearing that trying to change no sports unless you have a B or higher. Well I disagree because theirs people that try but when they try they don't do so good. I'm pretty sure that has happened to everyone. I know it happened to me before. If you do make that rule it would actually help some people so I don't disagree and I don't agree with that rule. Well I'm in sports and its really hard to keep your grades up when your in sports because theirs things that you might not get in class. Then if you ask the teacher some may get mad and start screaming at you. Some of my teachers do that but I don't care I will still ask the teacher for help. I don't really care if they get mad I need help I want help. When I'm in sports I have to go try hard if not I'll miss a game. I already missed one game and i was so mad that I missed one because it was a tournament. I'm just happy that I get to play today. so I'm really in a good mood today because I get to play. I still cant believe I had an F I was surprised that happened I was really disappointed. Well those are my reasons and opinions.

I think that students that have a C average have the right to play sports and do other activities. The rule saying that students can't play in any sports and activities unless they are passing. The C average students are passing and it means that they can play sports or other activities.

If you establish this policy there will be less students participating in school activities. Not all students can be a B average and higher students, but they try there best to pass so they can participate in the school activities. The students that shouldn't play are the ones that have a D average or lower.

If you want the students to have a B average or higher talk to them and explain to them that if they start to have a lower grade than a C average they will not be able to play sports or participate in other school activities. The students then will want keep their grade up so they will not be forbid to participate in school activities.

Many students love to play sports and other school activities, but you will be denying the students who actually are passing and i think that is not right to deny them. They all want to keep playing sports and do school activities, but they can do that if you establish the policy that they all have to have a B average or higher to do what they love to do.

If you pass the policy there will be less students participating. If there are less students doing sports then that means that they don't have enough player to play against the other school, which means that the B average and higher students will not get to play either. The policy could affect not only the C average students, but the other students, too.

I recommend that you really think about the establishment of this policy because you will not be only affecting us the students, the students that make your school.

I believe that changing school policy that any student without a grade B average cannot play sports or school activities is a great idea. Grades should always come before any school activities so the students should have to keep their grades up or the cannot participate in any school activities. If the star of the football team was averaging a C average I don't think since he's the star on the team that he should get any chances until he gets his grades up. If the students knew they were averaging a C average and knew they couldn't play in sports or other activities until they got their grades up and you just let them play anyway they would think they could get away with anything. Without a strict way of doing things the students would try to get away with anything making the school look like their running things wrong. That's why I support the school policy change for it would make the school a lot better in so many different ways.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

The policy for participating in school sports or activities should not be changed because keeping a C average is hard enough. You may not think that we try our hardest in our classes and at school but i know for a fact that all students at least try. If many students in our school already have a C average, you already know that there will not be many students participating this year so, why even think about changing the policy? I am writing this letter to you for all of my classmates. You know that the students in our school are working to keep their grades up, therefore not disappointing any teachers, especially parents.

My suggestion for you is that you keep the policy we already have because we try our best to show you in class that we are good students, who work hard for what they do. As I am writing this letter to you, I know that you will at least think about my choice. Being a student in your school, a former athlete, and knowing what most 8th graders can do, keeping a B average is a very hard thing to do.

4ADE83D804BA,"I think that the policy is stupid. Many students love sports and some could have learning disabilities . By you saying that you wont let them play a sport is horrible. To some kids sports is everything to them . It is what they love. If you take that away from them then you are taking away there dream or passion for that sport. You make not think it is a big deal for students but it is HUGE deal . A lot of kids don't get a grade B average. It would be great but they don't . Many have a C average and that's good enough.

By you saying that you wont let anyone but B average kids is wrong .

Did you ever think that maybe some students have a hard time at home ? Yeah i don't think so cause then otherwise you wouldn't be needing this policy. Many students hate there life at home and the only way they can get away from it is from sports . Plus kids need to do physical activity to stay healthy . Being smart or doing good in school is a good thing but being healthy is even better for you .

Not that many people have a B average so not that many people would be able to play sports . You may not even have enough people for a team ! More students would feel stressed out because they would always try to do better so they could play a sport . by making people not follow there dream or passion would really hurt them. Come on don't u want a great school full of happy kids and not having kids hate you ?

I'm pretty sure you do .

Hopefully after reading this you will understand that having the B average was a bad idea .

Just let everyone play . It would be a better school . Plus you wouldn't have depressed kids wishing they were on the team . You should come up with a better policy that all students would like . Or at least most of them would like .

And don't make it about sports cause that would be a bad idea. I hope you will change your mind about this policy .",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

Imagine a boy who goes to football practice at school knowing that he worked hard for it by raising his grade. This would be the result of having students need a grade B average to do sports and other activities. I believe that by passing this rule the average letter grade of students will rise from a C to at least a B. First of all, students will earn their place in sports and other activities knowing they earned it through hard work and focus. Second, more students will be encouraged to do well in school. Last but not least, students grades will be considerably higher.

While some students may rebel to the idea with myriad reasons it should not be passed, I believe that grades are still very important. A well rounded education is the base to having successful grades in school. Although students are given this they are not putting as much attention and effort into their work. By passing this rule more students will take the issue at hand more seriously and suitably.

So as you can see, by passing a rule where students have to have a grade B average to participate in sports and other activities, you will be endorsing the idea that all students should focus on school.

I think that making students have at least a b average in their classes is wrong. My reasoning for this statement is that most student have trouble getting at least a c average yet alone a b average. If you were going to do this there would be a lot less people participating in extra curricular activities therefore less money for your school. Most of the kids participating in your extra curricular activities are jocks not geniuses. There would be a lot of people protesting this issue because without sports and other extra curricular activities a lot of the kids would have not made the friends they have today. These activities are not only about the competition its about having fun. The schools are trying to promote a healthier life style but without sports the kids would be less active and therefore there would be an increase in the obesity rates. Sports should be a healthy way to be more active not a way to make students spend hours a night studding. If u were to do this you might as well have no extra curricular activities at all because the wouldn't be enough students participating in them. I think the policy should stay the same not make it harder to have a social life. I personally hate the idea of this because school would be less fun without these activities to participate in. Most kids don't like school to begin with so this policy would just make it worse and make more high school drop outs. These activities are the only way some people are going to get to go to college. In today's tough economy less and less students can afford college so they need the athletic scholarships. You don't want to ruin the students education do you? Exactly your trying to help them not put them down. The educational directors are supposed to promote it not make them not want to even attempt to go to college.

I think you should change the policy, because students probably don't get an ""B"" just like that cause of there grades or low, and some kids play good for sports, and other kids would like to join.

First, thing I have to say about that is that some of this kids grades are low, but they be trying hard to pull up their grades but it won't wroth it cause you want let them participate because you want everybody that has an ""A"" or a ""B"" average. Another reason, why because students would look at you, and say ""we tried "", and it would not be right to see other students playing.

Secondly, reason because people that you say wont participate in sports can really play good, and probably will be something in life, but they could not play cause of you.

Lastly, other people would like to join instead of the people that have that good grade. Because students don't want to be in the class rooms all day just doing work or any other thing, instead of having fun with the other kids, and talking to their friends.

Conclusion, change the policy because other people would like to join.

I am writing this letter to tell you that if you change the school policy to make it impossible to participate in sports or other activities without a B average then school activities will become a thing that only a group of people will get to enjoy. Many of the students have lower than a B average and I think it is unfair to only let a few people participate in activities when the majority can't. I think that if the majority had a B average or above then it would be fine, but to exclude most of the students is just not right in my book.

I think the school's activities should be open to anyone who wants to join. This brings many different people together where they can learn from each other and learn new things.

I don't think that in order to do sports, you have to have a B grade average. Many students only have a C grade average, so many students that would like to participate in sports can not. I believe that it is highly unfair to make this a policy. Many students might not be able to get a B average for a reason, such as problems at home. They might have a disability and that inter fears with their school work and grades.

Some one might be Hypoglisimic, and when they don't eat, they don't function right, and they don't even know they are Hypoglisimic. So when their grade averages out, they have a C because of their condition.

You need to open your eyes and realize that there are people that can't help that they might have a reason for not doing so well in school. i do believe, however, that they do need a certain grade average. I just believe that it should stay at a C, but for the semester, they can have no more than two F' s on their report card and must have a physical done and completed before the tryout's. At least that way not only do they get to try out if they meet my suggested requirements, they can also try something new, or follow their dreams.

For me, I love playing Volleyball, and it is just so much fun for me and it makes me happy, but I am Hypoglisimic, and I also have low blood sugar, and that was affecting me in school. I had a C in my Language Arts class, because I was so hungry and couldn't concentrate properly. If the grades came out, I would have a C average, and wouldn't have been able to try out for Volleyball. And if I still didn't get my grade up by the time Track was going to start, I wouldn't be able to tryout then either. All because I was, and still am, Hypoglisimic.

Many people have a disability and don't even know it and it affects them in school. Many people also like or love to do sports, such as Volleyball, Track, Basketball, Football, etc., and they wont be able to tryout all because they have a C grade average, and it might be because they have a disability, and because of that, the sports and other activities are taken away from them.

Sometimes students have poor grades that give them a C grade average because it is the teachers fault. I say this from my own experience. I was out for a week and two days because i was very sick, and it took my Language Arts teacher several days to get my makeup work packet put together, and it wasn't because there was so much, she just wouldn't do it. My mother went down there and heard from the councilor herself. And the thing that happened with that same teacher, is that for that week and two days, she only gave me part of the packet, so i had a bunch of things still missing and it was from when i was out. We had an in class test that was done on the laptops she has in the class, and she never told me about it, and she wasn't putting in grades for papers that she graded herself and gave back to me. So for the first semester, i was failing her class or barley getting a C. So I had a C average for my actual grade.

It is not always the students fault for their grades, sometimes the teachers are just as much at fault. That, or it might just be the computers not getting the grades in when the teachers enter them. There are many reasons why a student, or many, would have a C grade average.

I don't believe you should make a policy to have students have a B grade average to participate in sports and other activities in school. There is people with disabilities, teachers not putting in grades, or the computer wont take them. If grades are put into the computer and the computer wont take them, then the entire grade gets messed up. The requirements I had listed before, I hope you take them into consideration before making your final decision.

I think that it is good idea to change the policy for students. I think that it is good because if you don't have a good grade then you shouldn't be able to play sports. Kids who don't have a good grade average means they don't do their homework. Homework is to be done at home and if they don't do their homework then they shouldn't go to practice or maybe stay after school to go to practice. The kids should make up their work and actually do homework rather then go to practice and other activities.

Another reason is that, if they stay back they should be kicked off the team because it isn't fair that the kids who do good and pass get to do another year.

Another reason is that, the kids who do good in school do their homework and still go to practice when other kids are lazy. Its not fair to other kids who do their homework. Maybe you should warn the kids about the policy so they could get their grades up before you actually change the policy so a lot of kids don't get kicked out of their sport. If they don't bring their grades up and get kicked out of their sport, if they bring their grades up maybe you can allow them to go back to their sport.

Its not fair to the students who have a C that are very good at a sport than those who have an A or B that are bad at sports.

Students are going to argue and argue until they can play their sports so if you would be kindly to take this policy off. I lot of students would appreciate it so they wouldn't keep arguing. Maybe some of these student who have a C can grow up to be a professional soccer or football player or any other professional sport. They have dreams too you know just like you when you were little.

At my school in the SCHOOL_NAME is that policy and i am glad too have it but it didn't really matter to me because i was just falling! I was falling because of all my test and everything but i think its just dumb if you have to have at least a B average if that was our school i would at least write a banner saying we should have at least be passing five of our classes and we should be able to have a 1.5 grade point average that's when freedom of speech comes in!

F6E5E7C080A5,"We should definitely change the school policy! Having a B average to get into sports seems like the right thing to me! First of all, having a C average is not a good grade to me. Second, A sport is a privilege, and if all it takes to go for a sport is to get a B average, I think that us kids are smart enough and willing enough to get B' s. Also, most kids do wan' t to go for sports, so they would get B' s and it would look better for our school.

First, a C average is not that impressive to too many people unless they are known for getting even lower.

Getting B' s is not all that difficult if you pay attention. I feel that kids who have a C average are not giving their all in their work. I also think us kids would be prouder if we got B' s!

Second, we should be pretty great kids to get into sports! I mean, sports are privileges and getting good grades should be the reason we get into sports! It would make us work just a little bit more hard in class if someone told us that getting B' s is what it takes. And all it takes to get a B is paying attention and actually studying. In 8th grade we should definitely be able to get B' s.

Lastly, a lot of kids want to go for sports, so a lot would end up getting B' s. For our school to be a B average school would be a great achievement! and if all kids needed to do was to get C' s, then we would, and we would be a C school. I think being a B over a C school is much better!

Think of how many B' s we would get if that's what we needed to get into sports!

So my answer is yes! Absolutely! to begin with, to me, C' s are not all that great. And second, we are much more intelligent enough to get B' s! And lastly, our school would be much more appreciated if we were a B school. We can handle getting B' s if its for sports!",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
787BA22FD1CF,I think it would be a good idea if students cant play any sports or any other activities without having a B grade average. Say if a student had an F or a D how do you expect them to improve there grades if they have practice and things like that. They probably wouldn't have enough time to finish there homework or study for tests or for a pop quiz because they would be to worried about making it to practice or the game that's coming up. So if the students can only play sports with a B grade average more students would probably try to bring there grades up so they can play. I know that boys like to play football and basketball so they would try to bring there grades up the a B average . Girls might not like to play sports so they probably wouldn't care about this so much. But then again some kids might not tryout for the team because they probably don't like to study or do homework so they wont get a B average.

My view on the change of the grade to play sports from a C to a B is a very good change. I like it because you are trying to make the students work a little harder. Also, you are trying to make the best of their education which is a great idea. You are trying push the students a little harder which is good.

Being an average student is not that bad but, it is not that good either. You are making a right decision about changing the grade from a C to a B. You are trying to make our school also a better choice for more students to come to our school because we can give a good education to the kids. You are trying to show more expectations for the student who knows they can do it, but need to try harder to play any sports because people might think you are bad in school and the coach might take you off the team.

So I think you are making the right decision by changing the grade to do any activity in school from a C to a B.

Even though people think it is a bad idea because they are the C average student and they don't want to try harder to get a better grade in their classes. They think they can do great things in life by being average but it does not work like that. You have to be an A B student to get some where in life so you have my vote to change the grade to do any activities from a C to a B.

The change you have made in the policy of maintaining a B grade average to participate in other school activities is a great decision.

There are many reasons why this is a good decision.

For example students will be forced to work harder in school.

The students would be study more and to do their homework more often if they wanted to play any sports or other after school activities.

Further more the some of the students would be less stressed over tests they have to take.

The students would of studied more to get at least a B on the tests so they wouldn't be as worried about the test.

The students would also become smarter and will realize school comes before sports or other after school activities.

This would help them in other activities that they are doing such as sports.

The students will work a lot harder in school by changing the policy.

Changing the policy from maintaining a C average to a B average is a Good idea.

The students will study harder, do their homework, and become smarter by doing this.            ",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

I think you have made an excellent choice for raising the average that students must have in order to play sports.

Although you have made it more challenging for the students to play a sport you are helping them in their educational lives.

The students should thank you because you have given them a better chance to get into a great college.

I say that because you have to have good grades for a college scout to even come out and watch you play.

It does not matter if you are the best athlete in the world if your failing colleges will not pick you.

Also if your a pretty good player but not exactly the best, but you have a great grades they will sign you.

Trust me you are making the students future and success in life better than it would have been if that student was just average.

When you were a child did you ever have classmates who got away with lower than average grades and still did activities?

This is how us B or higher grade average students feel. Student should have good grades to participate in anything. C average students are already on the verge of failing and do not have limitations to what they can do. This is like an example of letting a little boy hit his sister and get away with it because he ""didn't mean to"". Children who don't succeed should have a punishment, without a punishment they won't learn and will keep behaving the wrong way, and therefore, still get away with it. People have to learn, and if they don't learn right the first time it will become a bad habit of failing.

Parents should have to sign a paper, as well as teachers with the grade on it. Thus, if the grade is lower than an average B they shall not be able to participate. And there must be a parent/ teacher conference regarding the grade, how it got there, and how it can be fixed to let them do activities. If the requirements aren't met then the parent, and student should have a conference with the teacher and talk about what is wrong.

Children who work hard deserve to have a break and do something they want. But with C grade average people participating in those activities, C average students should have some limitations for what they are not doing right. When children do something wrong they must go in time out. So when a student fails, they must pay for what they did by not being able to participate in activities that are fun and interesting like sports and dances.

When children fail they must pay the consequences, and in this case, not be able to participate in school activities. It is not fair to the children at the school who do get good grades and participate to have to know they spend much more time working to perfect a grade just to participate with classmates who don't work half as hard and still participate.

I think that students should have the right to have at least a C average because some of them may be having troubles at home. This could also meant that your star spiker or running back or anything could be out of the game and you do not want that. It could affect the lives of many people and their children and that would not be good at all. If students were only allowed to have B averages then this means that they would have to study a lot more and this can lead to a lack in sports efforts and or result in the loss of not being able to play the game that they like.

If students are looking to get a football scholarship or even just a sports scholarship then yes they have to get good grades of course but what if they are always at practice and they never have time then to review for tests and or quizzes and the fail them then this means they cannot play. You should not take the player from the game because it is not fair. If Brett Farve, or even Eli Manning got bad grades then of course he could not play but this does not mean that he tried very hard to at least keep his grades up.

This may result in smarter students but this then may mean that the sports teams may be bad because they spend all of their time on school, and trying to get better grades. Also no principle wants to have or represent a school that has a bad athletic ability and or team. it is not fair to the students who may not just be smart enough to comprehend what the are learning. If they can at least keep a C average I think things would still be good, and they could still have decent grades and still play their favorite sports. Without sports students may fail even more miserably because they know that they cannot play because of their grades. B averages of course could also help them. It just depends on the player and their ability's to learn in the classroom and on the court or the field.

Without sports the school would have nothing fun to do for activities and it would just be boring for students and they may even hate the school even more than they do already, or they may switch to a school that has a C average and you could and may lose many students because of this new rule. Sports can play a big role in students lives because some of them may want to become professional. If they do become professional with all C averages then their grade does not really even matter anymore. All they are going to do is play that sport and their is no need for them to have to know anything besides what's going in the game and what to do in the game to be successful.

There is also no pint in changing the grade letter for passing from B to C. Almost all schools or a majority of them have it so you at least have to have a C to pass because not all kids are smart and or have a good comprehension or learning ability. Like I said before in the top few paragraphs. America is a place that needs to be equal everywhere and I think that the letter grade should stay where it is and it should be made a state law because it has been this way for awhile and lots of students and parents and guardians may think that this is not fair.

This is my view on the whole grades subject being changed. You do not want to break the heart of your students and it may affect you long term. If they come professional than they could be thankful for having all C averages and or better grades. You could be known around also it could fill your heart with happiness knowing that you helped a younger kid that is your student.

I believe that you should not change the school policy. My views on the subject is that the policy stay the same. Not only has the policy been the same for several years but, some students are not the brightest in some subjects and many students could barely even hold up a C average. Many of the students at this school are looking forward to scholarships in the sports and other activities they are in. In most cases students not only love what they are doing but, also like the teachers who help them out.

I am up for your new idea to have a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities.

One reason is because if the students know they have to have a B average to participate in any school activities they're grades will go up and it'll be more honor students and no failures. They'll also want to keep they're grades up so they wont get kicked off the team because if its something they really enjoy doing why would they want to stop because of they're grades being bad.

Another reason is they'll focus more, by focusing more they'll know how and what to do on they're homework instead of not doing it because they don't understand so that means they'll pay attention more, which helps the teacher not get off task cause she knows someone isn't paying attention and I know the students who really pay attention would like that because they wont get distracted while they're trying to learn.

My last reason for this idea would be less getting in trouble, the more they know they'll get kicked off the team for the trouble they get in to and their grades, so that means they'll stay out of the drama and trouble they see. And them staying out of trouble could lead them somewhere good in the future and I know the principal would enjoy not seeing kids in the office for getting in trouble.

Hence this , if the Principal did this the students grades will go up they'll focus more, and get in less trouble. I'm sure the teachers would love to have better grades and less distractions in class so it'll go through quicker.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

It seams to me that you have a idea of changing the school policy to students that play sports may not play them if they are not maintaining a B grade average in school. I think this is preposterous because some of our best athletes that play sports don't maintain a B average most of them make a C average. We will lose all of our good sport records and will not be able to win in any of the sports that we play in like wrestling, football, soccer, baseball and other sports. This will bring our school's reputation down to nothing.

This school is based on our work and our sports but some of our people who do the best in our sports will not be able to play anymore and them what are we going to do about our sport records. Also you have to think about all the people in the school that will not be able to play sports and will get fat if they don't have anything else to do in there extra time. If you change that students will not have no exercise and will do nothing but play video games and then we will have nothing but couch potatoes at our school.

But you also make a good point in this because it may make people want to do more or better in there class rooms and then they will make better grades to be able to play sports. Maybe your plan will work and kids will do better in there school work and give us a better school report and it will be for sports and education and then we will have good sports teams and will have students who will make better grades in school.

People have different opions on this kind of stuff but mine is not on either side of the fence. I think that it will be kind of good to make it where kids are not aloud to play sports with c averages. But then we will lose an=lot of people in our sports and will not have good sports teams. Because some of the people will just continue to keep the grades they have and just not participate in sports. But some of the people will try harder and will make better grades just to participate in sporting events. Well all i can say is that this is your school you can do what you want to with it.

I am against the new policy that you have to have a B average in order to play any sports. I think that you should be able to at least have a C average not just have a B average, Because just having A' s and B' s is not exactly that easy for all students. Some students have trouble to having a C average. If students weren't able to play in sports they would not be able to communicate with other students. Probably not get along with other students as much they need to learn how to work together on something and sports is the way to do that, because in sports you work together on something and that's the way to learn to work as a team. That's how you get along in life some times, you have to work as a team. Also to some students they just love to play sports and have fun. A student may want to be in the NFL, so if there in jr.... high and the can't play football how are they going to get any better to play NFL, just because they couldn't get a B average. Some students could get scholarships by playing sports, and scholarships are very important to some students. Some students may want to get into a very good college, but they don't have very much money so that will help them very well. Or there not very smart and they want to still be in a good college so they could play for a team there at that college. Also if most of the students have C' s and they need a B average how are you going to have a team, because if you are playing baseball and you only have maybe five players that have a B average how is that going to work to have a whole team, not very well. Also students play sports to stay in shape, because more and more kids are starting to be over weight. I get that it is very important to have good grades especially when your in high school, so that could help you get into college. If it helps for students improve on there grades then i would agree with the B average idea. If I had to have my grades at a B average I would also have troubles keeping it like that, and I would be very upset if i couldn't play sports, cause sports sometimes feel like there part of my life style. If sports weren't in my life then part of my life would be missing.

School policy should change so that only students with a grade B average or above can participate in sports and other activities. Three reasons for the new policy are that school is a place to learn, sports and other activities keep students from doing homework, and students in school activities should maintain a creditable grade so that the students who have a C average and lower can raise their grades and the school's funding.

Foremost, school is a place to learn. Many students need to spend more time learning rather than going out and playing. If students with grade C average were in sports that would not help them much with their schoolwork. Other activities might keep them from going to class. Some sports and activities even take students out of class, and students should not lose class time if their grade is a C average or less.

Next, other activities and sports may keep students from doing their homework. The students with a C average or less are the ones who mostly need to do their homework. Recent statistics have shown that 90% of students fail classes because they are unable to complete or do their homework. Sports and other activities usually keep students after school, thus preventing them from having their afternoon to complete their homework.

Then, the school and students will both be awarded if they have good grade. The student can have a better future for college with outstanding grades. The school will also be more recognized. Therefore they will receive more money.

Finally, the reasons for agreeing with the change of policy are that there will be better grades and good reputation.      ",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I like the idea that all students must have a B average to participate in any activities but, there's one problem. Many students at our school can't maintain a B average because of there behavior sometimes can be a problem in class. Most of them get kicked out off class, get wrote up on a referrals, parents get called, and etc. I understand what your trying to do but, if there's no sport or other activities then there's no us. I'm suggesting that what you need to do is lower the standards at the school to a high C average such as 74% and above. Then maybe that will make a difference to the school and they will try to keep there average up so, that they can play sports or other activities. I know they can do it because I'm one of the A/B average students at this school and I represent my school well. So, if you could just change that one thing in our policy I promise you that you want be let down and I will try to set a meeting or announcement about it and get more students involved in this issue since i' m in student council.

Well I think that it would be a good idea to change the sport participation grade to a B average. Why? well because that is a major help when it comes to grades. one reason why is because the students what to play sports, and if they do not have reasonable grades then some are not eligible to play. that could also effect lazy ones who don't try and turn there work in on time, because if they wanted to play a sport he or she would not be able to. so there is one reason why i think that you should change the grade point average to a b instead of a c.

another reason is, well if you look around and see all of the children in the school and how many in here play sports. and then think to your self and you would problem say to yourself ""that could be a lot of grate grades. i know from personal experience, because i played a sport and i got kicked off of the team because of my grades, and that motivated me a whole lot to start doing good then i brought my grades up and got back on the team. so you can see that student all want to play sports and so i think that it would be a good idea to change the average.

I believe that having to maintain of have a b average can be a good and bad thing. The good side is that the people with the c averages will have more time to concentrate on their work instead of basketball or other sports. On the other hand, it could be a bad thing because some people are trying their hardest but they just can't get the b average and they should be able to play sports.

The idea of having people in sports maintain a b average has some benefits. There is the obvious everyone in sports are passing. The benefit of the players having good grades will show they are responsible and trustworthy. You also would not have to worry about the games getting in their way because of their grades. Maintaining a b average also gives the players a border line on their grades; helping them focus so they can stay on the team. It also might make people want to try to get the b average, raising their grade, to get into the sports.

The idea of having players maintain a b average can also be a bad thing. They could make the team and start to forget about their grades. They also might feel pressured because they have to sustain a certain grade to play something they love to do for the school they want to represent. We might also be missing out on very talented sports stars by setting a line in which they have to be in to play sports. For example, we could have a really talented basketball player but his or her grades start slipping and they are taken out of basket ball.

The idea of having to have at least a b average can go many directions. Though it seems like its a fabulous idea it could hurt our athletic group. I think the statement ""setting an average they have to be at in order to play sports"" is a very intelligent idea, but maybe a c+ or something more reasonable for students to reach would be a better guideline. Though some might think it is unreasonable, its a fair decision and i go along with your decision. I hope you consider my thoughts.

I heard you were thinking about changing the policy's for athletes to play sports. I think its a good idea that you make all the athletes get a B or higher on there report card. The reason I think its a good idea is because school is generated to get kids into college so they can get good jobs but if they have a C in 3 subjects there passing but barley passing and they may not get into college. If they have a B or A in every subject they are more likely to go to college. Another reason why I agree is because athletes think that they can slack off if they have a C then its distracting to other students that are trying to concentrate on there work because the athletes will just talk and yell out in class. Are school may go down in players for sports but eventually they will learn that they cant just slack off in class they actually got to try and get good grades to play. I think this may have more an affect on the people who start in games because they want to play more then the rest of the team and they don't want to lose there starting spot because its hard to get back once you lose it. This policy will probably work better if you get the parents involved with it because most athletes have a parent that wants them to play and they will be very mad if they cant play just because they slacked off in class they will probably get grounded in till there grades come up to were they can play again.

I believe that the policy of having at least a B average to participate in school sports or activities is the correct thing to do. I believe this because, students who don't have at least a B average, or better, won't be able to handle having a good grades in school. They'll either be to busy to not do homework or to lazing to do school work. Or the student will be too sleepy in class. Also the student might not be focusing in school as much as they used to.

My first reason for this policy to be passed is that, if the below B average student goes to his or hers sport practices or meetings they would probably neglect their homework and school work. Which would cause the student to get an even lower grade average! Unlike with an A or B student who would always at least try to complete their school work and homework.

I'm against the possible policy change because most students have a grade average of a c. I'm against this because most student learn different ways so for some students its easy and for others its hard. This happens because everybody mind frames are not the same as others some are more advanced than others are and some are much more slower than the others. With this being said most of the people on a sports team average a b or c because its hard to maintain a grade with all of that on your hands.

If this new policy is made this might bring down most of the athlete's of our school because their average is right at a c or a little higher. This will stress the children out because they will be worrying about their grades and performance as a player. This may stop children from joining a sports team because they know they can't manage their grades and a sport so they just don't try at all because they are discourage by their bad grades. Sport teams will become smaller and smaller because of this policy about the grades because some people can't take trying to handle two things at one time our even the basic work. This may cause for schools to cancel sports all together.

The reason why im against this is because this isn't fair towards the students because everyone isn't made to be smart or dumb but they are here for a reason and the reason mite be for sports.

I write to you, to argue against your wanted new school policy on sports. I do not believe that student should not be able to participate in sports with out a B average. I find that very wrong to be completely honest with you, because from my point of view some students are only capable of a C average, because of a slight learning disabilities or any thing of that sort.

My point of view is that any student should be able to play a sport as long as they are passing, not just with a C average, with a passing average. I know there are some students that don't want to try in school, but try hard in sports. Doesn't mean you should punish the whole school because of them. I am a straight A student believing that this is unfair, even though I would be eligible to play because I have good grades.

But there are honestly people trying that just don't get it, and get lower grades because of the not understanding of the material. Or it could possibly be the teacher not teaching it a way the child understands it. I think you should be proud that your school is all obtaining a C average of above, and not punish them by taking there sports from them. Our school needs our athletes!

If you keep this policy, it can really help the students to do better at two things! I think students need education before free time because when you go to college, you cant just show up and say I want to play football and just leave, you will get kicked out! I think they need students to understand the importance of what you need in the future, not jut now. For example, if you play football, cool but that probably wont get you anywhere in life. Out of this school I bet only one student will actually go through with it and turn it into their future in to NFL football out of all the fifty students. I also think if you get students to work first then they will even have more fun playing then before because after they work they get it all done and don't have to worry about teachers making them make stuff up like they probably were before. If students could just play football and not worry about their grades, they wont have anything to do in life. I also think students will pick fun over school so if you give them the work before they can do anything, then they will eventually learn some good stuff to having a B.

After knowing some students had nothing to do in life because they were working on sports than school, I would be ashamed. Its not right for students to suffer when principles can take a charge. And for some girls, they are really into volleyball but you need to know all different school related stuff for those skills. If you did horrible in school and kept failing then decided to get out of school, then you cant play sports either because they're apart of the school. And for basketball, for the plays, you need to know math in order to do anything! If they don't care about their education or math, they will also do horrible in sports so you need school. But for students, if you don't have to do something that's school related, then people aren't going to do it so you have to make it a rule to be a B average at least.

Actually a B isn't that hard of what you are asking, it isn't an A like its impossible to get. Its just asking for the same effort some students out into their sports.

I think before this gets passed onto next generations, we have to change it now before more students live it.

Students might only get the B average to play sports but its better than a C because at least you know they are still learning to get that B for quizzes they have to do. But i think that will be a great idea to make it a B average. Also at this school we have activities that students love.

I like being in the club No Place for Hate and i understand if my grade is a C i wouldn't be able to do it so I will make sure I don't get lower than a B even so I can be in the club because I like it. It is also kind of an award, a privilege to be in certain clubs and if you cant still keep your grades, you loose it till you get your grades up again. In the later run, I think tons of students would be thankful for the principle actually standing up to the students. Making a B average to any sports or activities is a great idea. It can really help students out. I know sports is a big thing, I even like sports and the activities we have but its not going to be easy for us in high school or college so we need to get prepared before it is too late.

Many students would be angry because they would think they would have to quit right away because they have a C average and have no time to get the work done, after a while they should be able to get the work done for school so they can play sports. The other problem with changing that policy is that a C is better than a D and it shows that they try to keep up good grades but a B would be better people who play sports and have a B average that's good and people who have a C average should at least try to bring their grade up to a B average. The principal should talk with the students before anything and try to get them to get there grades up before changing that policy also the principal should wait for the next school year to make any changes because its not right for the students who love sports and for the school because it could be the year they go to a championship game and bring back a trophy for the schools trophy case.

I understand that education and academics is more important than sports or other activities but most students find it real difficult to keep up our grades, study for tests, and even do homework because we feel that we are being pushed passed our limit and we are too busy to continue to focus on academics. And most times students feel overwhelmed with homework and its just too much for us to handle so students become involved in sports or other activities to stop and take a break from academics so that we don't become too stressed out because it could eventually lead to depression and fatigue and we begin to lose interest and don't forth much effort into what we are trying to accomplish. And academics isn't the only thing that allows us to continue on and progress in life, students who are real athletic and are talented in a specific sport may receive a scholarship to college for being excellent and may continue to play a professional sport.

I don't quite agree with the new policy that you are considering. I understand where you are coming from. That not being able to play sports with a C average, students will want to do better. But this goal might be too high for some students, and some students might just give up and not even try. With all due respect, I think that a B average is too unreasonable.

Also since majority of the students already have a C average then the sports team will not have enough students to play, so some students my not even want to play since the teams are so small.

I think it would be more fair students with a D or F average can't play, but I think students with a C average should be able to participate.

In school, grades and sports play an important roll in the future of the students. Sports are meant to keep young people out of trouble and are enjoyable to many people. In order to keep kids motivated to do better in school, their grades should have to be acceptable. I agree that a B average should be the lowest grade a student should maintain in order to continue in their sport or activity.

The future of the students is more important than the extra activities, in my opinion. If the student cant keep the grade at a B average and try their hardest to complete their school work, I don't think they need the sport as a distraction.

When the students reach adulthood, their test scores will most likely effect their career choices, not how well they were athletically. To get young people to succeed, sometimes they need a little push in the right direction.

To motivate students to do better in school, i believe grades should effect whether they can participate in certain sports or not. Education is the way to a better life.

I think it is important you do so. People with an C or lower in their grades should focus more on working to get their grades up, because in sports they will only use up very needed time they could be studying or doing very important homework at home for sports. It needs to be done there are lots and lots of people failing, not being able to go to college, or losing their jobs. Education is way more important than sports. If they have a B or higher let them take sports.

Think of how many people do sports more than homework. When they could be doing homework their at a game when their grades are low. They don't realize what their doing to their selves, they are smashing their grades down lower if they can't focus. Without sports for them to do they will focus more on their grades, and that is what we need.

People are failing their classes and staying in the same grade. If you cut sports off the people who have as low as a C in their grades they won't fail. And think of people not being able to go to college with a great education, you need to cut it off it will make them better and they will be ready. So cut out the sports on people that have really low grades so they succeed in life.

To whom it may concern:

The recent notice of changing the policy about students participating in sports must have a B average instead of a C average is a wonderful idea. This would cause student athletes to be more responsible, and think twice when it comes to stupid decisions.

First off, students that want to participate in a school sport would force them to get better grades to do something they love to do. Students would try harder in there classes versus the student athletes who get so-so grades and are missing assignments. Most student athletes do well in school anyway so they wouldn't get major affected by this change.

Secondly, this would make the student athletes think twice about making stupid decisions. for example it would most likely make the student do there homework every night. Also it would make some student athletes think twice about ditching school

Some people may argue that this new policy would put stress on student athletes, worrying about how they have to get good grades. That is what school is all about, pretty much if you do your homework every night, listen to instructions, and come to school every day, i guarantee you student athletes wouldn't have to worry about a thing.

In conclusion students with at least a B average will be able to play a sport versus a C average. This would make students think twice about some decisions. also it would teach student athletes about responsibility.

They think when they grow up they will become a rich and famous athlete or an artist but they don't understand why they need a an education to do so. Most schools have a rule that you must have a 2.0 or higher to do sports or activities after school and that is one of the only reasons most children decide to work at all is to be able to take these pleasures after school. Students will understand that having a B average or higher grants you these after school festivities.

One day the child that grew playing a sport such as basketball is going to go out for the NBA and there's only one spot left but the person next to them is much more talented and gets the spot, they have nothing to fall back on they don't have the knowledge to know what to do next.

94C2AC40437B,"Dear Sir/Ma'am,

The idea of not letting kids participate in sports or school activities is on some levels a good idea and a bad idea. There are many ways it could be a bad idea, for instance, some kids might not be able to and if they aren't able to participate then the program won't prosper, which means that the program would serve as no use to the school. It is also a bad idea because parents could look forward to seeing their child out on that field or on the court playing a sport they use to play growing up. Parents that take the time to go to their children's activities are very good parents and would like to see their kids grow up to play one of those sports. It is also a bad idea because maybe basketball or soccer or a sport or activity is all that is keeping that kid out of becoming a criminal.

The idea could also serve some benefits. The fact that some kids couldn't do what they love would make some break down and do all their work to maintain that B average. That alone could be all the school needs to boost test scores. Some kids would probably say that they don't care if they play a sport or participate in any activity, but you would have a vast majority that like to do what they love and doing what you love is what you do best, isn't it?

There are more bad consequences than good, so if it were me i would just leave it the way it is. I mean a C average is better than a D or F average isn't it? So I and many others would say to leave it the same. You are the principal and we are the students. All you want to do is make sure we get a good education. So for the sake of us and our school, please leave it the way it is. Maybe all we need is someone to sit down with us and tells us just how important it is to just do our best. That we don't need to be a genius to get through school that all we need to do is listen to the teachers and do what they say and do it how they show us. Then it wouldn't make it so hard to get through school.

So in conclusion, make an educated decision based on what has happened with other schools that have done the same thing so that way you won't make the wrong decision. You are our principal and we know that all you do is to benefit us. So when you make a decision then just make the decision to leave everything the same.

I would have to disagree with the B average to be in sports or other school activities. There are many students in our school that love sports, mostly guys, but they shouldn't just have a B average to participate. Many students with C averages want to do or just love sports and school activities but they wont be able to do any if you change the grade average. I don't think the grade average should matter on whether if students should or should not participate in the school sports or activities. So many students that go to the schools want to be in sports or activities but wont be able to if the grade average changes. If you change the grade average then some students wont be able to get the daily exercise that they need. Maybe the sports and activities at school are the only things some students look forward to be doing during or after school days. If the grade average ends up changing some kids will think that they wont be able to do anything else because they aren't in the sports or activity programs. They may feel like if they are able to be in the sports or other school activities then they aren't able to do anything else.

Some students may need everyday exercise but wont be able to get it because they don't have the right grades to participate in the school activities or sports.

If students really want to be included in these activities, then that may motivate them to keep their grades up and have more self motivation also.

If students were allowed to participate with an C average then they may get the idea that their grades don't really matter as much.

Also it is good to give the students that do maintain a B average or higher a reward, by allowing them to participate in extra activities. This would give them more self motivation by knowing that they get rewarded for doing well in school. On the down side of this change, some students that do have a C average may try hard but their get discouraged because they do try but their grades still have not improved as they would have liked them to.

Another thing is that not all B average students may want to participate in activities and sports. Instead there may B some C average students that may want to be apart of certain activities but are not able to because of their low grade averages. As a B average student myself I know of some C average students that would like to participate in activities and they do try hard to improve their grades but the average is still the same.

I heard that you are considering changing school policy for students to have at least a B average to participate in sports. Though, most kids have a C average. I believe that this is a beneficial idea to do. This could cause kids to do better in school and try harder in class.

The idea of at least a B average is an extraordinary idea. This is extraordinary because kids would have to put in more effort. Some kids just slack off because they know that they can get a C average to stay in sports and not try to excel. They don't really try harder because that would require them to have to put in more effort then they may believe that they really need to. For the students that normally get C average would probably take more effort into trying harder and do their best because they will want to stay in sports.

This could also help benefit the students. This would benefit them because this will help the students to try harder and get better grades to stay in the sports. Getting better grades will help them get a better education and be more successful in life. Not only does this benefit the students, it also helps the school look better overall. Before the school was mostly just a C average school but if it becomes a B average school, more people might want to go to go there because it will have students that are doing more successful academically.

I think this idea of B average to be in sports could really be beneficiary. Though, there are some dire consequences. For example, if students have to have a B average and are struggling making a C average but are trying their hardest, the students are more likely to just quit the sport. They could always play that sport at home. This would cause the sports teams to have less people though this would be easier to help pay for equipment for the students still on the teams.

There are some dire consequences and some benefits for requiring students getting at least a B average to be in sports. Overall, I believe that this is an amazing opportunity for kids to try harder and do better. Being more successful will pay off quite well in life.

The b average requirement should not be revised. These extracurricular activities should only be allowed for the students who try the hardest in their classes. Those students have earned themselves this and shouldn't share them with people that have anything less than a b average. This is coming from a middle school student who takes algebra 1 in 8th grade and is recommended for English honors for high school next fall. That isn't pleased with a single b in any class that gets straight a' s.

I think all students should be able to participate in sports or other activities even if they have a C average on their grades because the principle may not know how good the student is on the activity or in the sport. The student may be able to represent the school based on the activity or sport they know how to do best.

If the students had a lower than a C average then they couldn't be able to play because their grade would be lower. If the students had a B average then they should be able to play sports or participate in other activities because they are not failing any classes.

I think your being unfair with the students who have a C average because they are still passing the class but not with the best grade yet, they should be able to join activities and sports because they are still passing their classes.

I think you should let them participate because without the ones who play more sports and join activities you will have less chances of making your school better by showing how good a person with a C average is in sports or activities.

If you let the students with a C average play sports you might not know if they are good at sports and they could represent your school by winning a game like for example: baseball, football, soccer, etc. these students can make a better chance of your school being number one on sports and activities so please rethink and make the right choice.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

I do not like the idea of not being able to play sports without a B average. A lot of kids in our school have a C average. That would shorten the sports teams a lot and risk our chances of winning. Also, if kids aren't active it could cause health issues. Kids and teens now a days are not getting enough exercise.

Sports are what gives them the most of it. By taking away sports from people with anything lower than a B average, could be harming kids. If they don't have things to do out of school, studies show that they will turn to bad habits, like drugs or gangs. Another point, some kids have learning disabilities, and that could disable them from getting A or B averages, and they could be trying there hardest. Taking away sports from them could make them feel bad about themselves, and feel like they aren't good enough. Social reasons is another reasons sports shouldn't be taken away. A lot of friendships are formed on sports teams. Having friends is important in school. If one friend can play and the other can't, there friendship could go away because they don't have things in common anymore. Overall, sports are an important part of a kids life. Taking them away for having lower that a B average would be a bad idea. Please take what I'm saying to note. Thank you.

Please do not enforce the policy to not allow students to participate in extracurricular activities without a grade B average. Students should be allowed to participate with at least a passing grade. Also, not all students that like to play sports and participate in other activities are able to keep a B average. It would be unfair to not allow them to play because they don't have a B average.

Students should be allowed to participate with at least a passing grade. Some students that enjoy participating are not capable of maintaining a B average. Students want to go and have fun without having to worry about keeping a high grade. They might not be able to keep that high of a grade, but still have the skills, and behavior to participate.

Not all students will be able to maintain a grade B average. Even if they have a B, some students can not maintain it. Maybe they don't fully understand a subject, or miss a few days and there grade drops because of it. Are you just going to say they cant participate?

It would be unfair to not allow them to participate. Grades are one thing, but if they have the skills and behavior to do what they want to, grades shouldn't keep them from doing that. They should have passing grade, but not be required to have a grade B average.

I heard you were going to change the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I disagree with that because, most students in our school have a grade C average. I know that if you probably made the average higher to a grade B average then it would bribe students to do their homework and pay attention more in school and then, they would work harder academically if they wanted to stay on their sports team (i. e. volleyball, basketball, Lacrosse, football, etc.).

Since most students only have a grade C average, there wouldn't be very many students trying out or participating in school sports because they would be unable too.

If you want us to win, and have a trophy case filled with 1st place ribbons and trophies then, you should let the school policy stay where it is; at a grade C average. Most students that do well academically, most of the time aren't good in sports because, they may not have time to practice their sports. Also, most students that are poor in academics, they are good in sports because they have the time to practice, get outside, be active and exercise more too. So for the students are good in sports but poor in academics you should keep it to a grade C average, because kids need a an outlet to go to, have fun and get their mind off of things. I hope this helped you think about your decision.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter i have concerns about the policy you have for sports and extra curriculum. I think the policy you have isn't helping the students because if we want to succeed in sports we have to be able to play them. So i don't think the policy is good because if we don't have players to play then we won't have sports and we won't succeed.

I think if we the policy should stay the same like it was because a C is passing a class. I do understand that you want us to achieve and do our best but not everybody's best is a B average. I think we as students should be giving a chance to prove that we can do our best and our award should be able to play sports. I think if you change the policy more children would be less interested in sports. Also if we wanted to do extra curriculum activities i think we should be able to do it because its helping us in the areas we need help in so it would bring up our grades or help us later on in life.

I would like to change the grade average for sports. The change in grade average for sports is a B average. Most students who participate in sports have C average. The change for the B average is imperative and it will help students in many ways.

Many students can be in sports and still do good in school the change would be just to raise the it one grade higher. This can help the students and help them raise grades in their other classes. Having a B average can help kids work harder to stay in sports. If the students really want to be in sports or other activities then they will do what is takes to stay in the clubs or sports.

Activities need to be earned in some cases. There are many kids who are gifted with a certain talent. The thing is that you need to be doing good in school to do those certain sports or activities. When some kids are not right for that sport it does not mean that they can't do well in other classes, such as math, literature, and even maybe making history.

In conclusion I think that we should change the grade average to a B average. Having a C average can So that kids can do better in school and better in life.

As you may know many of our students are either against the decision of changing the grade average to participate in a sport from C average to B. Or they agree with you. In my opinion i think its unfair, because we already work hard to maintain a 2.0 to be in a sport we love. and now with you changing the grade average.

In my opinion i think that policy is unfair. Many students have a C average because they have practice and don't have time to study. If you were to put in the policy then you would probably lose half of the team or kids we try to study every hour there not at practice and get overwhelmed. Even some kids who don't play sports have a C so what makes you think kids on a team with less time to study can keep a B average.

I understand why you want to make that policy. You want your school to be recognized for having good grades but kids like to have fun. If you were to ask any kid about the policy even ones who don't play sports they would say wrong. Kids need exercise and to have fun if you put that policy then it would make a lot of kids mad and they would spend more time complaining then studying.

What I am trying to say is your only a kid once, so why spend your time stressing over playing sports and studying. so it would make the kids a lot happier if the school policy stays the same. If the kids drop below a C then they should not be able to play. So would you rather keep every thing the same or having kids complain for the next five months, its you choice.

It has been brought to my attention that you are changing the school policy to where you have to have at least a B average to participate in sports. I think that this is unfair it may be good in ways, but it also may be bad.

If some students didn't participate in sports then their grades may go down or go up. My personal opinion will be stated in the next few paragraph.

In my first paragraph is going to state why it is a bad idea.

In my second paragraph is going to state why it is a great idea.

My third paragraph is going to sate that it may affect our school.

Well I think it could be bad idea because some students may have good grades for the sports they play.

It may seem to them that it is unfair.

Me and a few of my friends have a C average and playing sports encouraged us to keep our grades up. If you could only play sports if you had a B average then maybe we wouldn't have enough people to play basketball or football. I know that if i couldn't play sports i would be heart broken.

It also may be a great idea because most people would try harder in school.

It could also encourage people to do their best to maintain a very good average in their classes.

it would let a lot of people be more focused on their school work instead of sports.

A reason it may affect our school in the population.

Most people would probably transfer to may other surrounding school because of it.

Or it may encourage more people to send their students here at SCHOOL_NAME.

Many students have a grade C average, which is not that bad for an average. A grade C average is still a passing grade. To many people, sports and other activities is what helps students get them through troubles that they may have at home. Many times, sports raise people's self esteem and that could be how they are passing even though it's just on the edge of a passing grade. It is very important that everyone has something that they can rely on to make them happy and feel like they are important. Some students think about their sports and activities when they need something to give them the energy to stick up for what they believe in and realize how important it is to make the most out of the life that you have. That happened to me. I joined band this year and I now speak from my heart and I try my best to treat everyone with care. My first day of band everyone was so nice to me and they helped and made me feel like I've always been part of the band and they included me in everything. That activity has taught me to be a caring person and make the most of what I can and not act like someone I'm not. So, please consider allowing students with a C average to participate in sports and other activities. Sports and other activities are not just something people do for fun but, also to help them become a better person, themselves. Thank you so much!

I understand your reasoning for the new change you would like to undertake, but I am against his issue. Many students in our school love to play sports, and other fun activities, but also many students are getting C averages or below as their grades. Kids that are doing so for example should not be restricted from school activities like so just because of their grades, the should be helped. A possible solution is requiring the child stay after school for extra help with teachers, or if that is not possible, encourage small help sessions in class. A child may not be the brightest in school, but may be the best on the basketball team. It is not fair to them to take away something that is amusing for them, or lets them have fun. Their struggling with school isn't going to change if you just take away more privileges. The child needs help. And what i believe may happen is sometimes the child will even start doing worse, or stop focusing as much because he/she is angry and sad they have no privileges other than to focus on their school work more and try harder. Most of these reasons are to occur if you take these activities away from children with averages of a C or less. On the other hand, if you start having after school sessions, then the child will start to succeed, and will be having fun participating in their activities. I greatly believe that this problem should be undertaken by these possible ways and strategy's.

2E655BA40E7D,"To the Principal of our school:

I am in no support of your idea of having a policy for sports athletes to have a B average.

We have done a survey that shows a majority of our students here at school have a C average, and some of those people are athletes. This will not help our school in anyway! We have a great athletic program but this is going to ruin it. I understand that schools promote a challenging learning environment but if they don't understand a subject and get a D or a F, they can't help that, and that means they're off of their sports team.

Students in our school want to play sports but if they are not a smart or gifted student, then you're just going to say, "" Well, too bad your grade point average is sub par and we just can not accept that so you can not be on the team."" If that were me I would first tell my parents, which they would be outraged, then they would be mad at you and the school, and eventually it gets worse and I really don't think that you want to go through with that type of problem, because I know I wouldn't.

Now I understand that it's the schools responsibility to challenge students to make them better and let them have more options and a better future, but if you will not accept them to a sports team, then that may hurt them into getting into a higher level sports team or a certain scholarship for a college or a university. If you go through with this act of a required minimum grade point average of a B, then you can hurt some of these kids futures. That would leave a bad reputation on our school and you. For myself, I love sports and this will make me work harder to stay on a team, which I am assuming is your goal in all this.

As a student with concerns on this revising of a school policy, I have some suggestions for you as in regards to how you could make more students happier. My first suggestion is change this to a C average because as I stated before, most students have a C average and this could help them in regards to boost morale in the school, or boost their self-confidence, also this could let super star athletes go into a sport and bring in trophies for the school and also bring a better look to the school in regards to athletics recently.

As you can see I am strongly against your proposed plan for athletic minimum grade point averages to be a B, and I have told you why myself and numerous other students at our school are very strongly against your revisions to that policy. But I have also provided you with an alternate solution that can help you, the students, and the school itself. So I hope that you can look at this letter very carefully and can make the students happier at our school.

They may have got an A in Math because they get math but a D in Science because they don't fully understand how the body works. Not every body is going to be smart. Some people are smart and others aren't to bright. Some people may be athletic but some aren't at all. Very few people are smart and athletic. Different people have different gifts.

If it is evident that they are trying in every class then they may just not get the material. Some people understand the most complex things but the easier theories just don't click in their heads. A lot of people have this problem and if they are going through an easy chapter and they don't understand but if they are doing most of their work it is evident that they just don't get it and maybe could use an extra hand.

If the majority of the students have a C average it might not be the students that have the problem. Everybody learns different but if the teacher only explains the material the same way over and over the students aren't going to get it. The teacher may have to look up other way to teach the material so it can click in the other students minds.

This idea of not letting students participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average is just bologna. Every students deserves the right to have a fun time with friends, get excersize, and be healthy by participating in a sport or other activity at school.

Athletic ability should not be based on smarts, because a person who is a fantastic athlete could be getting all C' s in their classes. Many kids only enjoy playing sports or being in school activities like school dances, fundraises, field trips, etc. Taking away these rights to the children with grade C averages and above is just plain cruel.

In my opinion every student deserves the right to be involved in school activities as long as they keep an above grade D average. Many students have a grade C average, but that is not their fault if that is the only grade they are able to get. If a student who doesn't have a grade B average wants to play a sport or join in an activity at school and enjoy it, wont be able to because of one class that is bringing their grade down.

If students have a grade C average or below, the school's job should be to help this student in getting better grades and keeping those grades.

I disagree with you that kids should be getting at least a B or better average to be able to participate in school sports. Everyone has there bad days and maybe does bad on a test, and gets a D, but just because they had a bad grade doesn't mean sports and other activities should be taken away and also a lot of kids don't like school but love sports or a activity ,so you shouldn't take that away from them if they get a C or below in a class.

My first reason that our school shouldn't change the grade average for students to get into sport or activity is because a lot of kids have a hard time with school, but love sports. I must say that I'm a sport lover also I do a lot of school activities, and get A' s, and B' s. But occasionally I do get a lower grade on a test or homework. And if your teacher doesn't give you a lot of homework, that grade can bring your grade down a lot! So if I have a bad test score and that brings me down to a C, I can't join the cheer leading squad or the writing club? That's not right.

Another reason I don't think our school should switch to a B average in order to play sports or join activities is that not all kids are school smart. Even though teachers are helping them they just don't like or have trouble in school, but that doesn't mean there not smart or good in sports! We all have different likes and dislikes, and those kids shouldn't get there like taken away from them just because they don't succeed in school.

You should just try to help the kids and try to bring there grades up higher. If they could not bring there grades up are try to i would make them take summer school. I think that the teachers should just be working harder with there school kids like with math are any school subjects they are having trouble with. If the kid is having trouble and still want to play sports they should just b able to play a sport lower. Some say that its not the students fault its there teachers cause they are not helping them that good. I think more kids would like school more if there teachers could help them a little bit more. No child should be struggling at nothing as long as if they have an aid are some one to help them with there school work they would be doing just fine.,3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I have heard that you are changing the school policy. That students may not participate in any after school activities without a grade B average. I would have to agree because of multiple reasons. That is that it would make students work harder at school work. Second, Many students do not pay attention to their school work more so than they do their activities. Third, The after school activities are great for your future, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't do good in school . I will explain why I think so in these short explanatory paragraphs.

First, Students with a grade C average will work harder to get a grade B average or higher. Those who want to participate in activities will not want to quit their club if they are really into it. They will try harder and be less lazy when it comes to school. They will be motivated. They will try their best to be in any sport or club they want.

Second, They will have no distractions. Because of after school activities, student are often busy. They often don't complete homework and often don't study. With after school activities out of the way, students will have time to do more things. Even though some fun is good every now in then, you shouldn't let it get in the way of more important things such as your future.

Third, School is a big part of their future. The students need to see this. Sure, you may want to do a school activity because you want some practice for who you want to be, but you need school to get you there. No good college is going to accept a C average student. Your future will be ruined.

So, as you can see, school is a big part in our lives. That's why I believe that you should change the policy. Students should be taught to not get what they want unless they give something in return. Their hard work and motivation. School will take them to their dreams. Sometimes, you must give up something to gain something.

Sincerely yours,

I believe that we should not have a B as a grade, to be able to try out for a sport. I know that you think were smart, but not every student is doing very well in there class. Now i have an c in two of my classes so that would mean that I wouldn't be able to try out for the sport i would like to play. Now if i was in your position i would announce that they would have to have a C or better to try out for any sport that we would like to play. Even though i like soccer i would get out my house and go to the park every two days, just to practice for this years soccer team coming up in March. Again if i was in your position i would add this rule if you were to change the grade thing. If any kids that were in a sport got into a fight, referral, or got in trouble in any way then they should be suspended a game each time they got in trouble. But if you were to keep that policy the way it is and you happened to see improvement from your students , then keep the rule the way it is. IT will not just be better for them ,but for the school district. Now TEACHER_NAME i would consider you to not change the rule and to keep it at a C average so we could have an enjoyable time at school.

4C3B693C4E52,"I am going against the school policy change about the sports grade participate because if most students have a grade C then many students will not be in the sports or other activities as much. Therefore, there would be no point of even having those clubs if like only a couple students will be in them. Plus, the grade C is at least passing, the grades D and F are not, making a reasonable statement why F and D students should not participate. There is not a very good reason why C students should not join, it is still passing plus the fact that most students have a C. If you allow grade C and up, the club/activities will have more students to join, if you do not have the grade C students, it will not be like a club.

For example, if only 5 people join for Basketball, then there really is not any point at all to go against another school's team who has 10 people, making no point to even join the club. If you add in the C students, for example, the Basketball teams will be even and the students will actually be able to go against another team, making it 10 students against 10 students. All in all, if you add the grade C students, there will be a even enough team, plus a opportunity to get active and encourage students to follow their dreams of being , for example, a football player, a Basketball player, or even want to be in the Olympics. If you do not add the grade C students, it will be like taking away their Lifetime wish/dream, which is not a very helpful thing to do as a principal.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

l am a student at your school and you have a argument that says if you want to play sports or do any other activities at school you have to have a B average in most of your classes. In this statement I agree with your decision because most of students want to say that when they go to school nobody is not intelligent. I would say that to my parents. In school most students do not take anything they do seriously, and do not realize what they are doing will only hurt themselves in the future. If students don't follow these rules that are set for them to keep school in order there will be consequences.

In order to set up a substantial school were every students care about what they are doing and learning each day they should realize that if the want to play sports or do after school activities they need a average grade of a B. I think this what you should do TEACHER_NAME because this will show students that they are not in charge. For example I go to school and I see so many students not caring about there work and just slake off. Even though this is something new like this idea there is always a way to try and get everything in order.

Some students enjoy playing many sports and like to do things that there parents don't let them do at home. They like to stay after school for an art project, or even a rehearsal for a play. These activities are very important to most students and they would not like to have this. I say that if they want all this they should understand what the proposal is that we are trying to send out. Even though some students will obviously disagree with this will help most of them. This is agreement that will show students what school is all about. Since most students will dislike this like I exclaimed there should be rules that you should set out that will set them straight. Some rules should say: if you fail a semester of classes you will not let you have a way out of not playing sports or do other activities.

I think that in this case no student should have a C range in school to follow this rule because if you do that no rules would be substantial, and that our school would be doing really badly. This would only help our school and only if you do everything will be fine. Even if you have a bad grade like a C students will learn to do better in school. Even if it means to work really hard and do extra work.

To conclude I think most of these students and there classes are very important to you. This idea may lead you to a spot were students test scores will be off the chart, and our school would be overcame. Through this most of the students will be upset, but this idea may change our school.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I think the new B

average participation rule would be great for most kids, because there are a lot of kids that are smart but don't apply themselves. Most kids think they can goof off and they still get the privileges as the other kids that actually work for the stuff they obtain.

Kids like to just mess around and not understand what it is there actually learning. Then when it comes test time they don't know what it is there doing. When the get homework they don't do it because they don't think it can effect them.

There are many kids that think all they'll need to do is pass with a D, and that they will move on but a D is only saying that they have the basics down, and they don't fully understand it. If they want to get into a good school they are going to have to start applying themselves.

If there is a grade cap on most school activities students will start working harder. The activities should only be for people that apply themselves and work hard so they can get into a good school and get the rewards they deserve.

Principle these are the reasons why we need a grade cap on school activities. So kids could work for what they earn. There's just to many kids who think they can get by in life with just a D or C for a grade.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

Sports and activities for a student is a good thing for them it relieves stress and helps them out with coping with things in life because it gives them something to do.

Yes, students do need to make good grades but sports, I believe, is not the reason most students are failing.

I know that playing sports is a privilege that not everybody deserves but moving the grades you have to make to a higher average to play sports that is just not right.

Some students need help and have trouble learning and may want to play sports and if they are trying to get that C so that they can pass and they tried their hardest then I believe that they deserve it because they have tried so hard.

Putting up the grade average is just going to cause less people in sports because some struggle to make an A average or even a B average because school is not as easy as everyone puts it out to be.

Yes you all are trying to make us smarter and make it to were going thru life is easier because we know most things is great but we are just humans everyone nearly is going to make a C or even fail something once in their life if not more and taking away a privilege for a passing C, I think is not right to do at all.

Hi my name is STUDENT_NAME and I am writing to you about the policy change you are going to make. There are many reasons on why you shouldn't change the policy but I am only going to name a few.

I know it is not good to have low grades but most of the students who have low grades love to play sports and without sports they feel they have nothing to do. Some students that are over weight and want to do something about it look to sports and if there average is a C then you are keeping them away from losing weight.

On the other side if a student with a C average wants to be in the Beta club or the Student Council then I say don't let them in because they do not deserve to be in it because they are leaders and leaders do not need to have low grades.

I think it is unfair to ask that students participating in sports should have a B average. Sports and other after school activities take a lot of time and commitment, and leave participants with much less time to study. Asking participants to keep up a B average would cause a lot of stress on the students. Many students who do not partake in sports have difficulty keeping grades high, and sports require after school practices and games. This leaves team members with even less time to do their homework and study. Also, a B average is a 3.0 GPA, which is nearly honor roll! A 3.0 GPA is something teenagers should aspire towards and work for, but not be required to achieve. Every student has his or her talents. Some excel at schoolwork, but others are outstanding in other fields, such as basketball, volleyball, or singing. Forcing students to keep their grades at such a high standard would cause late nights for many participants, who struggle to finish their homework daily. It means extra hours of studying and homework. It can be especially stressful on students high-level courses, such as Honors English and Social Studies or geometry. These students work hard enough in such classes and their efforts should be applauded, not looked down upon. A C average, while maybe not something to post on your fridge at home, still requires plenty of effort. Maintaining a C average is a reasonable standard, but keeping a B average is unattainable for some students and should not be required.

I think not letting students participate in sports and activities if they don't have a grade B average is a wonderful idea.

Even though most students at our school have a C average, this could benefit them.

For one thing, it would encourage them to improve their grades so that they can participate in the sport or activity that they want to.

Also, this prevents sports teams from having students who have an ""I can't"" attitude on the team.

Students would also be able to concentrate more on their sport or activity because they would be doing well in school.

School should always come first, which is exactly why i think your idea is perfect.

This way your not asking the students to get perfect grades, but instead to try their best and achieve a B average.

I believe that student should be allowed to play any given sport with at least a C average or higher. Some students may try their hardest to get even a C but it may be difficult for him\her. Also, some students may be able to succeed at least a B average. I believe it is a little unfair to the students that try their hardest but can only reach a see, therefore, I am against the situation. I believe that not only does it build good physical characteristics, but it also motivates students to academically succeed. Also, it may encourage students to share a positive attitude at school and at home with peers.

Not only sports even just regular school activities as well. Such as chess, robotics, yearbook staff, or even honor band. I believe that it will help those students with a C average to bring their grade up even further.

There are so many opportunities in school for students to do. I think students should be able to attend activities with even a D sometimes. Some students know what it takes to bring it up and school activities can help. It can be a hobby if students don't have one at home. Also it may give them something to look forward to on a bad day.

""The coach said i could've made the team, Joe.""

""Why didn't you make it?'

""Because of my grades.""

Too bad Bob couldn't make the team. He is so good in basketball but because of his

C he can't be on the team. Now how does that sound principal? He has so much talent and could lead your school to their first championship ever, but he has a C. Bob could have either was missing his assignments because he was having some family problems at home, or just not getting enough sleep. Mostly everybody has a C at school so who's going to be on the team.

Why allow students with C averages to participate in sports or other activities you ask?

Students are not going to be on the top of their class everyday. Even an A students slips up eventually, and if that student is in a club or on a sports team then they will be kicked off. How does that sound an a student messes up one time and gets kicked out of a sports team or activities.

In conlusion, a student with a C average doesn't mean that they are not smart. Maybe they are just struggling in one subject. When you allow kids with a C average to participate rthe sports team will win more.

I would have to agree with you that a B average is necessary to maintain a place on the schools sports teams and clubs. It is not only important that we show our rival schools how we excel at sports but academics as well. Although many of the ""star"" athletes may have poor grades it is important that they know it is a privilege to be on the team. A privilege that they must work for and honor. Clubs and groups are a privilege as well we should not allow them to join a club unless that club is study group.

While some people may find it hard to get a maintain a C average everyone is more than capable of excelling beyond that. I believe it is important that we focus on the intelligence of our students before we try to enhance them athletically Clubs such as photo, art, and drama are for fun and I guarantee their teachers are not having fun grading their papers. If they do not study for tests, ask the teachers for help when necessary, and get their work done I have no reason to believe that they should have the opportunity to represent our school at a sporting event or in a club.

On the other hand there are peers of mine in the school who are academically challenged while doing all of the techniques I listed above. With this exception I believe they should take two days a week from the practice schedule or club to be further assisted with this problem.

However, this is the only exception I would recommend. School comes first and students should learn this now rather than later down the road.

I would really appreciate you taking this letter into consideration. I not only demonstrated my opinion on this topic but a technique and exception as well. I am very happy to know that you agree and take these poor grades as seriously as I do. Your clear devotion to the students by making them work for such an honor.

I think we should change the grade requirements to B average. We're in Junior High School and the teacher's want the students to make Honor Roll or Principals Honor Roll. The coaches here and teachers are requiring students to have a B average to join any sport or activities. If they can't meet those requirements, they can not participate unless they bring their grades up. The coach for basketball is requiring the students have Honor Roll by the end of the quarter.

Students that go to this Junior High School, are meeting the requirements on being back on the school team or in any activity that involves students staying in school or after-school. For instance, the student council kids need to meet the standards on talking in the promotion. If they have anything below a B average, they can't speak in the promotion. If their grade is good, they can promote and talk during the promotion.

I think we should change the school policy from C average to B average. That's what I think the School and the School Board should do. That's a wonderful idea and we should do it right now. It's time to make changes around the School. This is the right time to start thinking about it.

Concerning the possible policy change, I feel that it is fair to only allow B average students or better into school sports and other activities. Good grades are far more important than a good football team. Would you rather attend the school with the good football team or the school that ranks among the top schools in your city in the category of education?

If a student really wanted to be on the school basketball team, he could easily place more focus on his school work as opposed to video games. A C average generally means you either have all C's or you have at least one D. How do you get a D unless you're not trying? If you're getting a D, you may as well be failing. I totally agree that students should not be allowed to participate in sports if they can't do what they were sent to school to do. You are at a school because you need to learn and learning should be a student's main focus.

For a student to complain that they have to do better in order to participate in school activities is just ridiculous. As a student, I go to school to learn. Sports and other extra-curricular activities are just fun things on the side. Why should I be allowed to play on the basketball team if I only have a C average? I'm sure there's another side to this argument but it's probably not a very good one. Academics are more important than athletics.

Many students would be unhappy with this new policy. Kids have been doing fine maintaining a C average in classes, for some students it may be even difficult to maintain a C average to participate in a sport or school activity and changing the policy to a B average requirement would make it even more difficult. The schools academic system is just as important as its student activity and sport system.

The school policy should be that in order to participate in a sport or any other school related activity student must have at least a passable grade or better which is a grade of a C or higher. I don't think that students need to be proficient or above in there classes to play a sport or participate in a activity, because most students have classes where they are good and some classes where they're bad and the students shouldn't have to be punished for that one bad class they have just because they don't have a B average. Changing a C to a B could be a big deal for some students so the new policy of a B grade average wouldn't be a good thing for most of the students in the school with a grade C average.

I hope the principle would leave the policy the way it is and not make a new one because I participate in a sport and having B grade average wouldn't be difficult but to many of my teammates it would probably cause them to drop the sport for certain classes that they have been doing well in but not well enough to have a B average to play a sport.

I am not a

A+ student and i don't always get As and Bs but i always try my hardest. I also like sports so that shouldn't stop me from playing. i am not saying it isn't important to do well in school, i am just saying that a C average shouldn't stop you from what you want to do. i would just not go below a C average because that just shows you don't try so if you don't try hard at school then why should you get to play sports.

Have you ever not studied so you could prepare for a big game?

Statistics say, 1/3 kids decide to practice their sport instead of study for a big test. That is why I think you should have a B average to be able to be on a team. When you have a B average that means you can manage studying and being on a team at the same time. Sometimes when you focus on something other than school it can distract you from what is really important. Also, if you set the average to B that is setting a goal for the students; to have good grades so they can play on whatever team they would like.

Many students at our school play on a team; almost half of our students average at a C or below. If every student had to average a B to play on a team, you would see almost half of the students grades go up. Just so they could play on their team. That would mean half of the students grades would be raising.

Raising the average would help about every student focus more on school. You would see improvement in a lot of students. When they focus, they do better, when they do better they are improving , and when they improve they can play on teams. Which is making the students able to manage school and teams.

This would make the entire school improve. Over half of the schoool would raise their grade point average because, they are trying harder so they can play on the team. The teams would also grow stronger because, the students would start learning how to manage their time. For example, from 3-4:30 i will study for my test and 4:30-6 i will practice soccer. This one choice will change our entire school.

Our school will grow stronger and better by getting each to have the average B to play on a team. better teams, smarter students, higher grade point averages, and a better school over all. please, put my opinion in mind.      ",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I send you this letter because i would like to discuss with you about changing the schools policy on not being able to participate in sport and actives unless you have a average of an A or B. I think this is wrong because so many children have problems with their work or might have a disability of learning, which cause them to get a lower grade.

children should have equal opportunities to participate in any activities or sport just so they wont feel as if they aren't worthy enough to do be successful just like every one else. If you do change this think about all the other children who are left out, they try just as hard as the rest of the children and it would be unfair to them that the aren't able to do anything, only being able to watch. I just come to you say that this is a very big mistake your making an i think you should see for your self how hard these children try and how hard it is for them to learn and be just like all of the rest of the children... Think about what your going to do before you do it. Most of the student only make C' s try to include them.

I could understand if they had only flawed grades which means their not trying hard enough but the ones who are should have every right to join in on the most fun they might ever have in a lift time. I myself have talked to some of the kids in school an they also agree with me not because they think its stupid but because they have bad grades them self's and are working as hard as they can.

The children of this school are wonderful and i wish you would just listen to what all of us are trying to say when i tell you that this is a wrong thing to do for the school and that you should listen to the kids opinions more often then not.

I mean just think about it usually students don't care, they just think ""Oh, Well I can play Football with whatever grades I might get."" Well If you make that brand new school policy you might see an extraordinary change in the grades for kids.

You might see students walking around school thinking about sports or other activities ,and that will be the only thing that they will be having on their mind. So, Instead of thinking about how to make sure you got your quiz right ,they will be thinking about their sports. Have you even ever seen a kid and a sport they love together? They are like glue. That is why we should just keep P.E. and that will be the exercise for the day! You don't have to think about no exercise if we have P.E..

If you make that school policy I am sure it will make a huge difference in our grade point average. I know that when I play a sport and I love I can't stop thinking about it and eventually my grades will just drop ,it is like I am a Leaf in the fall. Also, It isn't very pleasant going home and showing my parents my report cards if I failed any class. My grades started going up as soon as I had quit softball, trust me it makes a big difference in the grades.

I like sports, yes they are fun but you don't need them all of the time. A B average is a very good achievement for some students. It will be great to go home and show you parents you got all A' s and B' s. I love coming home and watching my parents be so proud of me , sometimes they even get me something to show me how proud they are.

So, as you can see getting A' s and B' s is a very good thing, and I can't wait to see the better grades, If you make that new policy ofcourse. Thank you for listening to me you will do a magnificent job choosing, I am sure.

Good luck,

That is why I will do my work so I can play sports to get a scholarship in sports.

The reason I like to play sports is to be able to tell my son one day that I played sports when I was in school so he would like to play sports when he gets in the 6 -12 grade.

We all love sports and participate in them, you changing the policy would altercate everything. The kids who don't participate in sports would be less motivated to do anything. And without physical ""works"" they would become lazy, tired, and even worse obese. For example, I have to do homework before I go to soccer.

It has come to my attention that you want to change our schools policy so that students cannot participate in sports or any other activity unless they have a B average.

My comment on that would be that most students in class have a C average therefore they wouldn't be able to be on any of our schools teams and if you don't have any students on a team then there wouldn't be a team at all. therefore you wouldn't have a sports department, now i know you care about the education of your students and there well being, but lets be reasonable, if there aren't any students at the extra activities such as, dances, games, fund raisers, etc. then we wouldn't have enough money to provide the school with the materials a school basically needs.

Now on the other hand i do realize and understand were your coming from TEACHER_NAME, some students don't deserve to go to extra activities or be on a team, but i think that if a student is on a team it will encourage them to bring up there grades academically and also students want to go to games and other fun things so i think that they wont just be going to school and doing things that bore them.

I would hate going to school knowing that there's a game later that same day and i couldn't go just because i had or had a C average.

Please do not change the school policy, many students have a C average. It won't be fair to the students that have a C average. If their isn't enough players that have a B average they won't be able to play the other team.

Not many student will be able to play if they have a C average. Many students will be disappointed if they can't play. Also many of the good players have a C average and if they can't play the team would probably lose. Many parents would be disappointed too if they see that their children is not playing.

6B5D04317738,"Dear principle TEACHER_NAME,

I am highly concerned student from SCHOOL_NAME. There is a big issue that your school has, and we would like you to fix it. The issue is our inability to take part in sports activities if we have below a B average. Many of the students including me think this is unfair to the students. One of the main reasons is that a B average is above average which is a C. Many of your students in this school have a C which is expected of most students and is considered passing therefore the grade expectancy should be lowered to a c avrage. You may not feel that would be good enough for your students but it is the average for all schools in the country and the average grade your students in your school are getting.

Another concern of yours may be that the students in the sports program may slack at school if you lower the grade level. I can assure u that will not happen.

Many of my fellow students at our school take pride in our school work and never get below a C-, I suggest if they do that they should get some source of extra studying or tutoring to be able to stay in the sports activities we offer here.

It is a good reason also to allow C ranking students in because it keeps students busy. With out the program there would be a lot of your students getting in to trouble . Such as joining gangs and doing drugs or getting into fights Sports is a good source of virtue to students my age. Its good to have values you may acquire from sports instead of us being juvenile delinquents from bad choices you do when you have nothing better to do.

B48302EAFB68,"Dear Principal,

Changing the school policy so that students have to have B or higher to participate in sports is a wonderful idea. Some students at our age do not understand that how we do in school is our future. By making this policy it will allow students to try harder in academics so they can have a bright future and participate in sports.

This policy allows students to realize that academics becomes before sports or having fun. Learning this important skill will allow students to focus on their academics and have a bright future when they graduate middle school or high school. In collage they will not have this type of determination to excel in something to participate in an activity so if they are determined to be apart in a school activity then they can learn the importance of doing well in school.

I believe all schools should make this a policy because many young adults plan to get into collage by a sports scholarships; yet they have no back up plan. With no back up plan and having not the best grades they can not get into a collage that they dreamed about. Many students have been in this situation and their future went down a drain. This is something no one wants to experience. If teachers start enforcing the fact that school is your future and you have to start planning now for it then possibly young adults will try harder to succeed in everything they do.

All schools should consider this policy for the well being of their students. Not all students have had the extra push in their life to know that this is their future and every major choice and action they make affects it. Schools having this policy gives students participating in sports that extra push. Teachers might also want to consider the idea of students participating in all activity's (not only sports), will have to get a B or higher in their classes. Also, they should hold a study time after school for anyone who needs help in their classes to give the students the idea that teachers want to see them exceed. Over all I believe this will affect students life in a positive way.

CA79F1AAB238,"Wow! That middle school in San Bernardino has a basket ball and soccer team and they all have C' s and D' s. A. Our school should have sports teams because it gives us a chance to demonstrate our athleticism. It also helps us meet friends from our school we didn't even know were here. It might even give us a chance to win trophies for the school.

The first reason is that it helps us show our athleticism and keep us in shape. If the school decides to band sports, mostly all the kids will have to be sitting down in a chair trying to get a higher grade. This will cause Americas youth to not be in shape and not have any physical activities in school. Even the famous people in the world didn't have good grades while they were in school.

Another, reason is that we meet new people from different schools or even from ours. While the school is traveling the city playing different schools we meet new kids and play as a team to beat them. When we win it also gets us closer to winning a trophy. This year we didn't even know the basket ball team and now every body knows them. Almost the whole school goes to see them play in games away from here.

Principals and teachers think they will save money on banning the sports to lower level kids but they are wrong. They will still have to pay for the people that are still on the team for uniforms and sport balls to play with. If the principal doesn't change any rules they will pay as much for the whole team than just half of it. This will decision would make the school loose money instead of gain, because they would have bought basket balls and other sport accessories and wouldn't even use them.

D6105DFE6379,"Dear Principal,

I have been informed that you will be changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. I agree with this idea since it will motivate students, and raise the GPA.

Schools have pep rally, and parties to motivate students to perform better on assessments, but by changing school policy to a Grade B average then they will have a motive or objective to reach for the goal to do better. This is why you should raise the policy to have a B average.

By increasing the policy to have a B point average to participate in sports then student will be more progressive increasing the school GPA and overall goal for the school increasing the chance of being one of the highest school in the district.

Some people may say, that the school is expecting to much out of the students. Well they are wrong. To participate in sports is a privilege that should not be abused. Some of the best player took education more important than shooting a ball.

In conclusion, the idea of changing school policy is indeed a great one not only for the school but for the best for the students overall. Now take this information and use it to make your decision on if school policy should be changed.

I don't get the point of letting students play sports or other activities when they have at least a grade B average. The tests that the student are taking are more harder and many people have at least a grade C average. A lot of students are unhappy of your decision of the sports and activities. I am absolutely against this decision principle. You can't decide what we do just because you are the principle of the school. Some of these decisions have to be based on the decision of the students. I don't think you know this but students have rights too. We have the right to protest if we don't like it. I mean a grade of a C is still average. To me, if the student has a D or an F on there grades, that is when I think is going to be a problem. They should be the ones that shouldn't play sports or any other activities. Let me ask you a question principle: Do you really want to do this? Do you really want to jeopardise the other activities just because a student has a grade C average. I will give you time to think about the questions that I just gave to you. The decision that you will make after some time will reflect us participating in these sports or any other activities related to the school. But if you make the wrong decision all the heat will be on you, not on the students. I'm not trying to force you to change the decision, but to inform you about what may happen if you make a wrong decision. Again, the student will give you time to change your decision about not participating in sports or other activities due to a student not having a grade B average or not. This is just to inform everyone if you made the right decision or not.

BAC97C094725,"Preparing for the future is something everybody needs to do. With the right rules and restrictions during school, students may be pushed to their full potential and even learn life lessons! I agree with my principal and this policy that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. Students must be well-rounded and prioritize their time well; and educations should always come first because it is the foundation for everything.

If this policy was permitted, it would ensure that education is the top priority. In planning for the future, colleges look for well-rounded students with good grades; if you are exceptional in another activity, that only helps more. You may be excellent at a sport, but if you get injured or just get old, what else do you have? Education stays with you forever, so that is the most important thing - especially when you are a kid and still growing and learning. If you have education as the foundation for all your other activities, how could you go wrong?

By activating this policy, it would also push students to work harder and set goals. A lot of the time, students don't really care about working as long as they have fun. People need to set goals in life in order to get things done. If you have nothing to work towards, what motivation do you have? If you really love a particular activity, but you don't have good grades, you would need to recognize the fact that you need to set a goal and work hard to get to that point. Setting goals and working hard are lessons kids need to learn in order to live as adults. The harsh reality is that students need to seize the opportunity to work hard so they can achieve their goals in general - and this policy would help them learn that.

Using this policy would also push students to prioritize their time. Bad grades are usually because students prefer doing other, more fun activities like watching television or playing video games. You don't really come across many kids doing homework for fun. But if students know that they would need at least a B average, they would start to plan their time more efficiently - a skill crucial to adult life.

""Shoot the for the moon. If you miss, you'll land among the stars."" This quote by Mark Twain, I think, fits this prompt appropriately. Education is key to life - if you have a special activity or goal, but it doesn't work out in the end, you will always have education to back you up. Having an education opens up so many doors in life! I fully support this policy in the knowledge that it would push students to set goals, prioritize time, and work hard to achieve them.",5,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8
5D3043E01B62,"I think that the kids our age would be very disappointed to be kept from playing the sports selected for our school. Mainly because that most of the kids in the school don't have that opportunity at home. they don't have a tennis court, or a golfing range, a basketball court, nor a pool. In my opinion, i think we are very lucky to have the option to play the sports we like, or think we can be very good at because then later on in our college recommendations there would be no sports selected. See, for kids our age we look for electives we think we can be good at, or already have an act for. As like a side dish before going home to cooking, cleaning, babysitting, etc...

In my opinion i like tennis and basketball. I am on the bentwater tennis team, but they don't have a basketball team. That's why i tried out for the team last year. But this year i need to focus on my art, so I've given up basketball for this year and throughout high school I'm taking tennis for the team. And i don't think its fair to have kids have at least a grade B to participate in sports, cause my true opinion is that kids now, want to focus on their electives, mainly because its the side dish that they picked, knowing they HAVE TO have history, algebra, language arts, and science. But when their in that class they actually desire it gives them the perseverance to try harder in their other subjects. So if they don't have a B in a class, lets say its a C, so what? Eventually with the help that's required, i think it should be eligible for them to take the sport. Give them a reason to try harder in the sport, and in class. Lets just say that if they want to keep taking that sport, they have to go to tutoring twice a week, or three times a week. Plus some kids, need a way to cope with all the drama going on at home, or the bullying between other kids.

Some kids get bullied because of their weight, their clothes, anything, or maybe its just because the kids bullying them are just jealous. But the kids that are having to deal with that, need a way to get away from it all. In athletics it can be just running to let out your frustrations, or swimming just to cleanse your body of all the weight put on you at home, or tennis, just to wack the ball as hard as you can across the court to let out your anger. See in some way we all need a way to let out our emotions that we have bottled up inside of us. Me? My way is art. I've drawn so many things that i bet you cant even recognize, they might just be blobs of stuff, or skulls, or maybe even flowers, roses, happy faces, rainbows, when I'm happy. There is a way for everyone to let out their frustrations, and most people resolve those issues with sports. So i honestly don't think its fair for you to take away the sports academic program, let alone make us have the grades to get in. In some way, the grades we make are our choice, and you don't have us have all B' s to get into any other elective, why sports? And if you pass this school policy, i will bet you that there isn't gonna be as much kids as there would be even for just a team.

You can ask any kids that goes here, and i will be you 99.9% of them would say this policy is unspoken for, not fair and probably agree with what I've been trying to explain with this letter of recommendation. So now that i think i have gotten my point across, and you can actually see where im coming from im going to close this letter with a few words of my opinion.

I think that making kids get a B average is a wonderful idea. We need to get our students who have C's to pick up their grades. There is no need for a C student to have a chance slack off in school even more. If they can't try hard enough to get a B or better what makes us think that they could try hard in a sport. Not to mention our school would have a better and smarter program. i even think that we should expand our limits.

Our school could have better representation if we make them have better grades. Our programs would look like they are wonderful. Our school needs to be a great one. We may not be the best but if we have our students get good grades then we could have a great school. Our DBA scores could go up and our skills could evolve more if we learn faster and more efficient. In fact we'd get hard workers. If they are slacking off in school its because they don't want to do anything they are lazy and that is not a good sign of being a good athlete.

I think we nee to extend to other schools, too. If we were to talk to other principals then maybe we could in fact have our whole state represent better as a whole. If the schools look better then our state looks better which makes our government look better. In general by doing this we can make a huge difference in our economic system as well. With our kids learning and becoming hard workers then we can have more of several things in the job world. We would have more jobs coming form our future generations. If you think about it we can make this a better future just by getting athletes to work harder in what they do.

Do you want your students being lazy and non-active? Of course not, u want your students to be well active and fit. Nobody wants their students to be lazy and unhealthy. I bring this up because it has come to my attention that u want to change the schools policy so that students may not be able to play school sports or activities if they do not contain a B average. In my opinion I believe it is not a good idea and may need more thought put into the idea.

My first reason for going against this idea is because most students contain a C average in school. Students don't only want to play sports because its fun, but also because its what they love. Imagine someone takes something you love away from you because you didn't meet their expectations. Well you are doing the same to students. If most students average a C, it ok because they still pass. It might not be the best grade in the world, but its a passing grade.

My second reason for going against this idea is because it will not make students happy. Students like to get comfortable in the policies that their school has. What if your job kept changing your salary, whether it was good or bad. Would it make you happy? Students cant adapt to their school policies if they keep changing. If the schools policies keep changing students will become furious with having to fit in with the policies. If a policy goes against what a student stands fore that students has to change who he or she is and its like starting a new life and most children don't want that.

My last reason for going against this policy is it would not benefit the school. If the scholars in this school had to maintain a B average to play sports, that's like taking half of the school and telling them they cant play any school sports or activities. Imagine the things that people will say about the school. Nobody wants someone else to put a name on them. People will dislike the school for its policies and soon the town will have its own name, in a bad way. Taking half of this school and telling them they cannot play sports is like cutting a employees salary in half because of his race.

As you can see i am a hundred percent against this idea for changing the schools policy on sports and activities.

Imagine you are a student in this school what would you want. As the principal don't you want the best for our school and for the students?

Some of the reasons i say its a bad thing is that there are some kids out there that use sports as there life long dream but now that they cant do as good as they want to in school and that puts them in a position where they cant play or interact with these other activities, but some people also use sports to push themselves in school just to play in other activities and sports. Also some more idea's that first pop up in my head is that some kids play sports with D and C and still play in other activities they could just stop doing the other activities, and sports that they have been doing.

Some good reasons why this could be a good thing, one way that this could help the school out is having these kids that play sports and interact with other activities. Is that when they're doing these sports and other activities they can know that there doing this with good grades and that is one good thing about it. Then also it also can get the pressure off you because you now that you are going to have to show a report to some every week, and you know that you have a b or better.

So what do i think is that this policy about having a better grade to be able to play in sports and other activities is smart for the school but not so fun for the students and not saying that its good to have a D or C in your class and put that pressure on yourself.

I am aware of the changes you would like to make but on my point of view i think it will be unfair because some kids try there best to get a B or A but it's pretty difficult. Sometimes the students try and try but they steal get a C

and its just because there test scores, not on how they do there work or on there behavior.

I think that you should let the kids with a C average work there self's up till they get a B or A

i steal think the kids with a C are not so bad so let them participate.

What i think would be fair is if you wouldn't let the kids with a D or F average participate on sports or other activities. I think kids with a average of

D or F show that they have a poor average & they don't want to participate.

Your consideration of changing the school policy so that students may not participate in any sports or in any activities unless they have at least a grade B average, in my point of view I think that all students should be able to participate in any sports/activities once so ever. You changing the school policy could cause many problems with the health of the children that don't have a B average or above. It can cause health problems because the children will become inactive, meaning that they will become lazy and not care for there own health. They might eat more than they usually do, eating more junk food than their fruits and vegetables. That can increase their weight and can increase the chance of a heart attack.

I also think it's unfair to let other students play while the other students watch them and sit inside doing work. But in the other hand the students that do receive a B average or higher should deserve a little price saying ""good job"" for their hard work and effort. And for the students that don't receive a good average, I think their teachers should try to motivate them to try even harder to boost their grades up, and when they do get to a B average or higher they will receive a prize too like the other students.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is that changing the school policy so that students may not participate in any sports or in any activities unless they have at least a grade B average or higher, is unfair and unhealthy to the students. Let all the students of the school participate in sports so that they can be active at all times, motivate the students to get better grades in school, and also by saying ""Good Job!"" with a smile and a small prize.

I think that the new policy is unfair to the students who love to play sports but can't get a ""B"" average.

I know some of those people who have a hard time and I know that they are trying really hard.

They are really disappointed with the new policy and are sad because they won't be able to play sports anymore.

I can also understand why you decided to make this policy because a lot of people are focusing more on sports than their school work.

Sports are an extracurricular activity and you should have good grades to be able to do them.

School is more important than sports because most people aren't going to be a professional athlete.

I can see that you are trying to influence them to do better in school but some of them just don't have the attitude to want to try hard at school.

They think that they can't do it, so some of them will just quit trying all together.

Another problem with this is that there are a lot of people who don't have a ""B"" average.

This is a small school and there might not be enough people to have a sport team.

This would disappoint me because I have an ""A"" average and I want to be able to play on this team.

There are some people who like to watch the games but won't be able to if there isn't a team.

Since a ""C"" is still a passing grade in our school, you could make it where you have to have a ""C"" average or above to play sports.

This way kids still have to have a good grade to play sports, but this grade is easier to achieve.

Whatever you decide I will respect your final decision.

I understand that you wish to change our school policy regarding requirements for sports. Now I know that we have many wonderful students who are tremendous at their sport and they made a commitment to have a C average or above. Raising the requirements to a B average would make them try harder, but some would give up because they think its too hard. Having smart students who participate in sports would be quite interesting but what about our star Football players, Basketball players, or Cheerleaders who have a C average and have to give up something they love. Now I know I wouldn't want to give up my sport because of my grades, and i know you love watching our teams win. And if every athlete who have a C average quit their sport then we would have very few athletes in our school and a less likely chance of winning our games and that wouldn't be first-rate now would it? Our students have fair grades but I do admit they could be better, I believe we should recommend B averages instead of enforcing a ""law"" about them. Other than sports there are the OTHER_NAME, Beta Club, and Art Club. If we raised the requirements for the grade average then some students wouldn't be able to participate in these clubs, and it would be a pity if we had to lose very important members of our clubs. Why raise the Grade average when it is fine the way it is?

I just want to let you know my opinion about not letting student who have less than a C in their grades participate in any of the activities. I think that it is right that you do that rule in our school because if you do, it might help the students understand that it is really important that they have good grades.

This may help the students but not only them it might help the teachers to. I think this because it will help the teacher because they will have more interest in teaching us the students because they will know that we may attention and not that we just play around in class. It will help the students because they will know that if they try hard to bring their grades up they will be able to participate in the activities.

So, I really think this will help us so that we may attention more to our grades. I think that this is important because I personally think that my grades are important to me and to my family.

Some kids aren't as smart as others, but are better at sports than them by a mile! Sometimes, when someone is feeling stressed out, they'll go shoot hoops or kick a soccer ball around. Sometimes it's the only thing they can do to relieve stress! and if they can't do right after school with their friends, just because of one bad grade, that's lame. Maybe they have a C average because they got one bad grade on a test because they spaced out on it. Big deal! They can make it up in the next week or so.

If they're in the chess club, same thing. Let's say a team goes to nationals one year because of one kid. And the next year, that kid gets a bad grade. There can be no exceptions to the rule so if you want him back on the team, you're screwed.

One time i have been in the same situation when i was failing math, it took me a lot of time and hard work to pass that class to play football for my school. there is a lot kid who plays around with the class because there of their sport or activities, that they don't try at all on pass their classes. i kindly ask you to change policy of getting B grade to C grade, so the kids have little hope on their studies and play in sports too.

A lot of students think that sports is better that studies and just try their hard sports and then goof around in their class and only try to get C grades and then they can still play. this why that policy came up but there a lot students who try very hard in their sport and class. we must think about them how hard the struggle to pass a class that hard for them.

I believe that this rule should be in affect.

I believe that grades should come ahead of extra curricular activities.

I think that students should have to have at least a grade average of a B to be able to do what they want to do.

Grades will affect you for many years to come.

Things like sports and such will affect you for your whole life also, but your grades will affect wither or not you play sports.

For example, if a person wants to become a professional athlete, to achieve that goal, they have to have good grades, and be able to play that sport well.

If they can play that sport well and don't have good grades, they wont be able to make it to college to be able to play that sport.

I am in band myself, but with band, I am also able to maintain a B as my grade average.

But some people don't care about their grades, they just care about the sports.

What they don't realize is that to be able to play that sport professionally, they have to make it to college.

In order to make it to college, they have to have good grades.

In order to have good grades, they have to put the grades before the sports.

If they really care about their career as a professional athlete, they will also put a lot of effort into their grades.

If someone has a below B grade average, they obviously don't care about their grades.

They just come to school to play sports and hang out with their friends.

I think this rule should have gone into affect a long time ago.

So as you can see, I believe that this rule should be put into affect very soon. It will not only affect their future and their lives, it will also affect the lives of others around them.

With most kids having a C average it would be unfair for the students that love to play sports. Even with a B average it would become difficult to have a success at college, but with a C average, and good at sports the chances for a scholarship increase greatly. Sports also greatly helps kids with everyday lives. It teaches them teamwork which helps in projects for school and helps kids get along.

Other activities like debate, ROTC, and fine arts greatly help a students learning by teaching outside of school. Without clubs, school to students would become more boring and they would feel like they have to go to school instead of wanting to come to school. With that in mind, if school becomes too boring the students might stop trying and instead of C averages you'll have D and F averages.

All or most of the students like to be involved in a lot of things and do something that they enjoy doing or like to do.

I think that the students with average of a grade C should be able to participate in sport and other activities. Students with grade C should be able to participate in sport and activities, because C is not bad of a grade! It is still considered as a passing grade in all the grades. If most of the students have a grade C as an average and they wouldn't be able to participate in sports or activities, then there will be almost no students involved in anything! I think that activities are not the distraction for students not to study very well to get a B, it is most likely they don't want to or just spend time doing something else out of school.

If the students wouldn't be able to participate in school sports or activities they are more likely to go and do things out of school, and be involved in something else as well. All the kids like different activities and I think that they should have an opportunity not just study everyday, but also have some fun and do different things to prepare them for their future. When a student would only be allowed to study and not to participate in anything else they wouldn't have any time to have a break or to relax from a long day that they had in school.

Students participating in sports and activities helps them take down the stress that they might of had in school, with friends or in a family, by doing sports or being involved in other activities and being able to communicate with others. That takes their mind of something that had bothered them.

Then if they get their grades up they'll be like ""hhmmmm"" maybe getting good grades isn't so bad after all.

I mean think about it good grades + sports or other after school activities= success. Students will be more likely to succeed in life. They'll also be proud of themselves for setting and achieving a goal. It'll also look good on their college applications. I mean either way, whether students have to have a B or C average it'll look good, but a B average and sports will look great.

I feel that you are partially correct in this situation. Students shouldn't be able to play school sports if they are not doing well in school . I say this because playing for a school team is a privilege. Academics always come first, they are more important. You will most likely not succeed in life if you do not do well in school. Also, if the students are not doing well in school and they still play sports, they will not learn the lesson. That is why students shouldn't be able to play school sports if they are not doing well in school.

The one part you are incorrect is when they should be penalized. They should only be kicked off the team if they have a failing grade, not a ""C"".

I think that it should be at least a B grade average to participate in sports because when you try to get into college they will not except C average. Plus if the student really wanted to play sports they get a B average. And that would be better for us in the future when we are trying to get into college. Don't in college they look at your grade from the past years to see if you qualify for what ever college you are trying to get into.

A B grade average is not really hard to get if we pay attention and do all of our homework and assignments. And in high school the coaches for the sports teams want students to get at least a 3.5 grade average so if students get use to having a b grade average then when they get in to high school they will already know what they have to do if they want to plat sports. There are probably students who already have B grade averages so it won't make a difference to them.

If most you know that most kids have a C grade average and you want to change the policy then all the students that have below a B grade average should have to attend a after school program.

We as students feel that your new rule that students must have a B average to participate is very unfair. First of all, the majority of the students have a C average. If you were to only let students with at least a B average to play sports, then there would be a drop in the students participating. The few people who do have a B average or higher will join the teams or clubs, but the people who have a C average, who are also the majority, will be excluded.

Second, there are all different kinds of people in the world. Some of us have different strengths and weaknesses. The students who may not do very well in school might be fantastic at football or soccer. As growing young adults, we need to be taught to find our natural talents and use them to our best abilities. By excluding students with a lower grade average, you are telling them, in a way, that they aren't good enough. You are telling them that even though they might have talents that are related to physical activities, they cannot put those talents to use because they don't do well in a certain area.

You shouldn't create rules without learning the back stories of the people it would be affecting. Say there is a student who is alright in all their subjects, a straight B student, but then they fail a math test, bringing down their grade. Now he is unable to join the soccer team, something he had been looking forward to all year. This student is not a slacker, he isn't lazy or rude or disruptive. There is a stereotype that kids who get bad grades are dumb and unwilling to do work. We see them as barbarians, the kids who sleep in class and talk back to the teacher. But the student who failed the math test, he wasn't a bad kid was he? He could have failed that test for multiple reasons; there could have been an accident at home so he couldn't have studied properly, his teacher could have ignored his questions, leaving him confused with the material.

People are sometimes unable to be perfect at everything. Students with disabilities may still be trying their hardest but may end up with C average. So I see it as very unfair and insensitive to make a rule without reviewing the conditions of the students.

The kids will be angry and tell their parents, resulting in many calls to the school or even protests and students being transferred to a different school. The students who get lower than a B average may feel passionately about sports, and I feel that it will cause much unrest in our school community to just swipe the opportunity to shine away from them.

In other cases, I enjoy doing sports and such, but sometimes slip into a C average and need to bring my grad back up. Sports and after school actives are fun and helps students make new friends with the same interests and the activities students can join are enjoyable to the all kids who join them. Sports are good endurance builders, are good exercise can help some kids from becoming obese. There are many reasons why they are good for students.

Even though there are many good things about after school sports and activities, kids need to go to school and get an education. Getting an education helps a person become more well rounded and lets them experience new things that will help them later in life.

Your new policy about sports and other extra-curricular activities is a very good plan.

However, many students will not benefit from this plan.

Most of the students have a C average, and if you put your policy into effect, they may not be able to do many after school activities.

Though your policy will encourage students to strive for good grades, it may not work.

You would be taking away opportunities for them to broaden their horizons and grow to their full potential. I am writing to advise you against this new change in the policy.

Many students enjoy the sports and clubs that they are able to participate in.

However, if you change the policy, students with a grade average below a B will not have this opportunity.

Therefore I do not agree with you changing the policy.

Students will not be able to do some of the activities provided to them.

This would not be fair to the majority of the student body.

One specific reason I do not support your new policy is because many students try their hardest, but simply just cannot maintain a B average.

If you were to take the average of all of the grades of the entire student body and average them together, you could make that the requirement instead.

That way all of the students have a goal that they can actually achieve.

Plus, they have a reward for maintaining their good grades.

Though your policy would encourage students to keep good grades, there are some students who just are not able to maintain a B average.

Many students enjoy the opportunity to expand their horizon and learn new things.

Nevertheless, if the policy is changed, that opportunity may be taken away from some of the students.

Then they would not have a chance to grow and learn new things.

Isn't that what school is supposed to be all about?

Learning new things, taking chances, and making the best of you opportunities?

If you change the school's policy on extra-curricular activities, how will they ever achieve that?

Students need to have a good academic standard, but they also need to have a chance to grow and explore new things. With a change in the school's policy, many students may not have the chance to explore the world and discover who they are.

Sports and clubs provide a good start for students to discover what they are good at, and then take it one step farther and discover what they want to do with their life.

If they do not have the opportunity to discover this, then what is the point of sending them to school?

School is supposed to provide a way for students to do something with their life, and if they do not know what they want to do with their life, then what will they do in the future.

People need a way to prepare themselves for what lies ahead, and if they don't know how to deal with it, then their lives could be changed forever.

I have heard from some of my friends that you wish to change school policy so that all students hoping to participate in a sport must have a B or above as there average. Even though that may bring up a few student averages I must disagree with your point. Here's why...

Firstly, I would like to point out the students that are week in core classes like Math and English and need to use sports as a gateway to there future such as college or maybe even getting a job. These students will have more trouble in their future if they don't have something there good at and can excel in such as sports.

Secondly, what will happen to the students who give up after hearing they must maintain a B to be in sports? Some students have to try hard to maintain a C. What would happen to them? A lot of them will most likely stop trying altogether now that they've lost motivation.

My final point is that I think the current policy work fine. While I disagree that students must have a B average, I think maintaining a C is nothing short of reasonable. Student who are getting failing grades are obviously not trying and there isn't really any excuse for that.

Your not failing or about to fail so there's no point. You should base it on how they do in class and how they act up. you should also see if they act up during the program. You should not look at their grades if they are higher than a C because that person could be gone for along time or the teacher will be gone for alone time.

Not all students can maintain a B average. If you change the school policy. You will probably have less Extra Curricular activities and less students wanting to come to Everglades High. The football team will probably have to quit knowing that you will not accept any other grades. Plus, not all teacher faculty curves grades. I'm not even able to keep up a B average all the time. Most parents cannot pay money for a tutor. Tutoring isn't cheap. So, you might want to think twice before you change the policy. It would also mean less sports agents coming to the school. Even if they are here to see students that are keeping up the average.

Most children come to your school because of the sports and other multiple activities in your school. If you take it away nobody would be coming here cause they want to. But, because there forced to. Kids need freedom and most of theirs are the schools activities. Taking that away would be like taking away their future, passion, and hope. It helps them keep believing in things. Even if that thing is maintaining a C average. Think twice before you get laid off. It's probably not everyday that someone is trying to tell you how and when to do the right thing or job. But, I am telling you now, and like it is. Minors will be miserable knowing that they get kicked off a team for a C. Then everybody would give up hope on you too.

TEACHER_NAME, Don't change the policy because you think it's right. You should be thinking about who's life your going to mess up. If you make the policy to the point were everybody needs a B. Nobody is going to have a passion anymore. Weather it's art, football, cheer leading, or Chess club. It's what their life reflects on.

If this rule is pass there would be very few students playing sports because the would not be allowed to because of their grades are not meeting the goal that they are supposed to meet to join an after school activity or a sport.

These students do not deserve this decision because if their grades do not meet the standards that they need to join the team that means they will not be able to play the sports they love for their school. I think that you should have the grading standards at least be an C+ so their not in average they are in an high C category so they will be able to play their sports they enjoy doing and still be able to make good grades so there is a smile on the students face as well as the school boards.

It will Also lead to another major issue student that do not join the team leads up to no players in the game so then our school will not be able to participate with a basket ball games, football games or any other sports or after school activities that our school represents. I understand where you are coming from with raising the grading scale for sports because you want to help these students succeed in life and want their Grade Point Average to stay over a three point zero but some students just can not succeed in this expectation.

To have to be able to have a B average to play or participate in sports is not fair in my opinion. Some people love to play sports and enjoy the opportunity to participate in these events. I would have to argue to the fact at least the students should have to receive a C to participate in these sport events because some people try there hard to the best of there ability to be able to get good grades to be able to play the sport that they want.

I have an experience of mine on that I have had a C and tried my hardest to get it up. Sometimes I even stayed after school to get the grade that I needed up. I love the sport that I play and would be extremely upset if I could not participate in the sport I wanted to play. I would personally from experience be very upset. I would hate to see other people not be able to do the sports they wanted to . I also think the school without sports or fun activities would be a boring school because there would be no excitement for the game after school. There would be nothing to look forward to. There would be no talking in classes and the teachers would actually have silence. The teachers would maybe be happy but then be sad cause the students are upset.

That is my opinion on why we should at least have a C because a C is still a passing grade. There should still be sport activities in the school because it makes everyone happy and gives them something to look forward to throughout the week or even on weekends. They also give a lot of confidence in the world to me because you cheer on your friends to do a good job. It is a fun advantage in school and I think we should not change it and keep it the way that it is way.            ",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I believe that only allowing students with a grade B average to play sports is wrong and unfair. This is because without sports, students will lose their hobbies and it can get in the way of sporting careers that they may want to follow. Students can also get scholarships for sports which can help a lot if they're not strong in other subjects.

Some students only like one thing. Sports. If they can't do the one thing they enjoy they may give up in school which will only lower their grades. Banning sports from the majority of the school might also lead the school to forfeit their games because they might not have enough players to play the game.

Another reason why this rule is unfair is because maybe a student is aiming to get a scholarship in college from their athleticism. This is because they want to go to college to get a good job but might have a hard time making it because they aren't doing so well in school. Therefore, students start sports to go to a good college.

To achieve a good sporting career, many students start on school sports teams and gradually get better and better at the sport they love. If students aren't allowed to play on the sports team just because they have an average grade in school they can't follow their career of choice and they might end up with a job that they do not enjoy.

As you can see, banning sports from the majority of the school can lead to students lowering their grades and the school forfeiting their games. This also takes away the rights of students. This rule should not be made because it is unfair to most of the students.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I agree with the decision to change the C average to a B average to be eligible for any extra curricular activities, because it may increase the over all effort of a schools performance. It may even be a step to encourage more effort in the classroom, and of the person themselves to be a better person.

Changing the school policy might result in viewer students trying out for sports or other extra curricular activities. There might be an increase in a students effort in school to do better, due to the fact if they do not have the required grades, they may not join any activities. I believe that grades might even improve in the overall class average. It may also help to encourage more students to do extra curricular activities that can motivate students to do their best in school. It may even be good to encourage this now by keeping their good grades, so that later in life they may

Changing the school policy might serve as a motivator to other students, to do better in school. To get the best effort out of any student, you require a very good motivator. Sports or other activities that might help their future, will get more students to do their best efforts. It will especially help those students if the motivator is something that is fun and if it is something they love to do.

It will be very good to change the policy because it will bring out the best of ever student to do better in school.

Today, we talked about changing the school policy to where students have to have at least a B average. I don't believe that is right, the basketball team is already short of people if you were to change the policy we probably would not have enough people of one team. Also, student have the right to have a C, it is not failing. I am here to speak for the basketball team and soccer team.

I state that we do work hard on our grade and have our heads in a book. I believe we can work harder to get most of our grades to a B average. Before, you agree to this policy i believe you should strongly suggest reconsidering this strong demand. If you do say all students must have a B average then you might not have enough people on any sport except track an tennis.

Therefore, we did not even have a soccer team an now that we get one it might be cut in half. Then there will after a while there might not even be any sports. So, by the time the kids get to the high school they will not have learned anything (sports wise) which will bring the sports ranks down a Duncanville high school.

Kids today are playing sports because they want to have fun and maybe even loose some weight. Many of these kids must maintain a C average in order to play the sport in which they are participating. However you are trying to make it a requirement to have a B average in order to play sports. This is wrong and unfair to kids who play sports and can only maintain C average.

You ask these kids to earn an B average, which means above average, and yet they can only earn a C average. If a student earns an C average that means they are still passing their classes and are an average student. Now I know you may say that a student should try to be better than average and study a little harder in order to earn B average and to play sports. However some kids study every day as best as they can and still earn a C average which is passing. These kids should not be forced to be above average if they are only average.

Kids today play sports sometimes in order to loose weight. If these kids earn a C average and cannot play the sport they want to play then they will become obeast. You can disagree with this statement because you can say they can exercise on their own time. In reality though, these kids only want to loose the weight by playing a sport because they have fun doing it and remember some of them can only earn C average.

It might be a good idea because then kids would get there grade up higher so that they can play sports. so it might work while they are playing a sport, then when the sports season has ended and they don't play another sport there grades will go back down so it may work for a period of time. but it also might be able to get them to the point of a B and show them that they can do it and maintain the B average for a while.

4472129F46CF,"I think that asking for a B grade average is a little much to be able to play sports. C is called an average grade for a reason. B is above the average person.

Not everyone that plays sports has an above the average mind.

Most athletes can handle this but there are still some on the team that can't. Sometimes they have trouble maintaining a C average. Now where asking them to completely step up their whole report card? All this is doing is asking for trouble.

If we follow through with this, all they're doing is flunking more players off the sports team that they're on. This will lead to not having enough people to have a complete team. Not having enough people on a team can lead to many things. Examples are the couple that play will not get a break therefore they will be worn out and become exhaustingly tired. Then they will have trouble with the grades because they're so tired. Another is that they just won't even have the team anymore. This would make many students and parents sad and probably a little angry.

Now what we're trying to teach by doing this to the average people is to cram more. They will be so worried about a subject in school that they might forget another test that they have. This is going to distract them in their sport too. They will be so worried about making the grades so they can play that they won't be focused on the sport. Then they will start to fall behind. Then the coach will start to get mad at them for not being focused. If they start in their sport they could lose their spot because they can't focus on their sport.

obviously you can't let anyone with a D or F play but i think if a couple players got a C you should just let it slide its not like there failing.

I mean you really can't expect the whole team to be geniuses, but i think expecting them to be average would be a good call on your part.

When some kids are trying to do well in their sport they aren't going to do well in school if the average has to be a B. It should still be a C so they don't have to be even more stressed out.

Some parents might not be happy with this change either. Because their child might be just one point away from being a B average. And when their child try's to do good in school they might not be doing so well in their sport. That would mean that their coach would bench them , and that's really boring.

The reason why I am writing this letter to you is because I want to give my opinion about want you consider change the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

I think you should change this policy for the following reasons because this way they can make more effort in their studies and get better grades because most of the kids love to play sports and this way they would have that in their mind saying '' I have to make good grades so I can play''. But I also think that not everybody are going to be happy because some kids won't like it, maybe they would say '' I better go play with my friends outside the school and that way I can have fun without thinking about if I get bad grades I won't play''. But even if this happened in my opinion parents would agree with this too because at least this way their kids would have to pay more attention to the teacher and bring better grades home.

One thing that I think the school should do is to tell the parents the reasons why are they doing this and also tell them to try to support more their kids like trying to convince them why they should get good grades so they can have fun at school doing sports and don't let their children stay in the computer because at this time this is what most of the kids also love to do.

And also the parents should tell their children that if they do more sports it is good for their health.

Lastly, this wouldn't only help the kids right now because they can be getting good grades but they are not learning anything, so this would also help the kids in their future in their education maybe in the college and if the don't learn anything when they get to higher education. They won't succeed and help their families because I think in this country you can be whatever you want like a lawyer, doctor, or nurse etc. but the kids should start to get a good education from now.

I oppose that students should have a B average to play sports. Because some student don't have that grade so they cant play. However, other students have a C because maybe they are having a hard time in their classes. Also the B student don't but they don't try that much in sports and the C students do and they like to stay active and have fun.

They can also take the team the are playing in to win a trophy. Another reason is that C student maybe try hard to get at least an A but they have trouble doing that because they don't get the lesson that their teacher explained or they don't get the homework. You should at least put the C students that try hard and always do their homework and if they don't get it.

They can still try to do what they have trouble in and ask questions to his/her teacher the next day. Another reason students with a C average grade should be able to play sports is because maybe they have problems at home and they are nervous that something might happen and they don't do their homework that's why they also don't get high scores in their tests. Because they are depressed and they are not in a good mood.

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am one of your 8th grade students. I think that this policy is an amazing idea but it does have some problems. At first its good because many of our athletes that don't have good grades love the sport they play and there parents would be furious if they didn't play it. This would almost force them into becoming good students. I also think its a bad idea because what if the athlete is a very good one and he or she will decide to just quit instead of trying to put forth a good effort or he or she will not be able to pass. This would make many parents furious that there kid can't play on the team. Some parents push there kid really hard and think there child's future should rely on their athletic abilities. These parents would go to drastic measures like just pulling there kids out of school, which would make are district look bad. Another drastic thing these pushy parents might is sue the school. The schools probably would win but what if they didn't and even if the schools would win the trial they still have to pay for a lawyer. Do we really want to waste government funding on something like that or do we want to spend it on school supplies like new books and computers? I still think this would be a great idea but we should have to try and help the athletes who get more poor grades and maybe even kids who don't play sports but still get poor grades.

I do have some ideas for helping out kids. I have one idea that I like to call grade detention. It's if a kid's grades aren't at a certain percentage they would loose some privileges. They would have to attend a work friendly environment with other kids. The school would decide when and where it would meet and kids should be allowed to attend it if they just want help with grades. In the club they would take notes from a text book, work on homework, and work on extra credit assignments if they are available. The students who would have to attend this would have to attend these classes for at least half a quarter. They would each be given a piece of paper for each quarter. On this paper there will be a fill in the blank checklist and an area where they will record and keep track of there grades. A binder and hole punch will be greatly encouraged to have. They will be taught in the beginning on how to stay organized and file each paper or set of notes they take in there binder and how to record the grades the get back from the teacher. Another thing that will be encouraged in this would be learning how to have fun in school, because lets face it, school is really boring sometimes. If it's more fun kids will put forth more effort and try a little harder. One more thing they should have is a variety of colored pens. They would use this to take notes and they would be encouraged to write certain things in different colors. The multiple colors used would keep the kid awake more when they take notes and maybe some would start to like taking notes. Also the colorful notes would be more fun to read and if they use a certain color ink for important information it would be easier to study later on. These methods I have used myself and they have helped my grades improve dramatically. Please consider what I have told you and please pass this on to the super intendment and other ""higher ups"".

I have heard that you are thinking of changing the grade average policy from C average to B to participate in school activities and sports.

I absolutely love this idea but it could hurt our sport teams and our activities. It could hurt them because at least half of them have a C average which means they wouldn't be able to play and it could effect our school team. Our school events for sports are a big thing I mean a lot of people like to come and watch but if we were not that good because some of our kids were kicked off that would be sort of lame. For example, if our best player and also our biggest player did not have the grades to play he would be kicked off and we would not be that good.

I would like if it stayed as a C average to be on the sports teams because out teams would stay the same and be good. If you did bad on one test and it dropped your grade to a C that means you could not play and that's not fair. I don't think that's fair because everyone does bad on at least one quiz or test. I would be really bummed if I couldn't play a game or two because i did bad on one single test.

If they did change the policy I don't think it would be helpful because our sports would start to go down.

You have brought to mind a very good policy.

I aruge with you that students should have good grades to be in school activities .

One reason i aruge with you is that grades are very important what parent what there what there child getting bad grades i know my parents won't want that student should work there hardest for something they what in that mean getting good grades to be in the sports they want to be in .

My second reason is that having activities would want a student to work hard because having a soccer sport .Can mean good grades having something they what and not have bad grades and it also help .Keeps kids off the street not getting in to trouble .Activities are very important in a child life they have something to motive them .

My last reason why i aruge with the principal is that good grades mean good test scores and good test scores mean a performing plus school .Not just that it means we have one more child that won't be left back .",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

I wouldn't think that changing the school policy for grade average. If you change this there will have no students eligible for any school activities. Many students are at a C average. It would be impossible for most of the student body to move up a letter grade average before the sport opportunities are available for the season.

I think the grade average should stay at a B average. So, that more kids can do activities. This new policy would start making the students give up on wanting to do work. The C average is at a good range for students to be passing and be attending other fun activities.

Most students are at a C average. That's most of student body. If we had to be at a C average then there would be no sport teams for our school. Sense not all our school is at that level and some other students don't like sports. There will end up not having anyone sign up for sports. Our school will end up being the boring not fun school in our community.

I think you should not make student keep a B average but a C Average because for three reasons.

#1 Many students in school are sometimes challenged in different subjects and have a hard time with them. For example a student may have trouble with algebra and they are good in other subjects. Algebra is going to make a majority of students not play the school sport that they love to play. I play soccer and I sometimes struggle in literature. And I try my best to bringing the grade up but I still need help and I don't want soccer to be taken away from me for not maintaining a B average.

#2 Students will relax their brains by playing sports or doing other activities and having fun and the next day students will be ready and guaranteed to focus in school and feel relaxed and do the best they can do. Like I said I'm not so good in literature ,but when I'm tired and after I take a shower I grab a book and read to improve my literature skills.

#3 Lastly I want to say sports and other activities will allow students t collaborate band become more comfortable with other students and this will improve a students confidence. When I first started soccer I was always nervous to talk to people but when I start to meet people in my soccer team I wasn't nervous anymore. In school I wasn't scare to ask the teacher a question. And because of that I stared to better in school.

So principle please keep the policy to a C average and I guaranteed you students will bring up their grades and do the best they can do.

I understand that you want us students to get better grades, and maybe that's why you are doing that policy. But many students like me don't think its fair. We think its better if we have a C average instead of a B average, because many students have a C average. The students with a F or D average wont get a chance to participate in any sports because of their bad grades. C isn't a bad grade after all. It will be really unfair if the students with C average cant participate in sports like the people with poor grades. One of the reasons why the new policy should change is because C isn't a bad grade like F and D. Another reason is because sports are good for our health and everyone should have a chance to play sports. If you chose to keep the policy how it is, you should at least change it to a C average. Or if you choose to take the policy off it would make the day go brighter. The students with C, D, or F should stay after school for tutoring instead to try to bring their grades up.

Hello , my name is STUDENT_NAME. I am a student here at SCHOOL_NAME. I've heard that you were changing the school policy , and that you wanted to hear from the students. I would love for you to take the chance to read my letter . Thank You

As I stated before I've heard about the changes you want to make and I have a lot of suggestion on it . One of them is that may be after school programs is the only way some of the students stay out of trouble. So then with you taking that away from them, they will have nothing else to do . Then they will turn to the streets, and i know you wouldn't want that for our fellow students .

Also may be them getting a C grade average is the best they can do. Then our school wouldn't have the best after school activities we could have. Then the people who enjoy it the most , but doesn't meet the standard wouldn't have the ability to get a scholar ship in it even if they need it the most. Another reason is that, without after school activities students wouldn't really be able to work out. Then we would have even more students turning obesity.

I believe that the average grade to participate in a sport should be a C because it is not fair for students who depend on sports to have a good future. They shouldn't be denied that privilege because a C is still passing. Also because many students may not have the capability to maintain a higher grade, but can play a sport very well. Not all great sports legends started off by getting great grades. By not allowing them to take a sport you might be denying a child to have a future later on, as we all know many people play high school sports to get into college to become a professional. By not allowing them to play you are making it tough for them to move on in life and in education. you are making a clear statement to students all over the school that they aren't good enough to play any type of sport at all. To many children sports are always a way to take their minds off of tough decisions or private situations. Without that time to work with a team productively many children will not know how to communicate socially with other people. without the experience many children will lack the ability to communicate with others.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

Sports and other activities are essential to a student's life. It helps them develop and have fun. Sports can also have its drawbacks. I agree with you. I think the policy should be changed so that students shouldn't be allowed to play sports unless they have at least a grade B average.

To start off, sports and other activities can take time with the child's studies, causing them to have low grades. In the future the low grades will not help them to have a successful life. The grades that students make in high school can affect their futures, whether they go to college and have a well-paying job or not. Students with a C average should not be allowed to play sports and other activities because they already have a low grade, why keep on going from distracting sports. The students need to concentrate on school and to make better grades. Thirty percent of students say their grades get lower when they're involved in a sport or activity since it distracts them.

Another supporting reason is that sports tend to separate students from more important things, such as doing their homework, studying for tests, and others. This will get them lower than a C average. Students with an average B have proved they can handle these things since their grade is satisfactory. Its also unfair for those students who make an average B who play sports because they work so hard to get those grades to be able to play sports. I have had experiences with that kind of unfairness.

To sum up my thoughts, these all comes down to education. I understand that many students have a grade C average but I think changing the policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

I think that a kid shouldn't half to have at least a b average because then a lot of kids wouldn't play sports well I wouldn't.

The reason I think we shouldn't have to have a b average is because some kids that love sports my try very hard but just cant keep a b average so i mean there's no reason to have to make straight b + all the time because so of us kids just cant.

Another reason I have to support this is that you should just have to make passing grades to play if your doing that then you should be good but not making like d all the time like from a c + to a + should be good enough to play sports at school at least i think it should be like that.

The last reason I think you shouldn't have to have a b average is because so kids that like playing sports a lot just get distracted in practice and when there games are and were there at and what time they are and they just forget about having to keep a b average in school there more worried about making there school proud and wining the games.

In conclusion i hope that you read this letter and really think it through because its the truth and a c is still passing its just a little bit lower then a b so its still okay .

7F658EA3F2EA,"To the principal:

I do not agree with the proposed change to the policy affecting the minimum grade of student/athletes. Assuming that you have that power, I believe that changing the minimum GPA would not improve the grades of those people that you would have labeled ineligible to play sports for the school. If they are forced out of sports, they may turn to other activities that interest them to replace playing sports for our school, and the new activity is unlikely to be studying or doing homework. While I am a student/athlete, I am a straight-A student, so it is unlikely that I would be directly affected by this change in the rules. Many of the people who would be affected by the change would not be positively influenced by being kicked off their sports team. Some people simply can't or won't be a B average student, because of many factors weighing on them, besides the sport they play. If the rules were changed, then our athletics teams would lose many good players, which would give rival schools a clear advantage over ours in regards to the size and quality of sports teams. If i were to be kicked out of a sports team, the first thing I would do is go and sign up for a non-school-sponsored league and play in it, and I think a lot of my peers would be likely to do the same if they were put in that situation. If some people just aren't able to excel in school, but do excel in sports, changing the minimum average would be a sort of discrimination. I understand that someone's grades may be more important to you than sports, but every student is different, and some may be content to simply graduate as an average student from this school and move on to the next level in their athletics career, and you shouldn't take advantage of your power by changing their eligibility to play on an athletics team.

3B30FDC5AAE8,"Dear Mrs. Principal:

For students everywhere, the best part of school is trying out for sports. There's a different activity for all kinds of kids. Golf is for the quiet ones while football is for the loud and rowdy students. Most of these students try hard in school to get a C average, lot less a B. Some simply cannot get grades that high while others don't seem to care enough. The reason they come to school is not because they want to do algebra or literature but because they enjoy playing the sport that is afterward. You have to understand that all students on teams can't always afford to get B' s.

Not everyone is an Albert Einstein. Most students are happy with a C on a report card because a C is average. There is nothing wrong with that. B' s are harder to come by as you get older because the material you are learning becomes tougher. Some students, however, cannot absorb enough material to get a higher grade. Their mind won't hold anymore information about a subject, and the student only remembers a few things. Other children forget information. They don't do it on purpose, but it does happen. As you know, not everyone is an excellent test taker. As soon as a test is handed out, all of the information needed to take a test flies straight from the mind. Test weigh more then homework or other assignments in a grade book, so if someone were to get a 50% on a test, that would bring any grade down to a C. Now if a student has a C, they can't participate in sports if you pass this new standard. Teenagers nowadays could honestly care less about school. They come for the social time, clubs to take a role in, and sports to participate in. C is average. Anyone can make a C who isn't trying. Kids do that so they can play in sports and still hold themselves as an average student.

So, as you can see, raising the standard to a B instead of a C would not help students, but hurt them. The best player on the team could have a C average but not be able to play. This would hurt the team and then you would feel bad because you set them up for failure. It's not easy to get a B average. Very few students can. Mentality space is different for every person. No two people have exactly the same grades. Consider the ones who are horrible test takers. Their grade falls because they forget material and then they can't play sports. Do you really want to crush a kids hopes and dream? Consider this letter as you think about raising something to an impossible standard.

As an A average student I have never struggled with grades. I work hard and my effort pays off. It shows on my report card too! I only play one sport and it doesn't effect my grades much. During volleyball season (That's my sport!) I have a more organized schedule with time limits which benefits me by helping me to get my homework done, but on days with lots of homework or big games I struggle to get it done and generally miss some sleep. I think the policies should not change though because for people who struggle it is important that college should still be in their future.

Sports may be the only thing that gets them there.

From experience, I know fellow classmates with low grades often have bad backgrounds and the families behind them are not very supportive. That is not always true but it is common. That means they need a scholarship and it won't be for their grades no matter what policies and rules are in place, so they fall back on sports to provide scholarships. The policy should continue as is and will aid and promote college education for and more to young student athletes in our school.

As for extra circular activities they are only on occasion will look good on a college application and some may help to further educate students a fun, entertaining way that will hold their attentions in a place outside of school. Therefore it is also a plus to the promotion of out of school learning. Please take my opinion to heart and see the conflict at hand from our, the student body's, view point.

I do not like your changes you have made. There are many students that do not have a B or better most have a C or below. A C is an average grade for most students. If you just let people with a B or better than you will not have many people on the teams. Yes i do see why you would want to change. because if you change the people with a grade lower than a B would try to get the grade up and keep it there but is not fair for all the students because some students are smarter than others because not everyone is smart. Some people are better than others there will always be people that are better at sports than others and then there will be people that are better at school. But no mater what the will be some people that will never get there grade that high enough to play sports and i am not saying that all the smart people in the world are bad at sports. Just most of the time, the people that can not get there grade up is a good athlete.

There are people that don't have a B or better and they are good at other things besides sports. Like art club, FFA, FCCLA, and so much more. Some school don't let there students be in that stuff unless there grade is a B or better and that's not right. There is probably more than half of my grade that is better at sports or a group that cant because of there grade.

Hi I'm STUDENT_NAME here writing this letter to tell what I think about your new policy. This policy states that students are not allowed to play any type of sport without a B average. I totally disagree with this policy 100% , I think that students should be able to play any sport as long as they are passing their class by a C average but they should also be put on a warning stating that if their grade drops any lower they will be off that sport until their grades improve.

Fit activity such as sports so students can be able to stay active and fit.

By keeping all sports in our schools it will keep the students off of negative things and keep them on positive things. If we keep tutors and teachers helping the students to do better in their work I think that the students will understand how important it is to keep their grades up to play sports then we want have a problem with keeping all sports in schools. The warning will be great for students that play sports. It will show them that we are not playing with what we say about grades. As a student I can set the example for my fellow students making them want to do better in school too. So taking out sports are not really doing anything but making the situation worse and worse.

I under stand the principle wants kids to work harder, but it doesn't mean the principle has to take all there fun away. students do not like this decision because the activities are all gone unless they get a B average. Every one in the school has to work harder, but the kids are trying to tell the principle that they have worked hard enough. Students come to school to do work every day but the principle takes all there activities. Activities are the only thing they have in school that is fun. the principle may think that the work is fun but it isn't.

school is to always do work and understand what they are doing. the principle thinks they students come to school for the activities but no they don't. students come to school to work hard and to be a scholar and to go college but if taking away there activities is that important then so be it. Students try there best every day in school and have work hard enough. if the school wont let you participate then go participate in a program where they have a lot of your favorite sports. changing the school policy isn't fair for the students. students try there best every day and the principle has to take all there fun away. the students need to let the mothers and fathers know for that they can all stand up to the principle. show the principle how hard you can work and prove to him that he doesn't have the right to change the school policy and to let all your activities back.

I see now it is harder to enter sports or activities.

You see, for some students it is harder to get even a ''B'' average.

At least half of the school is getting a ''C'' average.

Are you going to not permit them to join sports because they have a ''C''?

One of my reasons why students should only have a ''C'' average is because a ''C'' is a passing grade.

I understand that a ''C'' is not really a grade to settle with.

To me a ''C'' grade means that i am falling down and i need to get back up.

So to me it pretty much means a warning.

That should go for other students, too.

You shouldn't just settle with a ''C''.

For example, what if a student is a really great athlete or really loves participating.

Are you really going to take him/her out of all the fun activities just because they have a ''C'' which is passing.

That is like saying,'' I am going to kick you out of activities and sports even though you have a passing grade.'' Not fair, right?

My last reason that i am going to share with you is what if that student is having problems at home or with a close friend or maybe even depression because of a death that occurred.

That is the probably reason why some students can't focus right in school and they are getting a ''C'' instead of them normally getting an ''A'' or ''B''.

By not letting students without a B average not play sports will cause many problems. Some kids just are not that smart, but are very good at a sport. It will decrease the amount of kids playing in sports as well. I could understand if they were about failing, not letting them play, but a B average is outrageous.

Some kids are very athletic in our community. They are not very smart but they meet the requirements to play. If you changed this , there would not be as many kids playing in sports.

We may not even have a sports team because we don't have kids playing. this may not just be in sports either.

It may also affect kids in band and other extra curricular activities. Kids will be devastated at this fact. The thing they love is gone because of their grade. Although it will help the kids strive to do better in school, but it may cause them to not care anymore and give up.

I don't think it's fair to make students have a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities. Many students that have a C average might need sports or other activities to feel good about themselves. Some students use sports to get healthier and make new friends. If they have C average grades they might be trying really hard, but some are too shy to ask questions, and sports can help them make new friends so they can talk more. That might raise there grades but if they can't play sports in the first place there grades might go down instead of up.

Some kids are only good at a couple things. One of those things might be Band, Art, Cooking, Sewing, or Chess, or

Basketball, or even reading. If you take those things away from them because of there grades they will feel like there not good at anything. For example if a C average kid wants to join band because music is his favorite thing in the world, and he wants to be a musician when he grows up, he won't have the right amount of experience to achieve his goals because he had average grades.

Another reason you shouldn't make kids have a B average is because nobody is perfect all the time. They might have a good A average year and then drop to a C average another year. Then because they couldn't enjoy there favorite activities last time, their grades will go down more because they don't have enough experience to make the team, which will make them feel bad about themselves and not want to try to get there grades up anymore. They don't get there grades up because they don't care about making the team so they don't care anymore. Their only good part of school every day is sports or other activities that they do.

Principle TEACHER_NAME,

As a student that participates in sports, I know how myself and the other athletes feel about the new academic standards. Many students have been working on raising their grades, and this can be achieved only if time is allowed. I understand that this school strives for academic excellence, but students also need exercise and after-school activities in order to succeed in and out of school.

Students have learned how to make time for studying and sports, and have kept to the previous standard of an overall C average. I believe many of these students' grades would drop if they did not have to keep to those standards. They might also drop if the students weren't also challenged in other ways. My fellow students agree that we can all keep a B average, but should not be penalized right away due to the short notice of this change.

Raising a grade does not happen over night. These students will still be studying as much as possible, and doing their absolute best on all assignments as usual. Of course, tests can be weeks apart. The school should have a testing period before they decide the new policy is the official one. During this period, no student should be penalized.

Sports keep students focused. If you suspend the student from an extra-curricular that he/she loves, the student won't be trying to learn, they will be trying to memorize enough to barely pass. By accepting that students can achieve the acceptable average while still playing with their team, both parties will be happy in the end. Especially while this new standard is still being thought out.

The athletes believe they should be allowed to keep the C average standard for the rest of the 2010-2011 school year. If the school board still in the end decides to make their new standards the official policy, the students will be coming in with a new attitude on the first day.

The school's standards have been effective for some time, each student graduating and moving on to exceptional high schools; some even with sports scholarships! Why would the school want to change a good thing? Our school has pride due to academic, religious, social, and sporting excellence. By allowing students to work at their own pace, the school will be able to keep their high standards and reputation.

Please consider this proposal because it comes from the core of the school - from the students themselves. They know that it is possible to keep to academic standards while participating in something they love. By working together and hearing all sides of the argument, I am certain that a final decision can be arranged; one in which all parties are happy.

Lets got back to the subject so yea i don't like the way ur doing things put the school policy at if they go under a d there off the team all my friends have good grades they all play football and basketball and u think they would like it if they got kicked off the team because there grade went under a b i don't think anyone would like that besides sports are the only fun thing to do at school so yea that's all i really got to say.

I like playing football because it runs in my family my dad played it my dads dad played it my moms dad played it my moms brother played it my brother played it i play it so please don't make it where if u have a grade lower than a b u take kids off the football team i would appreciate it if u did thank u have a great day oh yea and if u haven't seen it in the letter make it where if u go lower than a d u get kicked off the football team now have a great day

I think you should not make the average grade from a C to a B to participate in sports.

I think you should not do that because many students maybe trying their hardest ever but is still struggling to get a higher grade in school. Also if you make the average to a B it may make some of the students work harder, but you would maybe lose almost all your players on that sports team, since most of them have C' s in their grades. And also some of the students would not get a scholarship on that sport they are playing because you raised the average to a B. Also some of the best players on teams sometimes has the lowest grades out of all the players on that sport they are playing. In my opinion I think it would make a lot more students happier if raised it to a low B. Or even maybe a high C. Maybe u should maybe leave it alone.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2
79CF90622262,"Dear Principle,

I think that making students have at least a B in a class is a bad policy. It will make students less likely to try out for sports and some students need sports to be able to stay in shape. Also some students will do better in school if they have a sport to play to clear their mind after a long day at school. For others it is something fun to do to get their mind off of the C and to put it behind them. Sports can also be a social thing and a C should not be able to take that away unless it is a parents decision.

It can also be a good thing. It could get students to work harder at a grade to get to play a sport. It could get some students to help others out if they need them on the team so it would help both sides. It could even get coaches to get talking to kids about keeping good grades so they can keep playing sports.

With everything I know i could say all in all it would probably turn out to be a bad policy in the end. Many students just won't care enough and eventually there will be no sport teams at all. Some parents may get involved and argue about it and possibly take their kid out of the school system. Below a C would probably work out better and would make everybody a lot happier. There will probably not be parental involvement and even students will like to be able to get one bad grade and still be able to play sports. If you compromise everybody will be happier and school and grades will be much more enjoyable.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

After the students finds out the have to have a certain grade for that particular sport they try and do better. For many of the students they love and enjoy sports and other activities and when it comes to grades the feel like a grade of C is the best that they can do. If u change the policy they will start to fall behind in school and that C will start going to a D then maybe even a F. many of the students grades start to go up when the do sports and many other activities since many of the sports wont let you play unless you have a average of C possibly a B and if it turns out that is what it is going to happen then they would try harder and their grades go up. If a person participates in different things like after school sports or something that keeps many students out of trouble. When students participate in sports the get more active a bit more. and they go on healthy and stronger. stronger now because sports help a person learn their strengths and weaknesses. If you still decide to change the school policy still i just want to say that's going to be a big mistake. it will be a mistake now because students will stop trying and won't get higher grades or be healthy.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
AEC47500AA79,"Its not right for them to make us only have a grade B average for us to do any sports. a lot of kids work really hard on getting those grade C average and if you move it up to a B average people may just quite doing the sport they where in and not care about there grades and start getting an D average. People need stuff to motivate them in to doing what they love but if you start setting the standards too high they will feal pressured and just quit. we get enough pressure from are parents, friends, loved ones and from everyday life we don't need extra weight on are shoulders.

and what if you work really hard in all of your grades but you just slip in one subject and your grade turns out to be a C but all the rest of your grades are an B or above and just because of that one little grade you cant participate in that sport just because you got an C.

I can understand if you get a 60 in one subject and you cant participate in that sport because of that, it makes since because your failing and if you keep failing then you may have to repeat that grade and that's not good plus it looks bad on an collage application. But, a 70 is still passing and they shouldn't kick you out just for that.

I know that the schools are just probably trying to boast there grade averages but it may be less pressure on you but more on the students so don't take away the one thing that brings joy to the people, you can find another way to boast grades by not taking away anything.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
68B1B9C3EA1D,"A lot of ideas come right to me when I think about having C average and I think children should not be able to play because this will teach them responsibility, and they might pull up there grades if they really wanted to play, and they will pull up the grade and have the school be represented with high quality students.

Responsibility is something so many kids in schools do not understand yet. They need to know that in a couple of years they will have college and things will get really difficult. We need our children to understand that their grades will ruin them if they do not try to do their best at school. Education is so important, one mistake can destroy a person. Children might think that having a B average is hard but if they really want to play a sport I know that every person can do It .

Students every year get held back because of low grades and the conduct. Having only A and B average students play sports and other activities. This will teach students with lower average than at least a B that they need to show that they can do a whole lot better and raise there grades up to the standard to play. A lot of kids think they can get away with playing sports while there grades are below what we want them to be and if we prevent them from having to much power they will see that they can not be able to do something they cherish and love.

Possibly parents and students do not care about what their child has on report cards, but I am guarantied that our school and school systems care. We do not want a school to look bad and show bad examples for others. Principals like to have compliments that they get from others about how great they run the school and the high quality averages. Schools get to feel special if the kids work hard. They might get to go somewhere or be represented and show what they got and know.

Students, parents, grandparents, teachers and especially principals, need to show kids what they are capable of doing and how important it is for them, their schools and for others that will look at you and your steps and examples. This is why I think principals should have a no lower than a B average for sports and activities. Students will have responsibility, raise their grades up, and have their schools appreciated by the high education and grades they get.      ",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

Kids at SCHOOL_NAME should be able to participate in sports, even if they have a grade C average. Grades shouldn't have to interfere with sports, their are two different subjects. they are both very important to kids. There are three reason why kids should still participate in sports even with a C average.

The first reason is, some kids that want to grow up and be a pro soccer player or a pro football player don't need school for it. Kids want to dedicate their time to sports to get better at it, and not on homework or studying. For some kids spots is all they think about because its their dream to become a pro soccer player or pro football player.

The second reason is, sports sometimes aren't the only reason why kids have a C average. So why would sports need to be taken away for the grades if playing sports isn't the problem. Kids might have a C average because they don't try in school or they need help on what their learning. Principles and parents should encourage kids to do their work, study for tests, and help them.

I have all of my averages in the 90s and above.

The new policy doesn't affect me but I must say that I strongly disagree.

Many students cannot keep up with their grades, and look towards sports as an answer.

Some people have a natural talent for sports, but their grades aren't as high as a B.

I have played soccer my entire life and other kids my age have been the same with other sports.

In my household, my parents do not tolerate anything lower than a 90% .

I do not know about anyone else, but some people, allow their grades to be in the 80 range.

I find it unfair for a new policy to be at hand because there are kids in this world that are mentally challenged.

What if they were not able to keep up in their class work but they loved to play baseball.

Would that be fair to them?

Would it be fair to not let them play the sport that they love just because they are in the C range?

I understand if they were failing all of their classes, but I feel that raising the standards to a B is kind of harsh.

I am a soccer player who plays for the NJ Stallions.

My team went to the 2010 North American Super-Y Nationals, in Tampa, Florida.

It took a lot of effort and time to get there.

We practice every single day of the week.

Most of the kids on my soccer team have a B average, while the others had a C average.

If that was the school soccer team, the players with the C average, wouldn't be able to go.

What if they were the top goal scorers on the team?

I believe that you should not go with changing it from a ""B"" average to a ""C"" average. For example, most students have a ""C"" average and this would not be fair for them. Unless you provide these student with free tutoring then make it a ""B"" average. For example, if a student has a ""C"" average they will not be able to participate in these activities and the leaders of this country are already complaining about obesity.

For starters, these most students have a ""C"" average and it will not be fair. You might not know if these students have issues or struggle keeping this ""C"" average. They might have issues at home that distract them from getting better grades. In some cases the students might have learning disabilities that keep them from improving in school.

Yes i know it would be asking too much to provide these students with private tutors, but that is what might give them the little extra help that they need. and lets say that the school doesn't have enough funding to give these students the help they need. Then you cannot make the average grade for them to participate in these activities higher.

Lets say that these student cannot play in these after school activities and they just give up on sports because they know that they have to maintain such a high grade average and they get overweight. this will happen from the lack of exercise that the children have. I am pretty sure this is not what the country wants for its future.

I hope that you understand what I am trying to say. It would be harder for these students to do what they love. It can also do bad things for their health. It would make students more lazy, and other things that can harm them or make them feel bad or angry.      ",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
4F112B2712E2,"Dear TEACHER_NAME (Principal) ,

I think that your consideration on changing school policy so that only grade B average (or better)

students would be allowed to participate in sports or other activities is a smart idea. Students love participating in sports and other activities therefore, students will strive to try to make their grades better. Another reason I think it is a smart idea is because if they do this they wont only be allowed to play sports and activities but would have overall better grades. It would build confidence in themselves that if they want something and if they push themselves hard enough, they will get it. Although these are great reasons some people may think, this new policy might be unfair because everyone should be allowed to participate, but in the end if they work hard enough, they will be able to participate.

This policy will let students reach for something they want, but they also have to work hard for it. In my opinion if i had this option and if i was a grade C average and i wanted to participate in these activities, i would try my best to work hard and do better in school so that i would be able to participate in the activities.

Other student's opinion's count and I'm pretty sure not everyone thinks this policy would be fair, they might argue that your grades shouldn't affect what activities you are allowed to be involved in. I don't agree with this statement because the students who work hard for their grades should deserve a reward and for those who don't, it wont be a consequence but more of a way to motivate those students into doing something better for themselves.

In the end, I think this policy is a great idea because it would give grade B & A students a reward and grade C students motivation to do better.

Lately there has been an ongoing debate over sports and grades. You might already know this but I will say it anyways: Most students don't like the idea of having to have a 'B' average in order to be able to participate in sports. And I personally don't blame them. There exist a couple of opinions and I hope that you are ready to hear mine. Personally i don't think that this rule should exists though I understand why it does. Though you might think that I am just saying it because I am like every other student, its nothing of that sort. Here's why:

You might not realize it but kids have a lot to worry about on a daily basis. Especially with things going on at home. Not letting them do sports or extracurricular activities is like taking sleep away from a cat. They need it in order to be able to relax a little and be able to think more clearly. That little time they have off might be what is holding them together. that little competitive effort is what can make them succeed in life.

Which brings me to my next topic. Nowadays what colleges really look for is that you are heavily involved in after school activities.

If you don't they think that you might not get along well with other kids. No matter how good your grades may be. All they worry about is that you are smart and social. If you worry about grades all the time, you loose your social part of you. And you might not be accepted into college because of that.

Most importantly though is that i believe that grades don't depend on what you do outside of school only. They can also depend on the teacher, friends, family, and many other things. You never know if it was because someone died in their family. Or if it is that they are just having a hard time with something. You cannot just assume that it is the sport that's doing this to them. you also have to consider all of the other options in their lives.

I know for a fact that you have a lot on your mind these days. From putting discipline to students, to dealing with teachers and school meetings, so I will only take up a little bit of you time. and that this is just another burden to add to all of that. you might not even be the one who makes the rules. All I am asking though, is that you consider the things that I have told you. At least you could ask to bring it down to the average being a 'C' average since that's what most of us have. it might even motivate us to do better.

You might not think its worth it now but you will agree with it later on. After all aren't kids our future?",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I believe that you made the correct decision. Education is very important in a students life. Being the principal, you should enforce this rule and by doing so, would improve a students future for the better. You should ask yourself one question and ask many other students the same question; What will get you through your life and guarantee a good future, education or sports? This question will stump all the arguments they have except for one. An athletic scholarship.

I agree that sports is good for the health, but is it absolutely necessary for the future? I say no, because not everyone is going to get an athletic scholarship. The odds are for getting an athletic scholarship are slim and there will be many people who are competing for it too. Education is very important and there are many jobs out there that require people with an education, while as there are very few jobs that require you to be good at sports. In this world, education will get you far and having a C average isn't going to cut it.

If they spend just as much time studying as they do playing sports, then it wouldn't be a problem, but when they neglect studying just to play sports, then they are harming there future. Think about all the futures you could save by just putting a little discipline. A C isn't very far from an F and that could jeopardize there whole life. If they study hard, they can have fun and live a good life when they get older, but having fun and neglecting studying now isn't going to give them a relaxing and fun future.

If they are trained to study hard and play sports at the same time, it will pay off because they will have to get organized and pay attention to time management. This is very important in High school and College because time management and organization will get you good grades. I strongly recommend that you enforce this rule. Just watch the events unfold when you enforce it. There grades will rise and eventually they will be accustomed to all the hard work they put in. Education is everything and will shape your life, while sports is just an extracurricular activity that might or might not get you an Athletic scholarship.",5,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.8

I think the best way too do this is too let them have a C but when there season starts then have one practice be a day when they study on there work there missing. I mean yea a C is not the best thing for you too have so you can get in a College but its better then a D. And maybe if the student is smart he will realize if he really likes that sport then he would get that grade up to a B or better because the best student would want too over achieve in there life to get where they want too be.

And the students have too remember that they are a student athlete and when you are that, that means you have too do your work be for you want to play that sport. So I really think we should see if the students would rather be a C student and while they play one of there practices can be where they do there work instead of practice so they can get there grades up.

So that's how I feel bout having a B just too play a sport. A C should be good enough for that student to play that sport. So do you agree with me?",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

I think the new policy is unfair to us. Some students like sports and now can't play them because of this new rule. Students on the school's sports teams might not get to play now because their grade average is lower than a B.

One reason that I stated in the paragraph above is that some students like sports. Students that play sports stay active and fit. They remain healthy and happy. The new rule takes that away from the students.

The other reason I wrote was that school sports teams may lose good players because they have C average grades. We wouldn't get any new students or a good reputation. Those students that were kicked out of sports could have made the school better.

On the other hand, I see why you made this new rule. One reason is because it's not fair to the A average students to have worked so hard for their grades, those students deserve to play sports with students of the same grade level. Another way that the rule seemed necessary is because students that don't try to do good shouldn't have the privilege to play in sports or other after-school activities.

In conclusion, these students work hard at sports and don't want all that practicing to go to waste. This new rule isn't right because it's not fair to the students. Students that like sports or are in school sports will get angry because they won't get to do what they love.

You have made the decision to take out all sports and other activities completely from the school due to the C average, as opposed the B average needed to participate in the activities, that most of the students have. I am writing this letter to you to give you my, and the students, opinion on this decision.

Taking out sports and other activities from the school due to grade averages being lower than they should be to even participate in the activities, is a reasonable cause. If you don't mind, I would like you to take this into consideration.

Students play sports because it gives them a way to express themselves while doing something they love. If a student is doing poorly in a subject they do not particularly care for, the sport they participate in after school makes them feel better about what they do. It also gives them incentive to do better in the subject they aren't doing so well in.

Another subject to take into consideration is the students health. Physical education class gives some physical activity in school, but when the subject is volleyball and the student prefers basketball, they tend to not do well and to not give it their all. Keeping the sports gives the students a chance to be on an actual basketball team rather than having them on a team where students aren't taking things seriously. The students that make the basketball team are participating in physical activity that they enjoy doing.

Taking out other activities such as an academic quiz team would hurt some of the students who were doing it. The students on the quiz team study hard to do well during their matches. Taking that away from them would hurt them and possibly even discourage them from studying for their schoolwork. Students on the quiz team take pride into what they do. In a way they set an example for the other students to do well in school.

An alternative to taking away the sports all together would be to set up a tutoring group made up of students helping other students having similar interests in school and outside of school. This could bring up averages quite a bit. Students may not like the idea at first, but if quiz games were added within each subject the students may like that more. You could also have certain days for certain subjects to focus in on problem areas within the subject.

Thank you for considering the following concerning the matter of sports and other activities within our school. The students would be very pleased to hear that you listened to them in these trying times.

Sir, this is an a very bad idea that you have concocted, and I cannot sit idle and watch you make this bad decision. The idea of changing school policy isn't a bad idea in itself. But the idea of not letting my peers take extra-curricular classes is a drastic change in the policy that we have become accustomed to.

Some students take these activities as motivation to do better in school, or to keep them out of trouble. It should be duly noted that RELATIVE_NAME has changed dramatically since his inclusion in after school tennis. He's gone cold turkey on smoking, and has converted himself into the Christian faith! That is only one example.

Every student has a story, a background. Sometimes, there is a glue to holding their life together, whether it be band, glee club, or football. Every student deserves a chance to have fun and do what interests them, and if it didn't interest them, they wouldn't show up to these activities.

Sir, I implore you to think twice on this possible change. Without these activities, the students might come to a point to where they don't respect you as much as they could. Instead, you could see what the students are struggling with, and get teachers to help them in there areas that are needing assistance. Maybe even instead of changing the policy, just add another after-school activity set on helping people in need. To help raise the C average to a B.

I respect that you are considering to do this all for our well-being, and that is obvious enough. But I think the answer to all of this isn't necessarily a dramatic change. I urge you to make a different decision. The students will respond more positively to a different approach.

I think that it is wrong for the school to make anyone with a grade C average not participate in sports or other activities. Most people want to try out for sports this year and hopefully for years to come. This will minimize the amount of players who try out but then they might not be the best players. Some of the really good players may have a C average but if they are really good and they cant be on the team then the new team might not represent the school as well.

One thing that you could do to maybe improve the grades is making sure that they are always up to date on their work and making sure that they are getting decent grades. My old volleyball coach had us do a grade checks and S-U forms every week to keep up with our grades. We would have to have a teacher, parent, and the coach sign it every week. The S was for is for satisfactory or good behavior in class and the U was for unsatisfactory, or needs work on the behavior in class. The teacher would circle the S or the U twice a day, once in the beginning of class and then once at the end of the class. Then the teacher would leave a comment and what homework that was assigned that day. The grade checks allowed the teacher to keep in touch with the student's grade as well as the coach, and parent.

Some of the examples above are what you can possibly use to improve the students grade as well as keep up with them. So with my statements above i think you should move the grade average back down to a C rather than a B average to participate in school sports and activities.

I disagree with the decision you took for changing the grade average to participate in sports or other activities. There many reasons on why I disagree with your decision. First, our athletic students in our school are not smart and usually get C' s on their report card. If you change the grade average, those students won't be able to participate in school sports. If the school's athletic students can't play then the sports department will suck and be awful. A awful sports department will look bad for our school and cause other schools to insult our sports department. Would you like that? Another reason is that a C average is a decent grade. It is way better than a D or a F. Our school district says that a C and above is passing. So why can't the grade average to participate in sports be C? Thirdly, many students in our school have C average and if you change it to a B average, then not many students could tryout for sports and less students trying out won't give the coaches to many students to choose from. In some sports, less students will tryout and then that sport won't have a full team. Lastly, changing the grade average to a B will cause hatred from the students towards you. Will you like having students upset and angry at you? I hope you understand my point of view and take the correct decision.

I think that to participate in sports or other activities you should have to remain at a grade C average. C is the average grade for a student. Some people have trouble maintaining a grade C average and still like to participate in sports or other activities.

A grade B is above average for students. Many student may have trouble keeping up with there work for grade

B average just continue to sink there grades down. A higher average then a grade C is just not necessary for these students.

A study club would benefit both ways, either a grade C average or a grade B average. A study club is a chance after school for students to get help on there work. If one students grades are bad because he is having trouble understanding his work, a study club would help with that because then teachers could help him after school to get his work done and handed in on time.

My last reason is that students do not need to be pushed that hard to be able to do what they love to do. Most school you have to have a C average to play in sports. Considering that is hard for some students to make, so a B would make it almost impossible for certain students. Most of the students also play sports or participate in other related activities.

In conclusion, I would say that maintaining a grade C average is already enough for students. Most of the students now have a grade C average and a couple have a grade B average.

If a student will not try to improve his/her grade you can change it to a b o above. The first thing you can do is have all the teachers tell you the student that play sports grades. After you see a week of the students grades then you can decide if they should have to quit the team until there grade goes up to at least a b.

Here are a few other ways to keep students grades up first talk to each student the does sports about their grades, second talk to the parents about what to do with the students bad grades, and last tell the coach about each students grades.

If any students do not bring their grades up on tests and homework then make them promise to get good grades on the test and homework if they want to play sports again. I realized that if you take something important away they would act better. Every two weeks you should check their grades if some came up and others didn't. I would recommend talking with the teachers and students and ask why haven't your grades come up. If they say they where out last week and just got back check with the teachers to make sure they are telling the truth.

Some students may need help, because they are confused about the work the teacher gave them and not asking for help this could be a reason some students never bring their grade up from a c .

I do not believe it is right that you should change the grade average to participate in sports. There are many reasons and even benefits to keeping the grade average the same. Such as ability, responsibility, and many other reasons that will be discussed in this letter.

The first and for most reason would be because of academic ability. I do not think that athletes should be punished for not being able to achieve what is considered by some academic greatness. To maintain a b average is hard when you have practise, chores, and many other things to do. Not to mention the fact you have been at school all day.

My next option is that kids should be able to do what they want after school is over. If we have to spend eight hours a day five days a week here on top of homework ,chores ,and whatever else comes up we should not be made to have a b average to do something we love and want to do.

My next point is we should have to have the responsibility to hold ourselves accountable for our grades we shouldn't be held to that by other people and their threats. We should be the ones to care for our grade ,and if it gets too low we should take responsibility and take ourselves out of sports.

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter.

Sincerely,

STUDENT_NAME      ",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6
