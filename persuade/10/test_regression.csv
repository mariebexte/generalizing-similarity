9394F1006E9B,"TEACHER_NAME I think you should let the grade average for sports to be at least a c. the reasons are people that play sports have a lot of work to do they have to do school work practice for sports and they mite have to do chores at their house. They have lots of fun in sport a lot of people mite get kicked out of sports and not have fun at school as much. Kids will have time more after school to hangout with friends. My last reason is if less people play sports less people representing the school.

If kids at the school already have a lot of work to do then when you add on the higher grade's its just making them struggle even more. who knows they mite have problems at home. play sports to get away from them. they already have school grades to keep up to a c even when they don't worry about that they have to worry a lot on sports if they want to make the cut.

I think if people get kicked out of sports they will probably be sad and wont care about there grades anyways. i know i probably would be. If they are already depressed about something else you should add gas to the fire. so if you would just leave it a c it would help them a lot.

If we have less people in our sports then we have less people representing our school and making us know. i hope this helped you change your mind. I really like hearing and watching all the sports so please reconsider your decision.

If we have less kids in sport cause of grades less happy kids and more depressed kids. so hope this essay helped you change your mind. sincerely,

BCA5C180FFD4,"If the principal would change the school policy some kids would tell their parents to let them go to a different school that allows atleast a c average to play sports or activities.

Then maybe the school principal well maybe not suggest the policy that she was thinking about doing and plan a different policy instead of changing the grade average to play a sport.

Then however if she did change the school policy maybe some kids might like having to try hard in their classes. But, the kids that don't want to try hard in their classes might not like that they have to get a b average in all classes to play a sport. Then so which is why they probably like the old policy better than the new one she is planning.

Then but maybe the kids could talk to the principal about making some rules up about trying to make the sport they want to join. Which would come as they needed to get atleast a c+ on each class to join for a sport and or pass every test they got or another one would be just try to get a b in each of your classes.

Next if would come down to what your principal thinks of the ideas you had given her to think about for the school policy she made up. Then you would need to honor those rules that you had suggested for her to make if she decided to make that policy.

Next i know some friends who have some b's and c's on their grade average. Then what would the principal do then she had to choose if it was good to play or not good enough that maybe you needed to get one more b.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
2DFE8246A388,"The policy of students not being able to participate in sports or other activities unless they have B average is a praiseworthy one because it encourages students to soar academically. First of all, those who desire to participate in extracurricular activities, which is a large portion of students, will be forced to try their hardest in school.

Putting one-hundred percent of their efforts into academic-related activities, such as studying for exams, doing their homework, etcetera, will help students in the long run.

They will get better grades, go to better colleges, get better jobs, and ultimately live better lives. This policy encourages this needed hard work in school, thus, is a commendable one. Second of all, students will better grasp the concept of responsibility. Responsibility is an essential factor of life, and needs to be encouraged as much as possible.

To have the responsibility of trying hard in school and getting better grades, is to value the future of oneself, others, and the world.

If schools support this idea of having the responsibility of getting good grades, then students will improve academically and intellectually.

In conclusion, the policy in question is plausible because would contribute to the betterment of the world and its people's lives.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
83CAAFEF8194,"Dear Reader,

I would first off like to say that I agree with your new policy, that students must have a grade B average in order to participate in any sports, or other activities, for school. If students can't keep their grades up, then I think that they could possibly need more time to study, or do homework, rather then playing sports.

Your grade averages ''follow you'' onto high school, and so depending on how well your grades are, determines whether or not you could perhaps get scholarships to college(s). Which financially takes a toll off of you, because you wouldn't have to pay for tuition.

I understand your point of view. Your just trying to help students keep well grades, so they're better off in the future. Some students may not exactly understand that, yet, but I'm sure they'll realize your trying to do what's best. By focussing on the priority of encouraging them to make good grades, and then they can have the option to take extra activities.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

My name is STUDENT_NAME and i do not agree with you about having at least a B average to play a sport.

I believe that students should at least have a C average because the sports they have keep them healthy and fit.

If you made it the way you want it, the students could end up obese or their grades might drop.

If they are to have at least a C average, they are still getting good grades and doing their homework.

Students rely on their sports to stay healthy and even though their grade are not a B average, but they are still trying and getting the work done.

I am going to be in three different types of sports in one year, cheering, color guard and volley ball. So as you see i also rely on sports but not only because they keep me fit and healthy but because i enjoy doing them.

Students all around the world are in different sports and even thought they might not have the best grades, you know that they are having fun and they enjoy doing what they do; But if you take their sports away, what are they suppose to do on their free time?

There might even be a lot more fighting and arguments because of all the free time on their hands.

If they already do their studying in a regular basis, are they suppose to just sit on the couch, eat food and watch television? Here that's what we call being lazy.

Students should have fun and its good for them to socialize.

If they are in sports, that could be a possible scholarship, even if they have a C average. You can see there progress in their school work if you let do their sports. A healthy body equals a healthy mind.

You shouldn't pressure students into doing their work and getting good grade because those students' grades can begin to decline and they might even transfer school to do what they love, I would.

Students need that endurance and a lot of strength to go through the rest of their life. So please listen to me, keep it at a C average and let students work up to a B average.

They would really appreciate that.

Like I said, students need and love their sports.

I would like to put in a nice way that my opinions are different from yours. My opinions are different because, I, myself have two C's. It is not my fault that those subjects are not my strongest. Why should I or any other students be punished for it? Getting a C is average, nothing bad. Students with a C average should be getting help from a tutor maybe but shouldn't be cut from sports.

Having sports is a healthy activity. It keeps us in shape and keeps us out of doing bad things like stealing or doing drugs. It also gets our energy out. Without sports I would be bored a lot. We also see our friends during sorts and we make new sports. Having sports prepare us for the real world by helping us meet and cooperate with new people.

Instead of taking away our activities talk to us. Maybe it's not sports that is causing our grade. It could be the teachers or our peers. I understand why grades are important so you should have an after school club for homework and school help. That way we can be with friends and help our grades. I hope you consider my points and don't take away sports. It would be such a shame.

The idea have having students have a B average grade is a wonderful idea!

Students may complain about this but i think it is the best for all of us.

When I played volleyball my couch all ways said that we had to have our grades up.

That is why we are ""student athlete's"".

Hence the word ""student"".

It would be very bad if a student was failing because they were working on their jump shots or touch downs instead of their homework.

I know it is hard for a team when there best player cant play because of grades but grades should come first in a persons life!

Sports aren't always going to be there.

Being a famous sport player is not very realistic.

You have to work on your school work because you are more likely going to have a REAL job some day. I heard a story that a friend of mine had a F in math and they wouldn't let her play. Yes, i felt bad for her but at the same time I didn't.

I didn't because if she had just worked harder she wouldn't have to have gone through that. My dad always says ""work before play!""

I know students will not be very happy but it is a fact that you have to work on grades more than your athletic career!

That is when u have to keep in mind that you are the rite one.

They are wrong!

You know what is best for them, if they like it or not. So don't listen to there wining!

Give them time to get there grades up then let them in to play.

Go with your gut on what is the good for them.

Having the students have a B average grade is a fantastic idea.

So stick with it!

Students need to work on their path way to collage.

It is a ""win, win"" situation! They get to play sports and You get your students to get good grades!

So keep in mind ""work before play""!!

B3842469B183,"Dear principal,

I do not agree with having only B average students participating in sports and other activities. Since most students have a C average, it isn't fair to be having only B average students to participate in sports and activities. There are many different opinions that I have on this policy.

It is important to allow students to participate in other activities, not just for fun, but for health reasons too. As a growing kid, they would need to have exercise. I think it should be the parents decision to have their child play sports or not. I also think if students chose to participate in activities it could possibly help their education, the more they know the better it would be in any type of education.

Another reason I disagree is it would not make sense because there would most likely not be enough students to even participate and have full teams. That is not a good idea, because if no one can participate, that is not fair to the B average students. If most students have a C average instead of a B, you might need to work something out. A suggestion would be letting the kids with a C average participate, and below C average students could not.

A grade B is higher than average, so if you are expecting your students to get higher than a C that is expecting them to work on their abilities that they might not be able to fix. If students get a C average, they could be struggling, it does not necessarily mean they deserve to not be able to participate in sports and activities like other kids do. I believe that if this was made a new policy, it would be wrong and you should consider re-thinking another suggestion to change this.

I hope you will consider a new suggestion. Thank you for reading my opinion on the new policy you are considering.

62049767E58C,"Did you ever have a favorite sport as a child? Did you have a bunch of baseballs or soccer balls in your room? Did you ever run up to your parents asking for nothing but to play a game or basketball with you? Imagine you failed a math a test because you didn't understand the concept and your grade suddenly went down from a perfect A right down to a C. Try outs for the soccer team are next week and you really want to go. You've been waiting for it for the whole year, but then you realize you can't because of your grades.

Changing the grade requirement for sports from a B to a C is a big consideration. People with D' s or F' s obviously haven't earned the privileged to be eligible for sports, but what about people will C' s? The average letter grade for students are C' s. I think changing the average for grades to B is going to be a hard change for students.

A compromise that maybe can be done is looking at the students other grades. If a student has just one C and all A' s or B' s the rest, he is eligible for the team. If a student has all C' s, then he is probably not a very good candidate for someone who tries hard to keep up their grades.

I argue that students with C' s should be accepted on to the sports team because not everyone can get perfect grades all the time. Everyone has their moments when they didn't get the topic or were having a bad day on a test day.

What should be considered when trying out for a sports team is the effort of a student, their ability to try, and their skills. Of course it's important that students are doing well in school and that they can juggle both sports and schoolwork. For some people it's hard to maintain both at the same time and you can't always tell that from someone's grades. Students that have A' s could slip down to a D' s just by not doing their homework because they had a game that day. In that case, the students is not able to handle both school and sports.

I imagine that if the grade average was pushed up to a B to be on a sports team, students would try as hard as they could to get their grade up, but who says they haven't been trying already? What if a D student tried so hard to be on the school team, but could only raise it up to a C?

These are all some of my reasons on why I think that the school policy shouldn't be changed. Grades are can be very hard to maintain for students sometimes and a C is a good letter grade to decide if you can be on the sports team or not.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.6

I have heard that your new rule was that students have to have a B average to play sports I disagree with this rule because first sports can keep kids healthy and not over weight secondly I believe that sports is a way to get students mind off of school.

The reason I think sports is should be a priority is because they keep you healthy and if kids are over weight they will probably be made fun of.

Secondly school may be overwhelming for some students and when they get home they just do more overwhelming homework so if they have sports to go to that would get there mind of school and get it refocused then they will be more prepared.

In consideration of the school grades policy, I believe we students should have at least a C average to be able to participate in school activities.

Most students who have C' s have them because they are trying hard to get to B' s and A' s, but are not quite there yet.

Taking away promotional activities such as Basketball or Soccer would be unfair, considering how hard they work for they're grades to elevate to the C level.

Sure, some students may stop trying if a C grade is acceptable. However most do keep trying at raising grades for other reasons, one could be the approval of parents or other situated guardians. My firm belief is that we should grant C students; the rights to Sports and other fun extra circulator events, to award for at least a good trying effort at getting bad grades higher.

I have heard that you are going to make it to where you have to have a B average to participate in sports or other after school activities I am very displeased with this and I will give you reasons. My first reason is first of all most of the school's population are only at a C

average so most people may not do sports. Another is that the passing grade level in this district is a C so if you pass you can do sports and other after school activities. Also i' m not sure it is in your power to do this i believe the school board of this county can do that not individual schools.

Now this might cause students to work harder but most students will want to focus on their sport rather than grades so they will probably get only a C average. This means the entire team of all the sports will be kicked out so there will be no point if there is no one to play the sports. Now to recap most students only have a C average and will not be able to play sports if this policy goes through. Remember I am against this new B average policy.

The change in the sports policy is very naive, and it will not bring up student's grades, but bring down the performance of the sports teams. Some students who are talented at sports have a hard time with schoolwork, and getting a C is the best that they can do. A C is average, and if a student is average then it doesn't make sense to punish them. I think if a child can excel at both then we should encourage them to do so, but we must be reasonable. The coaches should realize that schoolwork comes first, and most coaches do, but the teachers can't expect an average student to do better work than they can possibly do before they participate in an activity that they care about. School should be about helping the students excel in all areas of life, and extracurricular activities help them to be well rounded, and gain confidence in themselves. The students are the politicians and scientists of tomorrow, but they are also the future sports stars, artists, and writers.

I believe that the school policy should not be changed.

It lowers the amount of players or students in each sport or activity, it ruins some of the students' dreams to become famous sports players, artists, or chess players, and is unfair.

Students should be able to join sports or other activities with at least a C average.

Most of the students have C averages so will not be able to participate in what they wish to do.

They should have a chance to join what they want to join.

Increasing the grade point average to a B average will effect the amount of students in each sport or activity.

The groups will lower because most of the students have a C average.

Also it will affect how many schools that our school will play against because we have smaller teams.

In addition it could affect the schools reputation because not many.

Other schools will know that the policy has been increased, and since there are less students the other schools and adults will think we do not give good education.

Not only is changing the policy going to affect the amount of students joining the sports or activities it will also affect the students dreams.

There are many students who want to become or may become the most famous sports player or artist in the country or maybe even the world.

Changing the policy will affect how students think about these things because they think that they are smart enough to join a sport or activity and it is not worth it anymore.

Each student who has a C average now will have their dream crushed.

One reason a student with a low grade average doesn't deserve to participate in activities is because if the principal allow them to play their grades may drop even more.

For example, If a student has a D in all his/her classes, and he is allowed to play, he may think that the principal doesn't care about his grades, and they may drop even lower. Most students care more about sports then their grades. That's why they should base students grades on whether or not they can participate in any activities.

Another reason is Because students with higher grade averages deserve to do fun things. For example, If a student has an A in all his/her classes they should be allowed to participate in activities.

If kids don't get to play sports or games they might not work even hard enough to get a c' s it would be d' s and f' s if the students get privileges they will work harder. What the school could do is set up events for all the students to do for a limited amount of time a day like 30 minuets before lunch. The teachers can just take more time on each lesson to make sure every one knows what to do.

Events can be used as an activity and a free time thing to do, but if students decide to play sports Instead of have the activity they can get a few friends and go play the sport of their choosing. It will be good to use to get students attention and to buckle down in school, and do their work so they can get rewarded. If they have work for a class they can go into their teachers class to get their work done and then they should be able to go play if they did not get in trouble all week.

every student deserves one chance to improve on there grades and to stay out of trouble. even the good kids mess up sometimes so all the students need to get a second chance.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I believe that this could be a good decision but may also be a bad one as well.

Many of the students that care only for there sports or other activities and that don't do very well in school will keep up with there work only because they want to do that one sport or other activity. This might separate the people who are really determined with there academic achievements and the people who only want to play there sport or activities. The people that only want to play there sport may drop out because being able to do that thing will be just another step harder ,while the people that want to do good in school will continue to do good.

It might be a good thing as well.

The people who ,not only want to play sports or other activities but are willing to do good in school will do better in school because of the worry that they might not be able to do this anymore. So this decision may benefit the school in a way.

If the principal considers the average grade to participate in sports and/ or activities should be raised she should at least give us the reasons she feels the average should be raised. I disagree with this because it puts on more work for the student wanting to join a sport, activity, or even both I feel the student shouldn't work so hard on his or her grade just so they can participate in a sport and\ or activity.

A question I have is what if a student has a bad average then realizes that he or she want to participate in something then finds out they don't like what they joined at all. Then the student will feel that they did real hard work for nothing and doesn't like the fact that their school makes students maintain a high average just to join and participate a sport and\ or activity. I mean who knows what that student might do maybe change schools or beg parents to go into independent studies or worst of all drop out just because they don't like the fact that they have to work so hard just to join a sport and\ or activity.

Sports are very important to many of our students but academics is far more important than any sport. Students need to learn to push themselves harder if they want the privilege of playing sports. Students should not be allowed to accept the minimum. The students are our next generation they need to learn how to be pushed. i am all for your change from a ""c"" average to a ""b"" average.

The athletes at our school are very talented athletically and academically but when it comes to academics they tend to slack. Athletes feel as though because they are captain of their basketball team or made the varsity football team they are on top so they don't need to try when it comes to academics...well they thought wrong. The academic average of a ""c"" for an athlete is way too low. Just how athletes are pushed when it comes the their sports, they should be pushed in academics as well. Letting athletes have a ""c"" average is saying you don't have to try because you'll make it anyways. When in fact that is not true. Athletes need to learn that if you push yourself in school you can make it just about anywhere.

Athletes aren't allowed just to do the minimum on the field or on the court so why should they be allowed to do the minimum in classrooms. Coaches tell their players to always give one-hundred and ten percent every time they go to play a game. If they do that there then why not in the classrooms?

Now one might say that not all athletes just sit back. Well I understand that. I do know that there are a handful of athletes who actually try their hardest to do well, so they might think that this isn't fair when in fact it is only helping them to do better and keep trying. You are not going to be the star of every game that doesn't mean that you shouldn't play right? Same way in the class, you are not always going to be the star student but you keep on trying until you are. Same as you do when you go to practice.

Now stop Worrying about what the slackers say because you are only helping them.

I don't agree with your decisions about the new school policy. I think that students needs exercise. I believe that students joining sports is a good thing for there health and it also makes them happy. Its not good for students to think about school work too much because it causes stress.

If you change your mind maybe more students would actually work hard in school because of there accomplishment's in school. Kids should be aloud to play any sport without doing anything.

If they think about school work and sports at the same time it might cause them to stress out. At the same time i also want them to have fun in school. There are lots of reasons why students shouldn't have to work hard just to play the sport they want. Changing school policy is a bad idea.

I think it will encourage kids to work harder in school. Not only it will encourage them they will also have a better future.

Changing the school policy back to normal would be a good thing for kids. They will also have a good exercise everyday because it encourage the to practice. I am also a sports fan my myself. I know how it feels if that happens to me.

Most of the students don't want you to change the policy of playing sports to a grade B average because there probably wont be many students in sports anymore and then we wont be able to have any sports because there is not enough kids for a football, basketball or volleyball teams and others because you have to have to have a certain amount of kids on a team to be able to play other schools.

Most students wouldn't like this idea because they wont be able to play sports because there grades are a C average or lower. If the rules got changed to a C average or higher then there wouldn't be as many students complaining about the change because most students don't get lower then a C average. I personally think we should change the rule to a B average. We should keep it the same or move the rules to a C average.

Most schools have a rule of that kids cant be failing any classes or getting into trouble like fights, detentions exc. I don't think we should change the rules at all because its hard enough for kids to keep there grades up where they are now because some kids are really struggling with them because maybe they don't get the subject that they're struggling in. Maybe in high school the principal can raise the average up to a C so kids can get better and be more independent and they can get into a good college or get a scholarship to a college that they really wanted but they couldn't afford it.

I have never heard of a school that has rules for playing sports to be at a B average I've only heard of schools having a policy of not failing any classes and not getting into trouble all the time. Most kids like to play sports and this would really bring them down because they probably wouldn't be able to play anymore because of there grades.

I hope you actually take in all this and see what it would do to other kids and show how it would effect the sports at school because there wouldn't be as many kids playing anymore. Most kids would stand up for what they believe in, and that's what I'm doing right now.

I agree that we should require at least a ""B"" average to be eligible to take place in extracurricular activities because our grades affect us in the long run throughout life.

D92FAEE355E1,"Dear Mrs. Principal:

I think this new school policy is great! Students with a grade C average should not be able to participate in sports or other activities. It makes students have to earn the right to play sports and do other activities. If they don't learn in the classroom, then they won't learn on the field. Also, students with a grade C average are not that smart. They might do dumb things at the activity and ruin the fun for others.

Students must earn the right to play sports and do other activities. They can't get a free pass out of jail. This isn't monopoly, this is life. When the students grow older, they have to earn everything they get. They don't get free money. They don't get a free house. They don't get a free car. Students should start to earn their way through life starting right now. If they don't start now, then they won't start later, and they'll have a miserable life.

Students must learn in the classroom before they step onto a field. They can't play sports without a brain. To get into a good college and play on their sports team, the students first need to have a brain. Then they need the athletic skills to back it up. Also, what will they do if they don't get to the big leagues? If the students didn't learn in school, then they get to live on the streets. Otherwise, they will get a good job and be happy.

Students with a grade C average are not that smart. Some will ruin the fun for others at the school activities. For example, a student who has a D average might think that starting a food fight at a carnival to cause ruckus will be fun. They didn't have the brain to realize that it will cause chaos and bring the whole place down.

So some people might disagree. They might say that some students that have a C average are really good athletes, and if they don't make the team, then the team will fail. Well that's too bad. Like I said, students need to earn it. I don't care if the team will perform poorly without the star player. This might motivate them to do better in school, and then everyone will win. Also, some people might say that they can't do any better. Their parents were dumb, and so were they. Look at that self-confidence. Change that pattern. If your parents aren't that smart, then you become smart, so that your kids will be smart.

The new policy is a great idea Mrs. Principal. I think it will help students become educated. and it will bring the school average up. So go ahead! Make this new policy official! It will help the lives of so many students!

F3ABEAC1432D,"Dear Principle,

I completely support you new policy. I believe that education is more important than extra circular activities. The only way a person can be successful is through education. Sports my make a successful person but the chances of that are very low. Education should be the most important priority in life, and for those who are not serious about their education, this could be a good incentive.

In every school you will find a group of kids who do not care for their education and are only interested in sports. Well, if these students cannot play sports because of their grades, they will be more driven to raise them. With these students raising their grades, other fortunate things may happen. These people could become more self controlled, and easily escape bad citations, like drugs or peer pressure. If this happens then our school would be full of determined, hard working students that play sports and also stay focused on their school and homework.

In all I believe that this would be a change that will effect the school in a positive way. This will make grades the #1 priority in our school, it will influence careless students to raise their grades, and it will fill our school a school with well rounded students.

First i want to say I am feel privileged to be able to see if i can change you mind. Hoping you can pick the right decision.

In my opinion you should not change the policy. You don't know if the students has a certain disadvantage and is not able to get higher grade. By not letting them play that may affect more greatly on there classes. Which can be a problem for them to move on to the next grade.

Another reason why you should not change the policy would be that students may use these activities to relax and focus on other things that are not school, schoolwork, parents , friends and other things.

The last reason not to change is you may prevent them getting scholarships or high school credits. Preventing them to a better future like colleges and a good job.

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I do and do not believe that students with a C average should or should not get to participate in activities and sports.

I do not believe this because the student is not yet failing and should still get a chance to do something he/she may love. I think that it is almost like a punishment or a bribe to the students. For example, telling kids that the only way you can play sports is to keep a B average. Another example is telling them that if you get a B average or higher you will get to play sports and participate in activities at school. A third example is saying to them, ""well you got a C on your report card so now you can not participate in sports or activities at school."" It may also not be fair to the student. That student may be trying his or her hardest to get the best grades he or she can get but still might only get a C. I don't think that's fair for the student. I can understand a student with a failing grade not being able to participate in school activities and sports, but a C, i do not think that is fair at all. The student might be really athletic and be a good player on the field and just because of a C average, why would we take away the opportunity. He or she might also have A' s and B' s in all of his or her subjects except one and in that last one have a C.

That is only one C average, they others are all great. I just do not think this is fair for the student.

Reasons that i think this is a good policy to have is because it will help kids keep there grades up in all classes and help to get OMS on the list of good schools in MA. It will also make the kids, their parents, and their teachers at school be happier. They will know that their students/children/themselves are doing great in school, they have at least a B average and are participating in school activities.

I hope you enjoyed my letter about reasons for students with a C average to be able to participate in school sports and reasons for them not to be able to. I honestly would not really care which happened. This policy is your decision and i think you should do what ever you want to do.

The idea kind of sounds unfair to others students that have D' s and F' s . I think kids with any grade point average or letter grade can participate in the sport they want to participate in. It would be really unfair to those who have the other two grades that can't participate in the sport they want to do for a school activity and for extra sports activity for their school to help support it in any way they can. Still students should have fun when they want to or not it would be fair to them if you just give us a chance to work hard and be healthy students that do whatever it takes to raise our grades to straight A' s or B' s and to achieve what we want to achieve. We want to fulfill our dreams and get a career like a teacher, pet doctor, doctor, designer, pet seller, or a famous singer/ dancer.

I strongly believe that you are making a big mistake by making the students have at least a grade B average to play in sports. If you have not noticed, there are those kids in school who are working very hard to attain the grade score that they are at now. Then there are those of us who spend so much time with sports, that we do not have time to be the best we can be in school. Of course, I realize that this is a stupid argument to make against you, saying that because of sports, students are failing. Then again you could see it my way. We are giving it everything we have to make sure that you attain a school championship. You see, those most passionate amongst us are the ones that aren't doing so well. They are trying, but they have dedicated so much time to this game that we cannot hope to achieve anything out of the ordinary in school. I hope that we can come to an agreement. Say, they must take a test of some sort to make sure that it is possible for them to actually achieve the level of scholarly intelligence that this school is now requiring. We are trying everything that we can to do well in school, but how can we ever hope to achieve our goals if we have so much constant pressure on us? We could get kicked off the team if our grades aren't good enough, but if we don't practice we might not be good enough for the team anyway!

You see, we are trying everything to stay on this team. We are either spending too much time on our homework and not practicing, or to much time practicing and not on our homework! I do not think that you should change the school policy because things are pretty great the way they are now. Everybody is getting along, nobody is fighting. The kids were fine with maintaining a grade C average. They had no problem with that. That is because at this age, when they are juggling relationships, body odor, sports, and everything else that has to do with adolescence, trying to get good grades could really stress them out. In all sincerity, it is true that they don't need to have so many things to get worked up about. They don't specifically need all the other things, but they don't care. For some, sports is all they care about. It is what keeps them alive. It's what makes them want to come to school, the fact that they will be able to play sports after it will be over. Some of these kids didn't come from great families. Some may be suicidal. Some just are not capable of getting a grade B average. Nothing was wrong with the old policy.

Now back to something that I mentioned earlier. I said something about a test. This test can be a one time thing, or you can have us take it once a semester. Whatever makes you feel better. I realize that there are state standards and such, but some kids just don't meet those standards. They try very hard to, but they can't. If you were to change the policy, I suggest making a test that covers all the subjects. Make it to see if these kids are capable of actually doing the work. Give these kids a fair chance. If you just change the school policy without anybody's consent or making it very unfair to people, people will start to get mad. They will not be happy with the decision that you made. I suppose that I have no power over your decision, but I hope that you can see things from my point of view. At least just to analyze it. I know that maybe we aren't matching up to the standards and that's why you're planning on changing the school policy, but you have to realize that some of these kids just can't make it. We try very hard. Like I said at the beginning, some of us spend more time training than with schoolwork. Others of us more time with schoolwork than training.

My opinion is that students with a C grade average can definitely play sports. They don't have to have a B grade average. A C is a passing grade therefore they should be allowed to perform in sports. They might even be really smart so you wouldn't have to worry for their future. What if school isn't really their ""thing"". By making students with a ""C"" grade average not participate in sports you may ruin there future. They could of been the new ""Michael Jordan"" or something ""big"" like that.

Students that have C grade average are passing school there is no need to hold them back in sports. They deserve to have fun too. They've been trying hard to keep there grades up to a C so they can play in sports. If you change the school policy it wouldn't be fair for them since they put all that effort before you decided to consider changing it.

Some students that have a C may be really skillful. Maybe they're just having some difficult subjects. For example, Albert Einstein didn't get a good grade average in school but as you know he is one of the smartest guy that's ever lived. I think you should give them a break and let them have fun at sports if they want to.

Maybe one of those C average kid becomes a famous basketball player or som e other sport.

I agree with your idea. I have fun at school and partake in activities, and I get good grades. I couldn't see why someone might get bad grades, unless they don't bother to pay attention. I have a few reasons why I think this is a good thing.

First of all, I think raising the grade you have to have to play sports to a B would challenge some students to become better learners and actually to apply themselves. this would be a very good thing for the student, and his/her future, and also the schools reputation. these are very important things you want to do in life.

Secondly, I think that when you raise the grade to play sports, it makes the players feel more honored to play. They feel after having to do all the work, it payed off and they get their reward. When a student has this feeling it makes them appreciate what they did instead of blowing off the work, and not gaining any intellect.

Lastly, I think if this is done, it would make the C or D average slackers who don't feel it is necessary to notice the adult's authority, might become more of a mature person.

The blunt actions made by the adults could ""smack"" some sense into some students, and make them realize their mistakes.

Overall, raising the grade to play sports is a good thing. Making forceful actions and rules can make a difference on the community's kids. This action could provoke an increase in kids awareness in their grades. One small action can make a difference.

I believe that only allowing students with a grade average of at least a B is unfair. Students should be able to participate in the activities they enjoy no matter what, and they should not be discriminated if their grades aren't at the tip of the peak.

There are few sources in town besides school that these kids can take part in a sport or other activity, and taking away their activities that they enjoy is taking away their rights.

If a student has low grades, but loves basketball with all their heart, It would be terrible to take that away from them. Everybody is good at something, and bad at others, it's part of being human. A student may not have the best grades, because education may be their weakness and athletics is their strength.

I believe that in the long run, it is important that a student is successful in their future life. If someone was set on pursuing an athletic career, why do they have to have excellent grades in classes. As long as they are trying their best in school, they deserve their rights. A proper education is very important for success, but if they are the best in what they want to do for the rest of their lives, that should be all that matters.

What may improve the grades of athletes is scheduling practices at convenient times, which allow them to get all their school work completed before practice. Doing so will allow the students to focus more on their work. Another option is to cut practices shorter. If they are not as long, students will have more time to do the things they need to in order to help their grades.

It is important that kids stay healthy and active, and not allowing them to play sports is depriving them of exercise that is needed for them to grow. People who exercise on a regular bases are happier people, and of course, healthier people.

As you can see we are better off having the sports grades up to a 76% because not only do we have good education we also have good sports.      ",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
6FA1253A087F,"Dear Principal,

I have heard about your new policy regarding, who can participate in sports.

I believe, that making sports only available to grade B average students is a great idea.

Many students who participate in sports don't believe that it is important to keep their grades up because, they are focused only on their sports.

School sports are very time consuming and can affect a students sleep and amount of time allowed to spend on homework.

Practices after school can take away from homework time and force students to start your homework late at night.

It depends on the student to decide what is more important homework or sleep?

Having games is a whole other story, sports games are usually in the evening and if you live far from school this can prove to be a problem for many students.

By the time you arrive at your home it could already be ten o'clock and this will definitely affect your sleep.

If, only grade B average students were allowed to participate, students who participate in sports programs would push themselves to academic excellence.

With more students trying hard to succeed in their studies, the school would become a smarter place.

also, since many of the students only have a C average the will be motivated to raise their grades in school.

Our school would benefit from this new policy and the students attending would too.

I am sure that teachers would also enjoy their students working harder and participating more in class.

I strongly disagree with your positioning, this is because I myself love sports and i don't think that should be up to you if we can participate in sports depending on our grades. Also because for some people sports may help them improve their grades. My last reason for disagreeing with you is because you don't know what's happening at our house or why our grades are the way they are. Sports is like a way out for some kids and you can't just take that away due t o an average of a C. If you know most kids in your school have an average of a C then why would you go and not allow most kids to join?

It shouldn't be up to you if student participate or not due to grades you should leave that up to our parents. I absolutely understand that you want kids to have better grades and what not but still if a students parent did think the sport would make their grades decline even more then they most likely would tell them to get the grades up before joining. Disregarding sports for right now, what about other activities that's not fair to student who are apart of ski club, chess club, or any other club they all have reasons why they do what they do.

Some of the sports or activities may help some improve on grades; like myself. It gives some a sense of pride like they are apart of something great so not allowing them to participate due to an average, that's just not fair. And you are aware that most kids who try out or join something wouldn't be doing so because most kids have and average of a C. Most student don't like sharing their personal problems with counselors or things like that so they do what they like best to get away from it all. I know i keep saying ""it's just not fair to take away these things due to an average of C for most kids"" but i really don't think you understand what these activities mean to some students. It's a way to make friends, talk with friends, have fun and joke around, and be yourself. Instead they need to bring their average up one more letter grade.

Do you go home with every student at night and deal with what ever problems they may have going on? I didn't think so. So why would you go and take away something that makes them happy and expresses them self? Kids need good grades to get into college and have good paying jobs; yes we get it but. Good grade and fun activities as a reward but some kids don't want to have to go home and do homework for 1 hour at night to participate in things. The kids who have above a C average probably (not saying they do) do ALL their work and more cause they don't want to do any extra things. But that's their choice we're all different.

What I'm try to say is it shouldn't be up to you what we do, and these extra things may help some with grades and along with that is you don't know or understand what's revolving around each individual student at your school, the activities may be a way for them to escape the drama, the everything that is happening in their life at the time.

Sports should be for everyone, but, I do think you should lower the standard's for the school, only because you don't have to be smart to play a professional sport when you grow up, so it's just like your giving the not-so-smart kids no kind of chance. They may be really good at sports. I think they should have to have a C- average. Just to give everyone I chance in doing a sport. Or set a specific grade point average, like my school does, you have to have a 2.0 or over to play a sport. Which I think is perfectly fine. We have really good players. And plus, maybe the really smart students aren't that good at football, or basketball, or other sports. Maybe they have more important stuff to do then practice, like homework. That's why I think you should lower your standards, or just set a specific grade point average because it wouldn't be fair to the kids that are really good, but don't do that well in school. Maybe they just have personal issues, or something. You shouldn't exclude them from any sport activities. Maybe they'll go pro one day.

A4266A92A0C5,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

My name is STUDENT_NAME and I am writing this letter today to tell you that I completely agree with what you plan to do. It would greatly help society if there was a B average policy on sports. Here are just a few reasons why i believe you should increase the grade average for sports: help teams with teaching sports, increase students intelligence, and build a smarter society.

The first and one of the most important reasons why the grade average should be raised is so the coaches for the sports team can better explain how to play the sport safely and properly to the players. With a higher average students that sign up will be smarter if they have to maintain a B average rather than a C average. Also, it can help Coaches better explain the way to play the sport and how to do things more properly and how to do it a safely as they possibly can . Lastly, it can give each team a more fair chance to win a game.

Next, with a higher average students would have to do better in school. With the average raised students would have to strive to do their absolute best in class in order to play the sport that they desired to play. It will help the students become much smarter in school because they will more than likely have to study more for tests and pay more attention in school. Lastly, it will give students less time to goof off or mess around in school or at home due to the average being raised.

Finally, quite possibly the most important reason for raising the grade average to a B is to build a more sophisticated society. I myself play sports and notice how many people actually play them and if the grade average was raise then I know that all the people I see playing sports are smarter than they were before because they had to do better in school. It would also make the kid/teenager population increase in terms of being more sophisticated. Lastly, if the grade average was raised then it would increase students smartness, but as well as showing that your school is a higher educated school and more than likely will appeal to families and they would want their child to attend at your school because they want the highest education possible.

Increasing the grade average to a B would by far make the community much smarter. Many kids at a Junior High level play sports and with the average being raised they will all be more intelligent than in previous years. Helping Coaches, Increasing students sophistication, and creating a smarter society are just a few of the many reasons why increasing the grade average is a tremendous policy.

I think having students that cannot part take in sports, unless they have a

B average is outrageous! Students express themselves in sports, B average or not. If my pupils are wonderful at sports but have a C average, and are not allowed in sports is a waste. All that talent would be thrown away if you keep the policy.

Students all want to do something that they love. It keeps there spirits high and they have a good childhood life. I wouldn't want to have a school that is always under the weather because they cant play sports. Kids need time to burn off all there energy to keep them fit and strong. Just having B average or above kids be able is not going to benefit the school in anyway.

Students need motivation in order for them to keep there school work up. If they cant play sports then there grades will drop even lower. The student will feel depressed and confused, if they cant do something that they love. To take away sports for some kids will make them feel like they have had a part of them torn out of them.

The students will work harder if they are in sports. They would want to keep there grades up in hope for a scholarship. Brain cells need activity in order for them to function right. Sitting down all day is tiring and boring. Having all student be able to play sports would also mean less fights. When you are active you burn off those emotions. Students will have a more tight schedule if they play sports and keep there grades up. This will mean less time for goofing off and having bad actions.

I am writing to respond to the idea of a policy that athletes must maintain a B average to play sports.

I am in agreement with you for the most part.

However, I do have a few suggestions.

As I mentioned before, I believe that your proposed policy is reasonable and should be implemented.

It is right to expect that students maintain a B average.

We, the students, should be held responsible for our decisions.

This policy would require more effort by part of students, which I feel is appropriate.

This makes sense because our creed if you will, VISA (value respect, include everyone, serve others, and accept responsibility) has as part of it, accept responsibility.

That said, I do propose that we give added support these students, a tutoring program.

If we add a tutoring program they are more likely to succeed.

While we do have Jumpstart, the students who go are required to go there and the others who may still need help are left out.

If this new tutoring program requires some time to set up, I would ask that you put the policy into affect next year, so that we may set up this program.

If we require higher standards we should encourage and help our students to achieve them, not set them up to fail.

In conclusion, I believe that we should have this B average policy, but that we should add a means of support.

I appreciate your time and interest in student opinion.

I believe no they should not have to have a b average

My first reason why is if you hade to have a b+ average a lot of students could not reach that so there would not be many kids participating in the school activities so if there where not a lot the teams would be un even (A lot would not have a varsity, JV team) So it would be pointless for many schools to even have sports.

One of the reasons is the average should not be in general it should be where your talking about because if you talking about inner city kids that don't have a lot to get for them self's like school work so it would be harder for them to keep up with the other schools and if you talking about higher end schools yes the average should be a b+ because they have everything they need to pass school and if they don't then its there fault for behind lazy at school

My least but best reason is that the schools should be at a b+ average are proble the smaller schools because the ratio would be easier to have a b+ school when you only have 100 kids i go to SCHOOL_NAME and we have atleast 1000 kid's and it would be hard for the few people to try to keep the b+ average up.

Finally its just not fair to students that have bad grades but are good and intelligent that they have to improve to be able to participate in a activity.

But some students try even harder than students that have an A but they can only get a C. Its not easy to get a good grade you have to try but sometimes when you try your hardest it doesn't work out.

I believe that the policy our principal is trying to make is a good idea because, if you do not put in enough time to do your homework and study for a test then why should you be able to waist valuable study time on a sport and end up with a D or an F?

Students should maintain at least a C average to be able to play sports.

If there was a kid who got a scholarship to a college for sports, which is good, but only for sports and he failed most of his classes, where would he go in life?

School is supposed to prepare you for a good future and help you make good decisions.

Also, since only a fraction of all careers are sports related and only a fraction of people will make them, a kid should have a good education.

Also, if you were just as good as a kid at, lets say basketball, but he was failing and you had an A.

Would you enjoy it if that kid got to start and you didn't?

How about if you were a straight A student, and you made High Honor Role, then the school has an awards ceremony, and you didn't get an award, but the highest scorer on the basketball team did?

I think that the principal's decision would be a good one for all the students and their futures.

I don't think you should only let kids with a B average participate in sporting events because if the schools kids are averagely get C' s shouldn't you just have it that way.

If you take sporting events away from the kids with C' s on average then you will be taking the sport away fro your school if the B average kids only play. You will be doing that because if the schools students are averagely getting C' s then there wont be that much to make a team with and the teams will keep loosing there will be no more teams if the teams keep loosing. So that's why you should not raise the requirement to a B average or else no teams what so ever.

Also you should not change it because if you put this much stress into kids they will not be able to do assignments. The reason is say you really want to join a spot or activity but its hard to get your grade up so you try to do your work fast to get it done faster to do more if you keep doing that you are sure to not do them well and you will fail even more.

I disagree with your idea for many reasons. First, most students have a C average so most students would not be able to play even if they are the next Michael Jordan. Second, this change would nearly cut the amount of players in half so you would not have as many kids participating in sports. And third, it only hurts the school by not having as much talent on the team.

Most students in the school have a C average, so they wouldn't be able to play. If a kid has outstanding athletic ability and has a C, that is terrible because he wont be able to show maybe his only or best talent he has. Only because he is not getting a high enough average.

This change would also cut the amount of players. It would hurt the school by not having as many people participating in school sports. This amounts to not as many people supporting the team and showing up to games. For example, if someone has a lot of friends his/her friends will come to the games to support them. But then if the player cant play on the team, those friends have nobody to cheer on specifically and wont come.

Lastly, it would only be the school's loss if there is not as many players. If all of the best athletes on the team have a C average, then you don't have as much talent and the team wont do as good. Then the school team wont have a good record because they don't have all of their best talent out there.

Overall, i strongly disagree with this. I think it would have a large effect, but only in a negative way. It would take away talent, and I just don't see any good in doing this. If you can find a reason why this change would help, let me know. I will be surprised if there is a decent reason why to change the policy.

I think that people who maintains a B average should join any sports or any other activities because it shows that they can balance school work sports, and other activities People sometimes put sports first than school work, In some schools, the students need at least 2.0 gpa to join any type of sports. If they do have a C average, they should try hard to get it up to a B average. I think it seems fair that the standards to be active in sports is having a B average, because if the standards were a C average then maybe some students might not give 100% effort on their work. Also usually a C average can drop down fast. I know that many students can reach a B average if they try, and if they maintain a B average then they don't have to worry. Being in a sport is a privilege , its an opportunity but it comes with consequences. If you don't have a B average then you can't join any sports. I know a person who is in a volleyball team, she works super hard in volleyball and she still has time to do all her homework. She's only in ninth grade and she can already balance time on her school work and practicing on volleyball. She loves volleyball so if she drops her 2.0 gpa. she knows she can get kicked off the team, that's why she perseveres to maintain a 2.0 gpa. So you see, maintaining a 20. gpa. or a B average is important to get in a sport or do fun school stuffs because if they can't maintain good grades then they can't have the privilege of joining a sport or joining clubs

We definitely should not go through with this horrific idea. Your team sports will quickly lose many athletes and will probably not have enough players to even start. Many kids do have a C average that are excellent football, basketball, soccer, tennis, or softball players. Some kids can't help their learning skills as well as others. It definitely wouldn't be fare to the kids.

If I had to guess your schools athletic programs would not be very successful, do to the loss of players to the team. you will see your teams record, stat's, and even fan base decrease because of the loss of talent and depth in your depth chart.

487A91198C6E,"I agree with the principal. It is important that students work hard in school. They aren't in school to play sports, they are here to learn. Playing sports is a privilege we get in middle school and high school. In my opinion, we need education before sports, this is not a right we have to play sports, but a privilege, and the point of school it to learn, not athletic activities.

Many students may disagree with the principal with having to maintain a B average to participate in sports. I am not one of those students. Students who have worked hard to get their grades up and have the B average or higher deserve the spot in the sport, if they are good enough. Kids who slack off during class don't deserve the chance to take part in a sport. It isn't fair to the kids who have work so hard for all of their lives.

I have friends who think that no matter what, even if their grade drop, they will make the team or stay on the team. No coach needs that student that badly. It is not something you just get to do. You need good grades. It is a privilege to play sports. If the students really want to participate in them, they need to work harder!

School is a place of learning, not sports. Yes, sports are a part of school, but it's not the main focus. The student education is what is most important. We need to keep it that way. If the principal gives in to the students who think it's okay to have under a B average and play sports, then the rest of the county will think that we don't care about education. They will think all we care about is being good at sports. That is not the reputation we want for this school.

The principal needs to stick with his rule. Playing sports needs to be earned. It will teach students to go for what they want, and really work. Kids should know that not everything is his or her right, some things you must earn. Education comes first, other things come second.

students should not be allowed to participate in a sport or activity only if they are failing one or more classes.

also that will allow more students to participate in a sport/activity. this will also benefit the school.

Another reason not to change the policy the students need the exorcise to stay on task-forces during the school day.

by changing this policy that will have less students participating in a sport/activity so less students will be fit and on task during the school day. kids on and average day need a lest and hour of movement having sports/activty more available to the students can really benefit the students health. also discipline students need something to do after school in the winter allowing there be more flexibility in the grade average. more students will be getting into less trouble with police and there parents. because they'll have something to do.

sports/activitys also allow students to talk to each other and make friends. socializing is needed to get to know people and also make friends. socializing is also a part of being healthy you need to interact with other people and get ready for the real world. so by working on your people skills know is important sports/activtys can benefit that.

E125A0E0FD41,"I believe this would be unfair. Students need sports so that they can get exercise. Not only that, if students sat inside all day doing homework, reading, and playing video games, they would become overweight and depressed. Sports also allow students to develop a social skills so they won't be lonely or even worse made fun of. Childhood obesity is already at an all-time high. Plus, I believe school already has too much control over our own lives, they try to tell us what is good and bad and what we should and shouldn't do. Students and parents should be able to makes decisions that are best for the student.

Sports are a good way for students to blow off steam from everyday life. Life is hard as a teenager, peer pressure and other things make it even harder. Students are pressured to do well by their parents, and as a reward for succeeding, they get to play sports. If they don't succeed, parents have the right to take sports from them, but not schools. Also, it may be the schools fault for failing student. Some schools don't have sufficient enough help for the student, or the teacher could not be doing their job correctly.

On the other hand, middle schools with their own sports programs can do this. If the student has a failing grade, they could be placed on extracurricular probation.

I feel it would be right to have the students have a B or above average to play sports and other activities. If a student would be forced to make better grades to do what he/she wants to do it would bring the school and their grades up. Most students like other activities way more than regular school work. But if they would be forced to make better grades to do those activities I think it would help them better themselves. That way the student would get used to keeping their grades up instead of being given an ultimatum.

This would probably affect other things like the students behavior and attitude. The way it would help their attitude is if the student has to pay attention to his or she work they wouldn't have time to goof off and get in trouble and disrupt class. Another way it could help improve is the school's grades if the student kept a b or above average at all times it could improve the way it looks on the school.

The students would also be helping themselves by keeping good grades which could give them more possibilities ahead.

If the student kept good grades which would enable them to participate in activities they would become more well rounded.

Dear Principle,

I have heard that you would like to change the grades needed to participate in sports. I have a few arguments and points that I would like to bring to your attention.

Point A: I know that you would like students to have good grades, AND be able to play sports. Well, as an athlete I know how hard being on a school team can be. You have practice everyday, games are far away, and you still have to complete your homework and maintain your grades to be at least a C. Some of the best athletes are sometimes not so great at school, and if they get a C, are you telling me that you are going to take away what they ARE good at? Let's say for one week they get a C+ which is an 83-84% average, one-two points below a B, are you still going to take them out of basketball, or tennis, or whatever sport it may be? I can understand you taking out a player if he/she has a D, that's different, but for a C? In my opinion, that's a little unfair.

Point B: By raising the grade to a B, you may actually take away motivation, not instill it. They could either decide to not play, they could quit because they think they can't do it, they could switch to a recreational league, or they could sit the bench by choice of not working. By having a C average for your requirement grade, they will feel better about getting and maintaining that grade.

Point C: If many students at the school have a C average, they know that they can maintain that grade. If all of a sudden you raise the average to a B, you are not only going to lose kids that are active in sports and other groups, you are going to have kids that might possibly lose interest in school altogether. With all respect, it would be a stupid decision to change the grade. Here's another thing. For some kids, its ALL about activities and sports, and if that's taken away from them, they are going to lose interest even more than they already have.

Point D: Have some school spirit. If you take away the athlete's chances of being on the team just based on having a B or not, then you are taking away pride. Think of it this way, you take away the good athletes on the team, equals your school losing games, equals lower school pride, and the athletes' self esteem goes down.

I would really love you to consider not doing this policy, because of the effects it could have on our school. Thank you.

I believe you should be able to go and play sports if you maintain lower than a c.

Also i believe you should be able to play if you don't turn in your homework. or miss a day in practice because you are sick i really do believe if you get lower than a c grade average you should not be able to play also because some people just cant not get there grade up in science or math but its one thing if your failing a class and are trying you should be able to play if you are trying and getting help but still just don't get it.

I am writing this letter to inform you that we the students of SCHOOL_NAME are against the school policy about having a B average to be able to participate in sports or in other school activities. I think we should at least have a C average to participate. A C average is good to be eligible for sports. I think that when a student participates in a school activity and has a grade below a C, he should have time bring his grade up in school. If that student has a D in one subject and the rest C and above he should work hard to raise his D up so he can be on a sport team. These are reasons why i think the activity participation should be a C average.

With people averaging a B and above there wouldn't be many people that could do sports. Most kids have a C. A c is okay to have. It's not failing. It's passing. There would be many more people if you let them have a C. It may even make the team better.

I think that students should not need to have an average of a B or better. A lot of kids that play sports have a C average. I think a B average is a little too high of an average for some students. Instead, I think that kids should have at least a C average. Having a B average is too high for some students because lots of students have at least Bs and Cs. So their average maybe on the lower side of B or maybe a high C. I think that if students get lower than a C average, then they can't play on a sports team. I think that because if they don't try in school then they don't play on their sports team. School comes before sports and if they won't try in school, then they shouldn't be able to play a sport. Playing a sport is an opportunity for students. If it is abused, then it should be taken away from them. Also I think that kids who have a C average or better should be able to play a sport because getting a C is still a good grade. Even though it's not the best grade, they still try in school. But if a student doesn't try and gets lower than a C average, those students shouldn't be able to play. It's not fair to the students who want to play and get the good grades. But I think that the students with lower than a C average shouldn't get kicked off of the team. I think that the student should be able to get back on the team once they get a better grade average. It may take some time, but if they really want to play, then the student will work hard to get their grade up.

I would like to advise you of many student's responses, and argue amongst the possible policy of requiring at least a B average to participate in sports. As i am sure you are aware, many of the students already participating in sports with a below B average, are dearly upset. School work can be tough at times, and everybody deserves a chance.

The policy "" You must have a B average to participate in sports"" should be abolished. Many sport members participate to earn scholarships, physical health, and a source of entertainment and gratitude. It has been reported that many of my fellow classmates have been grieving over this new rule. Most of them have a ""C"" average. 70%-79% What if someone was just at the near cusp? This could be intriguing to many who just barely didn't make the grade. Yes, i do know it is tremendously important to keep on your grades at all times to be able to succeed in life, but when your this age there are more important things.

The many advantages of outdoor sports. This provides the chance to believe in yourself that you can succeed in anything you participate in. It makes you think bigger, and lets your imagination run wild of all the possibilities that can be accomplished. Sports also allows participants the chance to be physical and active. This guarantees that you will learn healthy habits, as well as staying fit. This gradually can decrease the national problem we are facing in modern day; Obesity.

The issue obesity, needs much more attention then it gets. This is something that really needs the help of the American society. But why? Why are so many children obese? Lack of physical activity and healthy lifestyle habits, that's why. Studies show that if you participate in school sport activities, you are guaranteed to be healthier and fit.

Most students grades are falling below a B average. For some, they are just barely passing! Why would you take away the benefits of sports away from children of our society? We all know good grades are very important, but i believe as long as your trying your

""Personal Best"" Then you should at least let students participate as long as they have a passing grade. We very dearly appreciate all you do for our school. We all know you try your best to do as much as you can for us, but sometimes it goes over our limits.

I do think it's fair to let only B average students play sports or other fun activities because have they do their work and focus a lot in school. If you let some with an F average play, it won't be fair to let him play than someone with an A average. F average students don't really care about school or doing their work, because of sports and activities; they focus too much on other things than school. On the other hand, students with a good GPA focus on school and on what they have to do. Most coaches i know would much rather prefer someone that's an average player but gets good grades, than the best player who has low grades. If you don't have good grades, it won't get you anywhere in life, except maybe working at a fast food restaurant making minimum wedge.

One thing i do disagree on with you is the B average. I'd think at least a C average student is worthy of playing or doing fun activities. I know they may not be the smartest people but they might have potential to start doing better in school. If I was the coach, I'd keep that C average kid on check with his grades, and as soon as they start dropping, I'm going to kick them off the team.

I myself might be around like a C average student and will do better in school. My dad won't even tolerate a C- because he says it's pretty much a D. Both my parents have me on check and as soon as they hear that I was misbehaving, or not doing my work, that's it, no more sports, games or privileges to out with my friends until I pick up my grades.

But, all I'm asking for is to let at least a C average student play sports or activities in school, they might be perfect A+ students, but most try hard to do their work, and deserve a chance to participate in extra-curricular activities.

The school policy should not be changed. Students should only have to get at least two C' s in order to not be able to participate in a sport. The reason for this is that some students do not like a certain subject because they're not good at it. If they fail a subject and they're not good at the subject they wouldn't be able to play a sport they really like. If they have to only have two C' s in order to not be able to not participate in a sport it would show the student needs to study a bit more so they can participate he their favorite sport.

Most students get good grades and they get bad grades, if they have to have at least one C in order to not be able to participate in a sport, many students wouldn't be able to play sports.

I don't think that is a right thing to do on our benefit because we try. We as children or teens do our best hoping that you will accept it... but our best is not enough? students have a grade C and cant participate in school activities I don't think that's a way to run a elementary school. I don't think the school policy should change.

If students don't have daily activities like sports and things how do you expect them to be physical and active during class. With out activities how are students going to stay in shape. their are more reasons to support this. Like students cant have physical education and they cant have any sports team. What parent would want to send their child to a school like that.

The students need time that's all. The principal of the school needs to have patience with the students of that school. If you were to give it some time then maybe the grades will go up even higher then expected. Children of our age group work at their own paste so give them a chance. Don't take away the school activities and the grades will get better.

In conclusion, it is not the right thing to do if you decide to take it away. Different school are getting better because of patience. Also some schools are getting worse because teachers and principals are being hard on the students. Don't take the activities away it would work in the beginning but in the end it will be a mess.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I have heard of the idea you've developed on how a c average determine wether a student has the ability to play sports or not. I do think that grades should effect student's athletic privileges, but that is if a student fails a class or multiple classes. Failing deserves no privileges and a c average is not failing. A c average is between 70 and 79 and failing is 69 and below. I do not think that the idea that you came up with should be enforced on student athletes. I think if a student athlete works hard enough but still does earn grade of a c in a class they deserve to participate in sporting activities because they still put forth all of their ability to pass the class.

I also don't think the idea should be passed because i just finished up basketball season and towards the end of basketball i had a c in us history class if the idea you have would have been passed i wouldn't of been able to finish the season with the team and help win our last game.

I do not agree with the new policy. I find it unfair that students with a grade C average are not allowed to compete in school sports. I think it should be up to their parents whether they should play or not. The school needs to know that getting a C average is normal. C stands for average, B is good, and A is Excellent. Sports are for exercise and they help you stay in shape. Some of the reason that we have obesity in America is because schools don't let kids that have bad grades play sports. In college your grade point average needs to be above a 2.0 to play sports. That is reasonable.

In middle school your grade really isn't getting recorded. Colleges do not look at your middle school grades. They actually don't start looking at your grades until high school. In high school they look at your grades and sports. In middle school they don't look at anything. There is no reason that we should not be allowed to compete in extra curricular activities. That is what colleges want to see. They want to see what you do out of school. They don't want a misbehaved late teenager coming to their school to disrupt class. Some kids are like that, they are very smart in school but they misbehave during class and get into trouble at home.

Sports also keep us out of trouble. Which would you rather us do, play video games, get fat, and do drugs, or would you rather have us stay in shape and be well behaved. I think you would rather have us be well behaved. Sports are fun, school is not. You wonder why it is so hard for us to concentrate and do well. Its because we are so pressured into doing well that it makes it no fun. Sports are fun because you get to relax and not worry about school for just a little while. We have way more school than sports, can't you give us a little freedom. It isn't like whenever we aren't playing sports we are studying or doing homework. We have extra time to play sports, why can't we use it?

I agree with your decision that you have to have a B average in school to participate in sports and other activities. There are a couple of reasons why this would help the school and the students become a better community.

For one it would set a higher standard for students, which would make them try harder in school. Athletes that would want to play sports would then put academics first and athletics second, which is important.

This would also make it so that the athletes would be determined to strive in both school and sports, which makes for better people. Plus people that want to play sports but don't have a B average, would realize that you have to try hard at something to earn something rewarding. Students are led to believe that a C or even a D is okay, but it will not get you far in life, so this project will help kids realize how much more they can achieve and accomplish with better grades.

Another reason is that this would boost the overall GPA for the school and get the school more recognition. A lot of middle school students want to play a sport (or sports), at a young age and are also encouraged to be active by their parents and their community. So if a lot of students want to play sports and be on a team they also want to have good grades to be able to play on the team. If the school had a better overall GPA it would get more recognition and awards from the community and the students would get more rewards for their academics and their athletics.

So therefore I agree with your choice and I think it will help the staff, the students, and the community to become a better place.

I think it is great that you wish students will need to improve there grades to do sports but, some students are not capable of getting up to a B in their average. I have decided that you should give them work do to for extra credit.

This would be a great way for students to participate in sports. If they refuse to do the extra credit then have them raise their grade on their own. Another thing i think would be great is if you could hold an after school tutoring class for them after school. Also if they refuse that then i guess they wont get to try out for sports.

I think if you don't give these students a chance with this opportunity they wont be capable of ever trying out for sports unless you go for this decison. The extra credit or tutoring will help improve their grades so they will have a chance in an activity that they are interested in.

Once the students have improved there grades with this opportunity and don't try hard to keep it that way then you should not let then volunteer in this sport. A good thing about this decision is that they are doing physical activity and that is a good process for a child to have. Another decision I have thought of is Maybe change the average B down to a C in volunteering for sports.

This decision is a great way for a child to express themselves in what they like in sports.

I am arguing with the principal by playing sports or activities unless they have a B average. I say this because a C average is satisfactory. Which is not really good. If students want to do sports or activities and they want to get a B or higher, this makes the students work more harder to get up to a B or higher and play sports. So it is putting pressure on them to work more harder. The students have the privilege to participate in sports , it has to come with requirements. Also by changing the policy , students will have a good grade and they are doing sports or activities. They will not have to worry about there grade a B instead of C or lower.

Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I understand that as an experienced teacher you may see that many students are making a C average, but does that really mean that you have to take away our sports and activities? There could be many young athletes that you don't even know exist, therefore you should not take away the privileges of young future athletic scholars.

These sports also could relieve stress for some of the students. By you taking their ability to relieve stress away they may even do worst in school and you're going to wonder why. I believe that students who score at least a 75% should attend sports, but by making only B average attend is not fair in my eyes. These students may have a lot on their mind minds as far as school comes , but there are athletes sitting right in the classrooms not doing anything , BECAUSE they cant attend any athletic activities.

I do understand that as a principle you may see something completely different. Just think about if you were a student, how would you feel if you got the only thing you love to do taken away because you have a 79% percent? This is why I argue that students should be aloud to attend any sport they'd like because they have a 75% average or higher in all of they're classes.

All in all please consider not making this a required rule.

You should be ashamed of yourself for even considering not letting kids have what they need! Sure lot's of people say you don't NEED exercise, but honestly we all do actually need it. We need to have the running, and strength that our gym teachers provide us. And just forcing it away because of lousy grades, which we can fix easily, is just cruel!

Gym helps build muscles. When you take it away because of grades, not only are you letting kids become obese, but you are also taking away what strengthens them.

They need to start from the beginning like everyone else to build up strength like everyone else. Don't take away what we need the most.

Dear Principle,

Hello. I have recently heard the news that you are thinking about not allow students to participate in sports unless they have a B average. I think that it's a fair policy and I could not agree more with your thoughts.

I agree with you because many students that play sports as a middle school student will most likely not be a professional athlete, due to the very tough competition. Therefore, I believe that students should have at least a B average in school, so that later on, if they decide they are going to quit sports, they will still be able to succeed towards the academics side. If they only focus on sports from an early age, but later realize they're not good enough to be a professional, their futures of getting jobs will most likely to be difficult. No matter what job a person receives, they require some sort of basic skill in any of the subjects taught in school. So in case they don't succeed as a professional athlete, I think it's very important that students receive good grades in their education today.

If they start to earn C' s and other below-average grades starting from middle school, there is a better chance that they will most likely do the same in high school and college. I believe that whatever they major in college, there is always some sort of education involved. And what kind of good parent doesn't want their child to go to a college and become successful? Students should start to bring their grades up now, so they can start getting into the habit, that will help them throughout the rest of their lives.

Let's say that students who are involved in sports right now, do become professional athletes in their future. Even if they do, the basic skills of subjects like language arts and math are still needed. If as middle school students, they decide their careers as athletes, if they don't have the basic skills, I can guarantee they will have problems, even as an athlete. You will need your reading skills for situations like signing a contract, or math skills for when paying bills or counting up your money. Even as an athlete, you need the basic knowledge, so I think it's important that a student has these skills and properly learn them when they have the chance.

As you can see, education is very important, regardless of what activities a student is involved in. It doesn't matter where that student decides to go in their future, they will always need the basic education. I believe that students should raise their grades up before they regret it in their future, so I hope you do change the policy, for the better.

Many students already told me that their parents are thinking of calling and unless you want to be getting phone calls all day by mad parents I would say you should change it. For many students sports and after school activities is what keeps them out of trouble. Also parents sometimes can't pick up there child/children after school and this gives parents time to pick them up and something for their child to do after school.

Kids won't be able to pull off both and we will be left without any sports teams or anything else. Do you want that to happen? Yes, academics are important. But, some kids can't do that well and depend more on after-school activities to get a good career.

Many of my friends here at school say if you raise the bar, they will try to go to a different school. Some would still be able to play out of those kids and some wouldn't. If you raise the bar, you will lose students. Other schools will take them in and win all the different sports and debates while our school can't even PARTICIPATE! That will become detrimental too this school. Parents will send there kids too every where else and take there kids out. The school will eventually be shut down, and you will lose your job.

In the policy containing that students should not have a grade C average to participate in school sport programs that they enjoy or any other school related activities should be changed to having a grade B average.

If you allow them to be apart of something they enjoy and care about then they shouldn't have a grade C average. Students that do what they enjoy and care about such as sports and or school activities should care enough to make the good grades for those activities. Being in those activities and sports is a privilege. Not something that is just given to you. They should care enough to make the required grades if they really wanted to play that sport or activity. Let the student know that they should have better grades in order to play the sport. It's up to them to get that grades to play the game or be in the activity. If they want to continue playing the sport or activity then they should get the grades required such as a grade B average. By telling the students that they should have a grade B average lets them know that they need to work harder to succeed. By working hard to get what they want is a great experience for the student so it teaches them to focus on whats important and be responsible for there work and what they care about. Later in life they may not have much trouble doing what needs to be done and getting it done with ease.

And if they do a test , and she/he didn't do well, they just lost their ability to do what they like. Some kids think that sports is their life, and that is the only thing that matters to them.

Another reason why you should let kids participate even though they don't have a B or higher is, that the United States is one of the country's that has they most obesity in the world. And some of the kids need that exercise to try to maintain fit. and just because they don't have the accurate grade for it, is not a good idea. So i hope you will change your mind, by the ideas that i have given you. And try to think thoroughly of the decision your about to make.

I would all the students that love doing sports to join the protest or the boycott with me and see what we can get out of it but sometimes it probably because of the money like the schools don't have enough money and they need more money because there a lot of kids going out for sports and they have Fs and but they still have the money to join the sport in there on the sports team for the whole season and they have all Fs and your coach don't know about it they are a really good player what would the coach do that's how I look at things but there not good and not going to practice they wasted there parents money then your parents would get really mad at you and sign you up for any sports anymore.

But if your really good and you make good grades you belong on the team but you can't make the practices that's showing the coach you don't want to get better and that's really bad and if you just show up for the meets or games your not going to face because you cant go to practice that's on you and your about to get kick off the team your giving up and your saying that you quite because of the coaches.

But some coaches don't care and just kick you off the team and be like bye cause your wasting my times and your time.

I would not like that because what if your whole entire school is really good at sports and there best in state for any sports and people that are the best they cant play because of there grades is what keeping them back so they would have to work on there grades and they have to ask there parents for extra help ay for more classes for they can be on the team they want and have a good season but its always school before sports because you have to make the grades and you will succeed on what your target is at school",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.2

I am a fellow student who is against you for changing the school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average.

A few reasons why is because if you did that then our school wouldn't be so fun.

Another reason is because our students wouldn't be able to develop as much team working skills or they wouldn't be in to good health.

My last reason is because it keeps kids off the streets and keeps them out of trouble.

An example of my first reason is that if I were going to school I would actually want to have an activity or sport to look forward to.

Instead of making the qualifying grade a B average it should be a C average.

Then the students would have to get mandatory tutoring to help bring up their grades.

They can go during lunch or recess so that it wont interfere with their activities or sports.

Another example for my second reason is that by being in a sport or some kind of group activity it helps us develop good team work.

It can also help out our school get more publicity for all of our good athletes and smart kids.

And finally my example for my last reason.

By being able to be in these activities it keeps kids out of trouble and off the streets.

This can help out the community a lot and hopefully change their ways or bad habits.

That way we can have better students.

All in all these are my reasons of why you should not change the school policy so that students with a B average can't be in any sports or activities.

I hope you take my views into consideration.

C163D52B6F43,"I don't agree with changing it because sometimes students cant help that they don't have a B average or higher in all their classes. Teachers are a big thing that helps you in a class or tears you down in a class. If you don't understand the teacher or don't understand the class or even don't get along with the teacher then that can change the way you work and act in the class. You could only be missing a B by 1 or 2 points and that means you cant play any sports until that is a B average and sports are important for some kids. I believe it should be determined by your homework grades, test grades, and participation grades. Sports are important to some kids and all but they have to be abill to do good in class as wail as in there chosen sport. In personal reference i am pushed to do good in school and i am unable to do sports until i bring my grades or grade to a passing average. That's one of my family's rules no sports if there is not all passing grades on report card. I personally know many students that live to play sports and come to school to play sports and they try their hardest in class but don't always achieve their goals in the classroom so that means they cant play. That's why i believe it should be averaged on homework grades, test grades, and participation grades. Other family's might think differently about it than i do but this is how i feel about being abill to play sports as long as you are doing well in all of your classes.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

I'm a student at SCHOOL_NAME I do not think the possible policy change is fair to the students and I feel strongly about that. I feel so strongly about this because I have a grade average of B. I'm also a cheerleader at your school and if my grade were to drop. then I would be kicked off the team. TEACHER_NAME I love to cheer and school is for the students to have and great education

I know but this plan to change the policy would not help nor support me/ us because many students have a grade c average.

For example with this plan I need to have at least a 2.0 to stay on the team. lets say my grades drop but I still have at least a 2.0 so I have time to get my grade up so I wont get kicked off the team. with this new possible policy I will be kicked off the team and once your off any school activities you cannot come back. like I said you I love cheering so would you take this letter under deep thought when you are deciding whether or not you should put this new possibly policy in place. CPA is what we are known for with this possible new policy we won't anymore.

I think that it is a very good idea to change the policy for athletes to have at least a B average in every subject. I think this so because it will give the students more pressure to do well in school as well as to become more responsible in life. In addition to this it well be good for the student body to know that making good grades will pay off eventually.

By having the policy change into having a B average in every class will help the students to feel the pressure into having good grades. If they have the pressure they will pay attention in class, do homework and , improve the schools as well as the students test scores. Making the students smarter and more confident.

In addition changing the policy will make the student body more responsible in life. It will teach to have responsibility to have their assignments done on time. Turn in homework when its due. Thirdly to finish class work in class. All this is very important in school.

Also this will tell they students that everything is important not just the sport or sports that him/or her may play. By pushing them to have higher grades will give them opportunity to get scholarships to go to college to play their sport and to have a backup plan if they do not become famous athletes in their life.

This is why i agree to have the policy change to have at least a B average in their classes.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4

Hello! I hope you are having an amazing day! I would just like to let you know about how I feel about this new policy to not being able to play sports with less than a B average. Some people may agree with you on this and some may not. I would like to let you know that I do think the students of our school should try harder on their school work and actually care. But I also think that we should continue to let our students play sports even if their grade is less than a B average.

To some students it may not seem like a big deal, but to others, it gets their creative thinking going. Others it is a way to relieve stress. I have many guy friends that play sports, and to get out there every once in a while a throw a football. Well they have told me that it helps get their minds off of all the stress of life, and to make them calm down. If we just suddenly get rid of that some people might have a stress overload!

You never know what struggles and challenges some of these students go through. And sometimes sports is their last resort to feeling better! Yes, I agree that if students don't try at all in school then they should not be allowed to participate in school sports. But if they're trying their hardest and a C is the best they can do then continue to let them play sports. You never know, sports may keep them out of trouble and save some students lives.

Well thank you so much for taking the time to read my letter! It really does mean a lot to me! Enjoy your day!

i agree with your suggestion of requiring at least a B average because if you do then the students will have an extra incentive to bring there grade up from a C average to at least a B or who knows even an A, also i think that you should do this because if you do then the students will bring there grades up therefore making our school seem better in academics.

firstly, our students would be studying like crazy if they knew that they had to keep there average above a

B in order to stay on there sports team, because students need to do there sports because they need physical activity and competition out side of p. e , this is there incentive for them to study more frequently student will study more frequently which will bring there grades up from classwork and tests and they will keep it up there because thy know that if it drops then they will get kicked off the basketball/baseball/vollyball or whatever they choose to participate in. according to sports illustrated 90% of schools who require a B average to stay in sports have shown an increase in there schools average. in addition to that they would be doing so well on tests that the school average would go up therefore making the schools academics and the school overall look better then the other schools and our past history of academic grades i don't know about you but this sounds like a pretty good idea to me to conclude my letter i shall say this i believe that the raising of the average for sports inside of our school would be a great idea because it not only benefits our school but it also benefits our student body in total",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent,0.4
2B53D5D29EAE,"Dear Mr. Principal

The idea of making school policy that you have to have at least a grade average of a B is a good idea, but you would have more of your star players ineligible to play because of grades. Now if our school was known for its brains and not sports, then yes i would encourage this but it's not. We are known for our sports winning state championships in all of the sports we offer. Changing the eligibility level to having at least a B or better, could possible shoot down every thing our school is known for and why people want to come to it and those who don't fear us in an athletic category. I believe though if you must make this a rule, then you have to get the ones who aren't as smart tutors or someone to help them get the grades to play their sport. For other activities the I can see where having an eligibility grade of at least a B could be a good thing like ski club, that's something that you can do by yourself bu the school provid

In conclusion I believe that it could be a good idea if our school was known for its grades but because it's just the opposite, we need to keep the eligibility level at a C average to maintain our reputation to those outside of school and those who may be thinking of coming to our school.

Well, you already know me, STUDENT_NAME, i just wanna say that even though people have low grades (in the 60's] or a C average they should still have the right to be in any sports or activity they want to be in, because they want to be part of something in the school activities. & by the way, people will try to put their grades up if they want to be in the sport they like, but if they don't even try to put their grades up to be in the sport/activity they like then why bother having them ?

Well, what i' m trying to say that the ones that should stay in which ever activity they want are the ones that really want to part of it, try to do better in class, does their work/homework everyday, participates in class everyday, & try's their BEST & not the ones that are not even trying to put their grades up, not even doing their work in class, or not bothering to do ANYTHING.

Trust me, MOSTLY everybody wants to be in a sport/activity but they cant because they have C average. You should give a chance to the people that really want to be in something to actually be in what they wanna be in ! :D

What should be a ""rule"" for every activity is that the student should:

Show their report cards or progress report anytime they get them to the person who is in charge in which activity they're in to see if they put their grades up or not.

As you may know, many students are A and B students which is above average.

But there are also some students who are average, which is a C. I think that the students may have a grade average of a C to play sports and other activities. One of my reasons is because it is average, in all schools a C is average and many students do have a C it is neither good or bad, its average. Making students not to be able to play any sports or any school activities will put a lot of pressure for students to get good grades, and some kids just cant get above average. Another reason is many students by playing sports and doing activities, it helps them to do better in life. By playing sports a student is doing something that they love, it helps them have better leadership skills, better team work, and overall just a better perspective on life.

If these kids who don't get above average grades are banned from sports and activities, they will not gain those skills that you gain when you are playing on a team, in a club or school activities. Also the students that don't have the above average grades might get encouraged by his/her family, friends, and teammates to study a little harder for a quiz, spend more time on their homework, or maybe just asking someone to help you with the things you are struggling with at school. lastly by kids getting out and playing a sport or other activities they stay healthy, make new friends, and grow closer with their families by similar interest they may have of a sport or other activities.

11D36CD1AC96,"Dear Mrs. Principal, I strongly believe that you should not put the policy of students needing to have at least a B average in order to play sports. I feel this way for a couple of different reasons. First of all, students that don't have good grades need to be able to play sports in order to keep them in school, and secondly many kids that have learning disabilities such as ADHD play sports, but can't keep their grades up.

Playing sports in school entices kids to go to school for the chance to play on the team. Many kids only go to school because they can play sports, and they know that if they stay in school and are good enough at their sport, they might get a chance to play at the collegiate level, and maybe even the professional level. Those kinds of kids don't really care too much about their grade, and playing sports makes school bearable for those kids. If they had to maintain a B average, most kids would drop out of school at the first chance they got, not try harder.

Secondly, some kids with learning disabilities love to play sports, even if they can't get good grades. Kids with ADHD or dyslexia could be very talented or just love to play sports, but wouldn't be able to if they had to keep their grades at a B. You would be robbing those kids of an opportunity to win the school respect, and an opportunity to make friends along the way.

Sure some kids would work harder in order to play, but I can almost guarantee that the majority of them wouldn't. It is much fairer the way it is now, where if you have two D's or one F, then you can't play until you bring your grades up, but it is simply unfair to expect all kids that want to play sports to maintain a B average,
