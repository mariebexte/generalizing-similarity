Why would you tell a child that they cant play their favorite sport because they have a C average. i think that shouldn't be. they would hurt the kids, feeling because he cant play what he been trying to get in for. keeping his grades up to play his sport. why would the principal do such a thing like that to kids like that, its wrong and mean.

If u change the school policy of having a grade b average that unfair. Because many students have a C average. So that means that they cant go out for sports or other activities they want to do bad.

If the school police was if you have a D average of lower they shouldn't do sports or activities.

If they have a C average and there trying hard they should be able to out for sports or activities. What if all the good people in sports have a C average in school, that means that they cant play and were going to lose every game we have. That's a good policy to get grade's up but don't take away something they care about. Everyone should be able to go out for sports if they want to. If the school policy happens, schools going to be boarding now, because now students cant go out for sports or other activities.

Students should not be able to participate in any sports or any other type of activity , unless they have a B average . This would help the students by encouraging them to get better grades. It will not only help them now but also in the future and it will help to boost there spirits.

My premier reason is because it will help students to want to get better grades. If I find out that we have to get a B average to stay in Robotics. I would make sure that I do all of my homework , participate in class no matter what type of mood I'm in , and also I would be sure to study to do good on my tests. My teachers always tell me "" You need to make sure you get your assignments in . One 0 can bring down your grade , a lot ."". I never really take it seriously . I know that's bad but, I have no reason too . But if I did have a reason too , for example I have to have a C . Then I would make sure I work to the best of my abilities to get that B or above.

Having good grades from middle school to high school is a great thing. no one wants to have D' s and F' s on there record . Its really not something you want . Having low grades can really affect your GPA when you get to High School. A lot of colleges have a cut off limit for your GPA , and that one little extra boost of encouragement can make you really get good grades and really do good in the future. If you have goals and aspirations in life this will help you to not only do good in school but it will help you do good in the future. You might not think this will help you now but it will .

When I study really hard, it makes me feel good when I get my test back . If I spent hours studying and I got even a B, I would be satisfied. I love to see people smile . Especially if its a good thing like passing a test. I find it so nice to get back a test and just think in my head "" Alright , I got a 100% . "" I get this accomplished feeling inside , and I would think its like that for most people. Getting good grades really brightens up a bad day sometimes. It gives you that extra boost to want to do good in life .

I think that having a cut off limit for students to participate in after school is necessary in all schools. It will give people the extra boost they need to be successful . It will help them to be the best that they can be now and in the future and also it will encourage them to get good grades and honors at school . Every little bad grade counts.

My reason why I am writing this letter is because many people want to participate in sports but they have a C's and want participate in the sports but they can't because of their grade.

FD9D16FF6710,"No more sports?

What would school be like of there weren't any sports to keep you active? I think students that can maintain a C average shows that they are at least trying , maybe not hard enough but they are trying. Hands-on activities sometimes encourage students to want to learn, having fun may also make students want to come to school. Having rules for sports grade wise, sometimes make students especially boys want to do better in school so that their able to be or play on the team. Telling students that sports activities will be band will make them not care or want to go to school. School is for learning but there is also some room for fun, sports is the fun part of school. Of course some sports may cause students to get behind on homework because of practices, but the school can set up a program after school for students that play sports. A program that will allow them to get a better understanding of their work and a start on their homework. I know students shouldn't only think about doing sports but sometimes a sport can relief you and relax you. If a student isn't doing well in a class and they need special help outside of the classroom they can also attend the after school program. This program doesn't only have to be for the students that play sports. I say that the principal should let the students that's getting a C average play a sport and attend the program and if the after school program helps improve their grade that should show how much sports can make a person want to strive and learn more. Doing sports in school can show students what they are capable of doing. Some students might want to play a sport in college, but how can they discover their good at it if they have no way of playing it or being introduced to it. Most professional athletes started their career in high-school. And they played the sport every year until they got good and comfortable enough to be able to say ""this is what i want to do with my life."" ""This is the career that will better my future.""

That idea could also change her mind. I think of sports as a motivation to be able to participate in a sport and get my work done and maintain good grades. Sports can also make students healthy and active. If the idea doesn't work the students that aren't getting a C average should be issued some tutoring classes or help from their teacher.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent
E52E535C2CE1,"Dear Mrs. Principal

I think that students should not be able to participate in sports if they have no less than a B average. I think this because some students are very gifted in sports but have very poor grades. This way by not letting students play sports without at least a B average they will be motivated to make their grades better so they can play sports. Also if the students with less than B averages drop out of a certain sport then that makes room for more players who have always wanted to play that sport, whatever that sport may be. Another reason I support having a B average or above to play sports is the students with less than B averages will drop out and give other players that are already on the team more playing time. Finally I think you should not let players with less than B averages play sports because maybe if they stop playing sports for a while they could focus on homework or studying for a test.

I realize that you are considering changing the school policy so that student cannot participate in sports or other activities unless they have a grade B average. And kids with C averages shouldn't be able to play sports or other curricular activities unless they get there grades up. I want to let you know that I fully agree with this thought. I do believe that grades should be the main priority, and other activities should fall in second. If you let C average students participate in unnecessary events, there grades would drop even more because there to focused on those activities and not enough on their school work. So all of those C average students would be future D or F average students. This wouldn't be a good look for our school.

There is also a bright side to this policy believe it or not. Some students actually enjoy and have a strong love for sports and extra activities. If C average students realized they could not be involved with these activities, they would want to do something about it. This would make strive harder to get there grades up. So your C average students would become B or even A average students. This would increase the passing rate of our school statics and make SCHOOL_NAME look very good.

C32CE391DC3A,"We should allow students with C averages to participate in other activities. Studies show that students that do extra activities do better in school. Researchers have 3 reasons why kids should do extra activities. They are, one the kids feel welcomed and a part of something, two it keeps the students from doing other things that might get them into trouble and lastly it is a fun experience for kids.

i hope these reasons speak for themselves so to speak. All the kids with C averages are just hopping that you will not approve of such a cruel policy.

Don't you want to go somewhere where you feel safe and welcomed? I know many people would. It is the same for kids, they want to feel like they are a part of something and don't want to feel left out. They want to explore new things and feel good about it and if you but a restraint on that then you are causing a huge problems for us growing kids. We need to find what we are good at and what we want to do in life and if you but a halt on that because of a average then you are basically taking away our childhood. Which person wants to do that? Studies in the local newspaper show that kids grades 6 through 12 do 20 percent better if they participate in sports teams or clubs. Now wouldn't that look good on our test scores? I hope you look at this in a different view.

Many kids now a days are getting more and more involved in drugs and the street. Doesn't that scare you. Think about it, kids in grades as low as sixth are doing and selling drugs for money. Police say that if we can keep kids off the streets more often then there will be less and less drug dealing kids in the US.

Doesn't that make you feel good if you can crack down on drugs and kids. It is said that kids with bad lives and grades who can't do things turn to drugs as an escape plan. So if we cam stop this our kids will be better off. I hope you can see that we shouldn't limit kids because of their grades.

Every kid just wants to have fun and just hang out with friends right? So if we can help them do that then why not do it. If we can give kids a safe fun environment to hang out in then they will obviously do better in school. Every kid just want to be accepted and not be judged, so if we can help stop that then we should do it to the best of our ability. Enjoyment is the main reason for life so why take it away from our youth. Jefferson said we have 3 reasons for life Life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Now who want to go against one of the Founding Fathers? I know not to many people want to tray that one. So lets not punish our kids for their grades by not putting them on sports teams. Do it for the kids please.

I have stated what i wanted to say and now it is up to you. As a principal do you want to be know as a struck up one or as a caring thoughtful. You pick.

Second, To some kids sports is their life and that's all they got and they much rather be playing sports then on the street corner selling drugs, gang banging, getting into trouble, or maybe they jus don't wannabe sitting at home being lazy.

EB5A7CAAFFC6,"Dear Principal,

I am writing to you on behalf of all students with a grade C average who would like to play sports. I think a grade C average shows that you can do better but you just choose not to because you ""don't see the purpose"". If students with a grade C average were given the opportunity to play sports this would be the boost they need to get and keep their grades at a B average or higher . When you play a sport you come to love it, it becomes a part of your life The sport is your life! That student knows that if they FALL BEHIND in school then they will get LEFT BEHIND in sports. I think you will see a huge improvement in the grades of your students.

I also think that sports are a way to get parents involved in their child's or children's school life. when a child plays a sport they want the parents to come to come to their games. When the parent sees their child in action they feel proud. This will motivate the parent to help their child with their school work so that the child can continue to play their sport.

Sports are not only good in school but they help outside of school also. They (they being sports) are a release for troubled children. They are a safe activity after school. They are some children's only chance at college. Sports will change a child's life. I know that you would love to be a part of that change.

I disagree with you, that students should need to have a B average to play sports.

The reasons I disagree with you are because a B is above average and students should only have to maintain a average grade to play sports.( C )

By increasing the grade average you have to get to participate in sports you might not have realized that some of your best players might have a C average so with poor sports teams it will decrease kids motivation to play.

You might also not have realized that this will make the students in the school less excited to come knowing that they are not going to be able to play sports because they don't have the capability to maintain a B average.

If the students come to the realization that they can not get a B average they are probably more likely to engage in juvenal activity, such as vandalism and drugs.

If you decide to change the mandatory grade average to play sports then you will be cutting off the people who cant get those grades to their friends which could possibly result in depression, that in the long term could result in suicide.

If you feel as strongly about children's safety and life as a teenager as I do you would not make this grade average change.

085AF5011C2E,"Dear principal, i believe that changing the policy to requiring student at least to have a B average to play sports would be wrong for many reasons. One of the many reasons would be that many students are GREAT at playing sports and they are not as good in two or three subjects, so they wouldn't be able to play. I also think that if people really wanted to play they should keep their grades up, but most don't.

For Example, say that we are in the championship game in football and are star quarterback couldn't play because he failed his science test, which means we would have to put are second string quarterback in. We would lose it and it would be great for our school to win a game for a change. Do you really think that it would improve are scores? I don't think so because then all of the boys off the football team or any other team this would happen to will quit then we will have to play second string the hole time, so really it wouldn't help. It might to some people but if you ask me it wouldn't change a thing.

They may have problems that you can't solve that will ultimately effect their grade.

I am completely parallel to your idea of changing the school policy, which argues that students must have at least a B average to participate in activities. This idea will help students to become ambitious, responsible, and less likely to take things for granted.

While extra curricular activities are important, academics play a large role in the grand scheme of things. Most often, pupils seem to become comfortable with the idea that they can slack off in class as long as they are the star if a sports team. As much as sports are important, academics are what carry you through high school, college, a first job, and so on. Though a majority may not think of this, math and writing are used multitudes of time every day. Between getting morning coffee and emailing friends, these subjects play a vital role in each and every life of the student body. Succeeding in academics may be important, but motivation is needed to achieve such a thing.

School activities are most often taken for granted. Speaking from personal experience, the idea of not being able to participate in sports or extra curricular activities is a foreign concept. Though most may not be familiar with the idea of earning the right to be on school teams and such, it will be a wake up call.

Most students these days think that achieving above average grades is overrated, or do not think to attempt doing well at all. Sports and activities, on the other hand, are something people who are not as academically inclined usually prosper in. Having to earn good grades to enjoy these activities will motivate pupils to try their best.

In conclusion, sports and activities come second to education. Though participation in these activities are fun, academics are what get people through life. With the motivation to achieve academics, a pupil earns the right to join in sports teams and such. Forcing students to attain a B average will force students to come face to face with these truths.

Do you know that many students at this school have an average grade of a C?

Many of these such students are athletes at this school, and some of them participate in other extra-curricular activities as well.

I support the policy change of requiring students to have at least an average grade of a B in order to play sports or participate in other activities because the purpose of school is to learn and be successful, time spent doing extra activities should be spent on work if they are not receiving good grades, and being able to participate in sports and other activities should be a reward for getting good grades.

To begin with, the whole point of going to school is to learn and get good grades so that you can be successful later in life.

If students are not focusing on their work and only on sports and other extra activities, then they are defeating the purpose of school.

Students who have a grade average of a C should focus more on learning in school before they worry about playing sports or joining other clubs at the school.

If the policy was changed so that students could only participate in sports or other activities if they had a grade average of a B or higher, then you would insure that they were coming to school and learning and staying on track to becoming successful later in their lives, not just coming to school to play sports or participate in extra-curricular activities.

In addition, if students have an average grade of a C and are playing sports or are partaking in other extra activities, then they should use the time they spend doing these to complete their homework, study, or finish other work in order to increase their grade.

Students who have a grade average of a B or higher can spend time doing other activities because they are keeping up on their work and studying, they earn the right to participate in other undertakings.

Last but not least, changing the policy of having to have a grade average of a B rather than a C would make playing sports or joining other activities a reward for hard work and good grades.

Being able to participate in extra-curricular activities should be an accomplishment that students have to work hard for.

They should not be allowed to blow off school and their grades and still have the chance to play sports or other activities.

In conclusion, changing the policy to participate in sports and other activities to having an average grade of a B instead of a C should be done.

This would require students to have to focus on the purpose of school, learning, before anything else.

Also, if students have a grade of a C, then they should have to spend the time they would use for sports or other activities to raise their grade.

Finally, being able to participate in sports and other activities should be a reward for working hard and receiving good grades.

As you can see, this is a policy change that should be made, as the opportunity to play sports and partake in other extra-curricular activities should be earned, not given.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent

I think people with a b average should be able to play sports because there grade is a little above average. I think people with a c average should be able to play sports just like people who have a b. People with a b average should be able to play sports because they do they school work, they do there homework, and they keep there grades up. People with a c average should be able to play they do there work but they can do better to improve there work. Students who have a c or above average should play sports. The students with a b average can help kids keep there grade so the other kids can play sport too. I think people who have a c or a b average can play sports the work hard to keep up there grades so they can help the team win.

If I change the policy it would be people with a c or above average can play sports but students who have a d or below can't play. The students with a d or below can not play because they do not work hard to keep there grades up. The students that have a d or below think they can play sports, but do not have to do the work. The students with c or above should be able to play sports because they work hard everyday to keep there grade up. The people who work think I have to do my work before I can play sports. the students with d or below just come to school to have fun and hang with friend and don't really care about school, but instead the people with c or above like to come to school and like to learn about different things.

In the conclusion, if I was the principal I would change the policy to where kid who want to learn and like coming to school should be able to play sports. The kid who want be a student before and athletic should play. The students with d or below should try to focus more on school work than thinking about playing sports. The students who don't try really don't care they just want to play sports because they are good at it and they care about there grades.

I have just heard that you wanted to change the policy where now you have to have a B to play sports. I think that this is very wrong to do. I believe in the ""No pass, no play"", which means that you should be able to make a C and still play sports. In fact, by making this change you could very well sideline some of your best players because they make a C. I understand that your grades mean everything, but it is not right to make players sit the bench because they don't make A' s or B' s. I believe that some people, even though they don't make good grades, are meant to earn a college scholarship to play football, basketball, baseball, softball, volleyball, soccer, or even run track. I believe you should consider letting C' s slide.

I don't think this is totally right. If you do this, you might not could even field a team, which is very bad. We have a pretty good athletic program, which could drastically change very quickly if you change the policy. Thank you for your time.

I think this is a good idea because it will get kids to do better in school so that they can play the sport they want to play in. But you need to have some changes i this. number one you need to give 2 warnings to the kids before you tell them that they cannot play in that sport. Number two when they cant play you need to mail home a letter to there parents. Also send a report card so that they can see what you son/daughter my what they might be missing so they can get it done. But if they don't get it done they will have lunch in the teachers room in till they get it done.

I think that this new policy requiring a student to have at least a B average in order to participate in sports or other activities is very unfair. I think this is unfair because some kids can't get a B average because they aren't the greatest at school, but they're really good at sports and it's a relaxing time for them instead of being stressed out by school. I think if you're still going to go through with this, you should at least make it so that the student has to have a C average, because most kids have a C average and love to play sports. Also, this could offend some kids and they could think that they're not smart or something because they can't play a sport that their friends are playing. Or, they could feel left out, or loose some friends, because sports are very social and many people make new friends by playing sports and doing other activities. Sports and other activities can also determine their career for their life in the future. For example, if someone plays hockey now, it could mean that they want to be a professional hockey player. Or if someone is acting in the school play now, they could want to be an actor or actress when they grow up. At our school they do OTHER_NAME and if someone sings in that they could want to be a singer when they grow up. I think that if someone wants to do something, that their grades shouldn't hold them back from doing that. In conclusion, I think that this policy is very unfair, and I think that if someone wants to play a certain sport or sing or dance, that their grades shouldn't hold them back from doing what they want to do.

I disagree, i think we should be able to have a D or a C while playing sports because a D in the school is said to be a passing grade and you would be able to move into the next grade the next year, so in other words it wouldn't be fair if you wouldn't let us play sports with a D or C because its a passing grade. Also when people play sports its hard on them sometimes to keep work up so they get work in late sometimes which may make their grade an C or D which that would mean they couldn't play the sport anymore because they didn't turn in work on time. When they want to play basketball or any other sport and cant because they have a C or D that makes it so they cant play i don't think that would encourage them more to keep their grades up. To some students its hard keeping up a grade c average but now you want them to keep a B average so they wont even be in sports and that means that people could get even more obese than you want them. Telling people they need to have a B or higher average is going to make them not want to play or cant play and the school is going to loose money because we have to pay for sports. If you did this a lot of people might want to move to another school so they don't have to have B average and there goes even more money out the door because you made it so we have to have a B average. If you would change it then you might as well just give up sports altogether because most kids cant keep a B average in school. When and if you do this the school kids wont be happy and just throw their grades down the drain anyways. If you did this then new kids wouldn't want to go to this school and they wouldn't even try going here.

To be honest that's not very fare to the kids that have c' s. I believe that if you have a 75 and higher you should be able to play any peculiar sport you want.

They have a mid class grade. Now 74 and under you know should not be allowed to play because you need to focus more on your schoolwork than any other sports.

Kids That Have A' s And B' s have the right to play ,but I think you should let kids with a high C such as 75 and up play as well and if it goes down then no you may not play. Your grades and education are very important in your life besides your friends an d family. You should be focused on them more than anything else besides your family cause family is important to.

I don't mean to be rude or anything like that but I would have to say i am against you only letting kids that have up to a B play sports.

I am against it because there are so many kids that like to play sports but have grades under a B.

Kids in school like to play sports because they enjoy it and they have fun.

There are kids in school that would like to play sports but they have really bad grades.

You should let them play because maybe after school when the get home they don't do anything.

Just sit and watch TV, eat, and sleep.

They are not exercising their bodies.

They need to be healthy in order to have a good life.

you should also let them because can stay in after school sports instead of going out to the streets and do bad things that can really hurt them and other people.

They can stay after school having fun and they are still going to stay with their friends who also join sports.

Sometimes kids are going through really though times at home maybe.

And their grades keep on dropping down because at home they cant concentrate.

Majority of kids like to play sports but they have really bad grades.

We want you to let kids play the sports they want without teachers having to ask them what their grades are.

They will feel bad if teachers tell them they cant be on the team because they have bad grades.

And they can only get in if they bust up their grades.

We need kids to exercise so they wont be over weight and it wont cause them any health problems now or when they grow up to be healthy adults.

Have you ever thought about it that way before?

first, many students think about getting out of school so they think about what they will do after, some students will text, watch tv,or what they would do a sport they love that makes them feel open and free and not have to worry about any of the small things that get to them like school,drama,and problems at home. i think ever students should be able to have the opportunely to be free and open in ever little thing they do wirthery they have a B average to.

many kids that i see make great averment's in there sports. they sportsman ship awards,fca awards they can get chiocoin to be the team captain those things change people in many ways so they could be like i am not doing so hot in school maybe i should care more about my school work and my sports.

many students that i seee have get talnet in vereything they do i dot think that she school should be able in anyway to do that because if that was the case most all the students at my school wouldn't be in the sport. alot of talnet was natural and comes naturely so the school admester will never evre have the otherity to take that away from anyone.

Some student are determined to do the best and sometimes there best is a C.

So i decided to help him in math.

The second semester he got a C+ in math. To me that is a big leap he went from a F to a C+.

I fell that he made he did the best he could and found the rode of succeed. He loves to play basketball and would be crushed in he would have to have a B in order to play.

In his min he will be heart broken and feel that his goal was not worth it and not do so good on his report card the third time around. He will be dismayed with his work and grade will drop in the school

I am part of the on the school basketball team as you know and some kid have been kicked on the team for grade and have brought their grade up to C+

Since I was very little I have been participating in all of the sports i could find the time for. Since I was little my parents have also taught me that school work comes before sports.

And last and in this case least, the people who do not try and therefore do not understand. I am the second type of person at this school. I am one who may try my hardest and simply nothing will click. No light bulbs. Nothing.

I would like to ask you if it would be in your power and will to organize an after school study group that could be run by the teachers in the school. This study group could be held for an hour after school. The teachers who attend could help the students individually in the areas that are mostly needed. This study group would be optional for the kids who want to learn. I personally have been trying to get a tutor, but these days tutors charge too much for too short of time. I know that this may be a lot to ask of you and the rest of the teachers, but I have no doubt in my mind that this study group may help the students with averages lower than a B and might just save the sports teams at our school.

From the deepest of my heart I would like you to take this into consideration. The study hall could serve as a place for kids to have the option of being on the sports teams, and the kids who choose not to attend probably in the first place should not have tried out for sports and are not serious and focused in that aspect of life.

D37E97BD69F4,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I truly agree with your idea to change the school policy of not allowing students with a C Average or lower to participate in sports. I think that this would greatly improve our schools grades because many of the students whom enjoy playing sports but have low grades will be encouraged and determined to bring their grades up so they can play. Also, they would use the same stamina they had for sports and put it towards their grades, and once they pull that grade up from a C or D to a B or an A they'll see how easy it was to get a good grade, that they'll just keep up the hard work. Which would in the end not only raise their average, but the school's as well, because we as students represent the school, and having a school full of jock's that don't have good grades, doesn't reflect well on the school as a whole.

Also, I believe that being allowed to play sports is a reward. I think students should earn the right to play on the schools sport teams, because then that way they'll learn what it feels like to earn something that they truly care for. Having the students earn the right to play on the sports team is also very important because not only would they learn how to value it, because many people take for granted what they have. They'll also learn how the real world is because you don't always get everything handed to you in a silver platter.

Another thing would be that it wouldn't be considered fair to other students how have A' s and B' s to be working very hard to maintain their grades, while students with C' s, D' s, and F' s without a care in the world are playing sports, and being the MVP, and All-Star player of the school's sports teams. And players who have smarts, and are good at playing always have a better advantage, because those are the students that get picked to play on big college teams.

The students also need to learn that there should be a balance of both academics, and sports, because you might be really good at sports but that isn't going to get you very far. You need to have a proper and good education if you want to make it big, because not all football players become famous, and if they do, it usually doesn't last too long. This is gravely important because many students now a days don't care about academic success, they think that by becoming a professional baseball player, or football player, that their life will be perfect, and that's why they stop trying in school, and by changing the policy more students will become more encouraged, and improve their grades.

I agree very much with your decision to only allow students with a B average of higher play sports. If students must have higher grades they will try harder in class, be proud of themselves, and help increase the school's grade average.

This policy would be beneficial to students who love sports but do not care as much about their grades. These students would know have to have high grades in order to do something they love. If students who have higher grades are playing, then we may have a better chance of winning, because smarter people think faster.

I believe that the better our sports team's grades are the better they will feel about themselves. Sometimes the only thing that keeps a losing team going is that they are proud of themselves. The teams that win are full of pride before, during and after the games. If we make our players increase their average they will be proud and they will have to keep that average to be able to play a sport they love.

If we make our players increase their averages, this will reflect well on the school. When the school board looks at the average of the grades at our school our average would increase because extra curricular activities require higher grades. If we had a higher grade average our school would be looked at as a better school, we might get awards, and we would be a generally better school. If the school were to get awards, this accomplishment would improve school wide morale.

I believe that making students have a grade B average or higher to participate in extra curricular activities is a good idea because it increases the school grade average, make the students try more in class, and the students become proud of themselves for their grades. When we look at all the good this policy will do, we know it is the best idea for the school.

7480BDC7C131,I think that it isn't right to change the school policy because some students cant pull there grade up to a B or higher. i think that it should stay the way it is because a C is still a passing grade and its hard to focus on 2 things at once because there is always homework that you have to do or a test that you have to study for and you have to practice for a game that's coming up or you have to go to practice so that means you wont have that much time to finish your homework or study for the next test that's coming up and you cant finish your notebook for the notebook check that's coming up so its hard to focus on 2 things at once. so if you just keep it the way it is then it will be less stressful for the students and they will have less things to worry about. I think that it will be reasonable if you don't let students play sports if they have a F or a D because that isn't a passing grade so they wont have 2 things to worry about at once because they will only be focusing on school only. this is my opinion and i hope other students have the same opinion because it will be easier for most kids in this school thanks for reading this i hope you really think about it.,2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent
A92B9B2B7418,"Dear Principal,

If you were to change policies regarding participation in sports many students might not be able to play anymore. Numerous students enjoy playing sports for their school's teams. It is easy to maintain a C average and still play sports, that is what many students are doing now. I am sure that you and I would both want our students to play in our extra curricular activities. If you were to change the minimum grade average to a B that could lead to drug use to occupy their usual practice and game time, less scholarships for sports from our school, and fewer members from our school participating in sports and other activities.

My first reason of supporting no change in the grade average for sports is that without sports students may fall behind even more than they already are and go to drugs for something to do. If their practice and game time is not filled their last resort is going to be drugs and alcohol. This would not be good for our school and we want to keep our students as safe and healthy as we can, wouldn't you agree? Our students love playing these sports and i don't think we should take it away from them and replace it with drugs and bad grades.

Likewise, If our students who couldn't get the B average are out of sports, they won't be able to go to the college they deserve. Their skills would be hidden and colleges wouldn't give them a chance. Many students are given the opportunities of a life time because of the skills that they have in their sports and activities. Parents are also helped when their children play sports because they could get some sort of scholarship and that would help the family financially. If our students don't get into the good colleges, the colleges will see our school as a whole would as not so good and give students from other schools a better chance. Our school's won't get as good rates from colleges. Our reputation as a whole would be out into jeopardy.

In addition to drugs and less scholarships many students would be out off the team because of their grades. Our school's sports team will be beat, and we will be seen as the ""weak team- that anyone can beat"". For example there could be a student who is absolutely magnificent at football and he is the only star quarterback, but he can't keep a solid B average so he is kicked off the team and than we don't have a quarterback. I don't think you or I would want that for our school. I wouldn't want our school to be looked down upon like that.

In conclusion I think that the minimum grade average to be able to participate in sports should stay at a grade C average and not change to a B average. I think is should stay the same because students may be pulled into drugs easier, there will be less sports related scholarships from our school, and our sports teams will fall behind. We shouldn't pressure our students like this, because it isn't fair to them.

Should the principal takeaway sports for people who have a C average? I think that you should only take sports away for kids with a D average. You should give the kids who are passing school the ones with the privileges. Kids with C' s could be trying really hard to pass and maybe that's the best they can do. i believe that kids who are passing school should get do to do things that they enjoy because they work hard at school and should get some kind of reward. I think kids with a D average need to try and work harder for what they want.

Although all kids do enjoy sports i think kids at school should have a passing grade to participate in after school activities. For example if a child has a an A-B average those children should be able to have there choice first, then the kids with C average could see what sports are left and pick.

Even though all kids should get do to sports its a matter of ho is can do sports and juggle a sort. There are some kids who cant handle school so i dint think that if they cant handle school they cant handle school and a sport. to be on a sports tem]am you have to be able pass school as well.

So as you can see i think that in order for the principal to take away sports she should only take sports away from the kids who are not doing homework and passing school, and the kids who are doing good in school should get the first pick of what sports that they want.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent

I'm going to tell you two reason why I think it's not fair for students that only have a B average to play sports. My reasons are most kids have a C average and teachers won't be able to do anything in their spare time.

My example is most kids have a C average. My first supporting detail is you wont have any teams. You won't have any teams because if most kids make a C average then none of them would be able to try out.

My second supporting detail is no players. You won't have any players because they would all have made C' s and would not be allowed to try out.

My third supporting detail is you won't have any trophy's. You won't have any trophy's because if no one is allowed to try out then you won't win any games, and if you don't win any games then you won't get any trophy's to put in your display case, so none of the visitors will be able to see any because you won't have none.

My last example is teachers won't be able to do anything in their spare time.

My first supporting detail is no after school sessions. You wont have after school sessions for the teachers to occupy their time because you won't have any students on your team to stay after school. My second supporting detail is no pep rally's. You wont have any pep rally's because of no students on your teams, so the teachers won't be able to set them up in their spare time.

My last supporting detail is the teachers wont have anyone to help. They won't have anyone to help because no one would be on teams, and the teachers won't be able to help out with the students in their spare time.

In conclusion, I have told you two reasons why I think it's not fair to only have students to try out for sports based on their grades they make.

I'm going to just get straight to it; I don't think you should ban students with less than a C average from after school sports and activities. I feel quite strongly about this. My reasons are that, although I never participate in after school clubs and such, I am certain that they are very important to many of this schools C average students. For some students, I'm afraid to say, sports and activities are the only reason they have for coming to school anyways. If it weren't for sports, I believe they'd ditch school instead. Not to mention that a few who only manage a C, might just be unable to juggle school and sports... at least, not on their own. Perhaps, instead of cancelling sports for C students, they could be tutored, by teachers or fellow students. Encouraged to ask for help, instead of 'grounding' them for not. Its just in their nature not to want help. I know a few students who can't do without their after school fun and have no where to go after school hours but clubs. I know many of them, if they tried harder, could really blow us away. All we have to do is get them to try.

I think this idea could help the school and students a lot.

It would make some students mad and then make them strive to get better grades so they could get go to their after school activity.

Lots of students enjoy having after school sports and activities, and if you only allow the students with a B average or above to join a lot of students would try to get better grades.

It would give them that extra push to maybe try harder or listen better.

Then if they got better grades then they could tell their friends to try to do better too.

This plan could help the school a lot academically.

At first some students would get mad at the new rules and maybe see that only the students with the B average or higher can go.

That would make them want to be on even more.

Then if they get their grades up they would be able to go and maybe try to have their friends come along too.

If enough students grade average goes up to a B then maybe you could try to go up to an B+ or an A.

You could really start to bring up the school's grade average just by doing this.

So I think this plan could help a lot by bringing up student's grade average and letting them play sports when they have a high enough grade.

It could help student's futures and studies a lot.

5A937340D387,"Dear School Principal,

It has come to my attention that you have been considering changing policy on participating in school sports from needing a C average to needing a B average. In order to think in the best interest of the students, I firmly believe that this policy change would be an incredible mistake. I think that the school should definitely not change their policy.

First, the majority of students at our school that are participating in sports and maintain a C average are doing the absolute best that they can do. Schools always want students to do their best when learning, and I don't see why any student should ever be punished for that. By forcing them to have a B average, its almost like punishing children that cannot sustain above average grades, and that would be unfair to students.

Next, by punishing students for having a C average, the school is sending a message to them that a C, which is an entirely acceptable grade, is not okay. This may unsettle several children within the school walls and cause more trouble than its really worth. I'm sure that we can all agree that students do not want violence in school any more than the faculty does, and that encouraging violence in any way would not be a good decision.

Also, students often times make mistakes in classes and accidentally end up with a C average. Many of these children are normally A and B average students that might have had a problem with a test or forgotten to do homework once or twice. These children are among the best that this school has to offer, and it would be a shame to see them paying for a mistake that they made once, especially since they have worked so hard in the past.

Finally, if the policy is changed, then the number of participants in sports will drop drastically. Depending on who might be affected by this change, our school may not have enough players for each sport, and it would be a shame for our school to lose the chance to participate in sports competitions with other schools. For some students, playing sports helps keep them grounded and out of trouble. Without the positive influence that sports provide, those children may begin to give in to negative aspects of their life, and recruit other students along the way.

In conclusion, I believe that changing the policy on sports to requiring students to have a B average instead of a C average would be a poor decision. Not only do sports help keep students grounded, but they also help students focus on their grades because of eligibility. By changing the policy, it may force students to give up on maintaining good grades, and that is not what the school would want in the end. In keeping the students' best interests at heart, I think that the school should definitely not change their policy on participation in sports.

A Concerned Student",5,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent
D336CB3A69F1,"Dear TEACHER_NAME,

I think that you should not change the current policy, making students have at least a B average to participate in sports or other school activities.

I think this because they don't always have time to do the required homework, they could have problems keeping up in class, and it could lead to self esteem issues.

One reason is because practices for sports or for something like theater tend to be everyday and go for around 2 hours or more.

Then, the kids in the activities have to make time to do homework and study which is hard to do.

Some kids might have to stay up late to do these activities, making them really tired when they go to school the next day.

It is proven that if you did not get enough time to sleep, you get worse grades on tests and stuff than you would if you slept good the previous night.

If you get a bad grade on your test or don't do your homework, it makes it hard to keep a good grade in the class.

Then if the kid gets below a B average, he or she would get kicked of the team or club.

Keeping the level at a C average is much easier to obtain than a B average.

Also, the kid could have problems with what the class is learning but can't come in after school for extra help because the kid has to go to sports practice, play practice, etc.

If teachers hand out a lot of homework one day, the kid might not be able to finish it all making them fall behind in class, resulting in them having to give up sports until they get their grade higher which can be a hard thing to do.

Being kicked of the team could result in self esteem problems.

They might get self esteem problems because they weren't good enough to balance school and activities.

When you have a low self esteem, you tend to not do as good in school as you normally would because you think you can't do it.

Also, it could result in problems in the future.

To recap, I think that keeping the cut off at a C average instead of raising it to a B average is a good idea because than if they don't do good in a certain class, it doesn't drag them down; so it won't cause self esteem problems; and so they can catch up in certain classes when they have the time.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent

If their grade is above a C in the class after six weeks they would have the right to get out if they wanted to.

If it's getting confused on homework or not getting it done to get help before going home and plan their time to do the hard homework first and the easy last because you would have all the time you need to do the hard and then the time left over for the easy.

I strongly disagree with your idea on changing the grade average from a C average to a B average. The students who participate in sports have to work twice as hard as any other student who doesn't participate in sport activities, because they have homework, practice and games. The games take up at least two hours and if they don't finish their homework after school before the game they have to finish it after their game which could go from six o clock to eight. They also have to be there an hour early. When they get home it's late and they just want to relax because they have worked hard that day. But they have to finish their homework and if they have a project they have to work on that to. It's harder for them even more when they have a test they next day and they have a sports event the night they are going to study even more, so they have to stay up later then usual. Then they don't get a good night of sleep then they don't do good on the test because they are tired. Which means they cant participate in the sport they play because of that. I would know this because I participate in sport activities and I have to work very hard to get good grades I have to stay up late and sometimes I don't get good night rests. The next day I am really tired and I don't do as good in school as I should because of it.

It's a lot harder in school because of sports if you change the average then school will be even harder and if the athletes don't get a B average then all of there hard work in school would be for nothing. Then if the athletes got their grades up it would most likely go back down because they would be back in sports which would cause the whole process over again. They are working twice as hard and they have a C average but they would have to work even harder which would be very difficult for them.",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent

Grades and sports are big things in many of the schools today. Sports are Great, usually people will play a sport that their friends play or a sport that they are good at and have fun doing. Grades are also big in schools, they show how well and how much the students are learning. Both of these things represent the school and can help get important grants or money that helps the school .

I play sports at my school and I think they are Great! I also try and usually keep an A average in my classes. So in my situation, I think that students should have a B average or higher. If I can do it that, other students can do it. If the students are willing to work hard enough to make a good grade in class than they should be a ready, focused player or participant in the sport.

Most people deal with this through their schooling. Some kids don't have the privilege because of health problems, disabilities, or if they or their parents don't want them to. If they don't play sports, the same should be true for clubs and after/before school activities.

I have heard you were going to consider changing school policy about at least having B grade average to participate in school events. I think that would be a good decision for not only the students, but also for the school. There are many students who just participate in events but do not study at all on their school work. Personally I believe that these activities are huge distractions to the students and take up the time after school for studying. All though I do have to admit that playing sports is a good thing for if a person wants a wants a scholarship to a university but then they also need the right grades to help them maintain the scholarship. Also so basically i believe that it would be great decision if you were to stop the C students from immersing themselves in distractions.

But if you were to let the B students participate in school activities they would probably become too distracted. Which would then lead to their grades falling thus turning them from B to C students very quickly. Unless students were able to do both work and enjoy school activities, there would be no need for this new policy. And also if you were to make this an actual policy, the school would look all the more better. A school where every student gets at least a B average, what kind of parent wouldn't send their kids to the place.

I am against your reasoning on the policy change. i believe that students should be able to play sports unless they are actually failing a class or have bad behavior. majority of the students at our school have the average grade of a C or better. at this school having a C in your classes will still reward you with being on the honor ole. most students are capable of doing that too so why would you think about taking that away. playing sports also helps students maintain the grades as well.

If you think about that it makes perfect since because kids that want to be athletic and be involved will have to do that to stay be involved and participate in after school activities. by changing the policy i can almost guarantee you will be losing majority of the team or group. so in my defence i think you should just keep the rules as is you will be better off doing that. If we don't have enough people to play in a game you will have to for fit most of there games so your going to cut into the schools budget just to not even play anyways.

Thank you so much for taking your time to read this, it means very much to all of your students here at this school.

4E7BE43833F1,"I agree to the terms of all students should have at least a B average in school to attend school activities. The reason be because students who let their grades fall and focus more on sports would not appear good when applying for college, since they look back on your grades, they would most likely not allow you to attend their school. So, keeping a good grade and keep focus in sports, etc. would be good to balance things out. Also they both would look good on your applications, I personally would rather be known for someone who had good grades and being in activities as such. All students who let their grades fall though, don't make it through the school years most of the time, they either quit school because they couldn't reach the requirements or just thought they were too dumb enough to be like all the other kids in school who keep their grades up.

I personally hope that the requirements to be in sports or other activities for school should have a limit, not just let anyone do those certain things but, should allow students who are willing to keep their grades up and participate should be allowed to do those certain things they want to apply themselves to. It would lead to a good lifestyle and other things that students thought they wouldn't apply themselves to because they thought they were too dumb enough to do so, but found out other wise. The life people want to live has high expectations, kids want to grow up and have a million dollar house and car, but they cant exactly get their without having a good job, and you can't exactly get a really good job that pays much without a college degree, but to get into college you have to get your high school diploma and have a good school-wise background.

Keeping good grades, and getting to do the activities you want to do in school, is all worth wild because you will probably have a good life if you apply yourself more than someone would that doesn't keep good grades, or drops out, etc. Putting a requirement to activities which students want to do, makes students who really want to participate, set a goal to reach to do what they wanted to do in the first place. So keeping a limitation on things, and giving prizes,(like being able to do sports), would help kids do better, and not only for sports but i believe also for classrooms. Having kids reach a certain goal and if they achieve it, have a reward, like candy or something they would want, like a fun day instead of work, work and work. It would help kids better than other kids who have to keep their minds focused on work, work and work, which eventually let kids wander off and start to fail their classes.

I strongly agree with the idea that students should not be playing sports with an C average.

I know a C is passing but sports will drop our scores cause we are focusing more on sports than we are on raising our scores and that will only bring our scores down, and we wouldn't want that.

It doesn't matter if we are the best in the sport, we need to be the best in class also.

That's why our coaches and teachers should work harder in getting our students here at SCHOOL_NAME better grades that will and I hope this will let people recognize us a more intelligent school.

Our school has many intelligent students, but they just don't show it.

We have students talking back to the teacher, fighting, disobeying the school policies, and many other bad things to make our school look, and most of them students play sports.

These sport players are having problems with their grades and are doing things that they shouldn't be doing in class that's why most of them have an C average, and that's why you will see a most of our students in ISS (in school suspension), constantly in the main office, and in trouble all the time.

If you chose to go along with this choice you will truly crush many kids dreams.

If a child is failing a class I don't think anyone has the right to tell them they can not do what they truly love. If a student is failing you should give them tutoring not punish them.

My other reason, is that by us being able to take part in school active is that, if we love a have a good feel for it then we will make sure that our grades are right. That we have nothing lower then a ""C"". Willing to do all our work, and will try hard to keep our grades up just to play in the game.

In conclusion, if you would let us be able to do a sport with a see. We promise you that we will do our best to get a ""C"" and high. Because by you not letting us play then we would just let our grade's drop. That being said because we don't have nothing to keep our grade up for in you won't let us do sport's with a ""C"".",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent

I want to tell you my opinion on your suggestion about only allowing students with a grade B average or above to participate in sports and other activities. I think that its not the best idea because kids should have the freedom to do what they want and pay the consequences of wrong decisions they make. If a child is doing bad it is usually their choice and they will get a bad grade because of that, so there is no need for extra punishment. Getting bad grades might make them not get as far as they would like to in life, and that will be a wake up call for them to start trying harder in school. Not allowing a child to participate in activities will not make them realize that they need to start trying harder, it would just be an annoyance. I also think it would just make kids possibly get into more trouble out of school because they have nothing else to do after school; if they maybe aren't doing homework now they probably still wont after taking privlidges away from them. I could see why you would want to do this but i don't think it will have much affect. Also it wouldn't be fair to children with learning disabilities because sometimes they can not help it for getting a bad grade. A better idea would be maybe saying if they get academic help after school for at least half an hour, then they can go and do sports and other things the school offers. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

CAB6B814A374,"Dear Principle TEACHER_NAME,

It has come to my attention that you are thinking about making a rule to not allow students with a C or below average to be allowed to play sports or participate in after school activities .

Well, i see where you are coming from when making this rule but it is simply not right and will not work.

For kids sports are the perfect thing to let a lot of stress out. If kids are stressed out a lot they will not have the concentration to do well in school henceforth they may even do worse!

Also to not let them do after school activities is just as bad.

This will not allow students to have something to put on high school or college applications. Plus after school activities will also help relieve stress by allowing students to spend time with friends.

But most importantly since a good part of students have a C average they will not be allowed to do any sports or activities so they will all be stressed out and unable to play any sports or do any activities so the students with a B average or higher will not be allowed to participate in them either because there will not be enough people on a team.

Is that right to have the A and B students suffer also?

I know that you are just trying to make grades better so instead of this what you can do is anyone that has a C or lower average they must spend at least 2 hours per week getting tutored.

So i implore you please do not make this a school rule!

I think that the new rules are kind of bad because everyone should get there workout no matter what ! so kids can stay healthy. Also because really that's a students free time because we get to run around and just be free instead of sitting in the classroom all day long.

Instead of them rules I think they should make a better rule. So we don't have to dress for gym or something at least like that Because getting a B average can be hard to do sometimes if you don't like that pacific class or if your not good at that subject. I think if this does happen students would really be upset because almost everyone likes gym because we do a lot of fun stuff in there and everyone should get a workout so yeah.. I think having gym at school is the most important because that's the only free time we ever get while we are in school.

I hear you are considering not letting students participate in school sports or activities unless they have a grade B average. I personally do not agree with that decision. Over half the kids in this school have a C average and most of the players on any teams have a C average. Even some of the best.

The kids we have playing for are athletics teams and also other kids participating in other activities, are good at what they do. Remember we go to competitions and games and if we have all the good players kicked off the team just because their grades, then we'll have a bad team. We might not even be able to make it to regions on some of the sports we do! What will people think of SCHOOL_NAME athletic department then?

Kids need to get out and enjoy playing sports; it actually helps them do better in school with an exercised mind. Sure, some people say it's to much work trying to keep up with grades and a sport or activity but it's not. If adults can go and do a job, come home, cook dinner, and worry about kids and babies running around, then i think kid's can handle a sport and grades.

I can understand not letting kids participate in activities if there failing a class but just making a C average i don't understand that. Some kids might grow up to be famous athletes and might not need knowledge. Yes, they still need to try their best but some peoples best isn't enough to make an A or even a B. So i think we should still let those making C averages play and participate in sports and other activities, as long as their not failing any other classes.

Personally, I think that students that are athletes, should be held to a higher degree of learning than kids who are not athletes because, athletes have to be wise on and off the field or court. I think this, due to the fact that some athletes maintain a C average yet, they are great on the field due to their dedication and hard work. If they were to provide enough hard work in the classroom like on the field, they would be exceptional students.

I happen to be an athlete, and I have played every sport available so far and my grades have NOT held me from playing. I have good grades because I work in the classroom. I'm also a very good athlete. I do not have a lot of time for other activities I enjoy like, playing video games or watching television but, that does not keep from trying hard. I maintain quality grades and I have the work ethic of an athlete on, and off the field.

It is said that athletes tend to have better grades and I think that should be proven by the student-athletes here at SCHOOL_NAME and other schools across the nation. If athletes are challenged like this, they will learn to work hard and they will pick up on good qualities. And like any great leader that has these qualities, these student-athletes will have them too.

40FDE82C864D,"To the principle,

I believe that a B average requirement to participate in sports or other extra curricular activities is not a good idea. I know from personal experience that sometimes a student is unable to do better in a certain class or two. Sometimes a student turns in all of their work, tries their hardest, and pays attention during instruction and a lesson the teacher is teaching. But, even when a student is doing this, they are not able to get a higher grade than a C.

Many people have certain ailments that are not helpful when it comes to learning. For example, some students are dyslexic and some students have learning disorders. Of course, not everyone has a disorder that hinders them when they try to learn.

Often, it is unfair to blame the student with the low grade when there are other students in the class that constantly disrupt and bother and cause problems. Isn't it strange that students do all of their homework and it turns out as an A+ but, when they do their school work and finish it in class, it ends up being a low grade? Hasn't anyone suspected that it could just be the fact that they pay attention and do the work given to them but they can't achieve a higher grade because they are incapable of ignoring the annoying troublemakers surrounding them?

I do agree that with some students earning F's and D's it's because they do not complete their work and do not try to pay attention. For some of them, this is because they are being influenced by peers in a wrong fashion. Other times it's because they don't want to listen, don't want to learn, and don't want to get a good job in the future because they don't care about anything beyond ""I want to be like my friends and everyone else."" Sometimes, yes, I would have to agree that straight D and F students should not participate in extra curricular activities.

No, I would have to say, over all, that I don't think it is wise to force students who are not failing and keeping an ok grade to keep away from activities that they feel happy doing. Just because everyone wants higher school grades doesn't mean you have to inflict judgement on people you don't even know. ""You can try harder"", ""You can do a lot better than a lousy C,"" How do you know? How do you know if these students can do a whole lot better? Do you know each and every one of them? Do you know what they are all capable of? No, you don't, do you?",5,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent

Your idea of changing the school policy of students must have a C average or better to participate in sports or other activities could upset some of the students. By changing the policy to, you must have at least a B average or better to participate in sports or other activities will make some students previously eligible to now being ineligible. This change could affect some of the students view of you as a principal, and it could also anger some of the parents that has a child with a C average but really enjoys him/herself in an activity or sport.

By changing the policy and making some students ineligible, forcing them to be kicked off the team or group due to insufficient grades might affect the whole teams moral and overall performance due to lack of players or participants, this might affect the outcomes of some games/competitions.

If a team that was previously a good competitor in a league or tournament but now due to lack of players is either ineligible to participate or is no longer a strong competitor could possibly upset both parents, students, and could affect the image of the school by a sports stand point.

I am writing you this letter in protest to the new change. I calmly advise and ask that you do not change the current school policy of, a student must have at least a C average to participate in sports or other activities, to a student must have at least a B average to precipitate in such things.

C is a passing grade so students should have the opportunity to try out for sports. What good does it do to have sports in our school when many students cannot participate? Students should be able to play sports because it might actually help them in their later careers.

Students that play sports have great athletic ability. The students know what their goal is in life and want to make it happen.

We should also let them have fun and be active. You should not use this policy because then very few people will join the sports. Students also can bond and show team work in sports. If only few students join, then the team will be pretty small. many students may want to play sports ,but they are not able to because of there grade.

I must say that i will have to slightly disagree with your decision on the whole sports thing. It is nothing against your authority, but in my opinion, some people learn slower than others. So for all you know, that students best work could just possibly be ""C"" work.

One of the reasons that i protest to this idea of yours, is because kids need to get exercise just as much as we need education. Now I am not saying that physical education is more important than getting the things that will help us succeed in life. But if the kids that are not doing ""C"" average work, instead of ""B"" average work, you are basically telling them that they have no time for exercise, or no time for playing, then the child will just think that he needs to do nothing but school work and not exercise. This will eventually lead to the child being obese.

Another thing is that school should be an environment where kids like me can have a fun, safe, learning environment. I completely understand your decision but strongly disagree with it at the same time. Education is very important, but the lack of exercising and just eating is what leads to the kids in this world to diabetes, and to unhealthiness. Before you make this totally official, i believe that it's in mine and everybody's interest that you pull some kids aside and talk with them about their opinions about this decision.

Which is understandable, but I disagree completely. Sports and activities are a way for us students to escape from what's around us, perhaps a rough lifestyle. Maybe that's the only thing keeping a student going is their passion for football, basketball, art club, or chess club. Their hopes and dreams are what might be helping them out in life.

I do not agree with your idea of changing the school policy to have a B average to participate in sports. As you know right now the policy is a C average and i think that is a great grade average. I can see why you might want to change it, maybe its because kids would work harder and try to bring their grades up to a B, which would be a lot better and they would learn a lot more. But i don't think that that is a very great idea because, a lot of kids wouldn't make the team or they wouldn't get to play as much because their grades were not as high as they were suppose to be. I know some students that try really hard to get good grades but they just don't get school. So if this student was getting a C average and then he couldn't go out for sports then i think his self esteem would go down really low.

Also some kids might just be lazy and not even try out because they think it would be to much work to get a B average. If this was the case then your sports teams would start going down, your teams wouldn't be very good, and my guess would be that some students would just stop trying to get good grades because they don't see the reasons of why grades are important because he doesn't have anything to work to.

In our class there is around 30 students and about 23 of them do sports, and of that 23 my guess would be that around 10-15 of the students that do sports have a C average, so if you were to change it to a B average then these students would not be able to do sports or they would just have to start working a lot harder. I know from experience that it is hard and stressful to get an A and some of these students think that it is stressful and hard to get a C.

I am an eighth grader at SCHOOL_NAME and I'm for students to have a grade B average to participate in sports and other activities. It is un-right that students don't have to work hard to do something great or incredible. Students should show that, ""Hey, I deserve this. I worked hard and got good grades. Let me get to do this activity."" Instead of this, "" Oh, well i did my best i could and still got okay grades. I should get to do this."" That isn't right.

An example of what's good is, ""I'm in NJHS ( National Junior Honor Society) and I keep my grades above an 85, and i do my community service hours."" That sounds great, and you know what, it is. Those are the kind of students that get to stay in something like that. They are proving to people that they really want to do this. They are the students that should be in these groups, and still get to do this.

An example of a student who doesn't work for it is this. ""I'm in NJHS, i get B's and C's, and i don't do my community hours. It doesn't matter if I do bad now, I am just trying to do this."" That's just proving that you never try your best to do anything. You just try to do it, but you aren't proving it that you should be in this school group.

Another example is in sports. A lot of students like to go out for sports during the year. They make it, but most of the top players never get to play that much. That's because they are to worried about practicing the sport, and not caring about their grades. Students who do keep their grades up get to play, because they are more worried about keeping their grades up instead of practicing, because grades go first before anything does.

My final example is school clubs. I play chess twice a week with all of my friends, because it's fun and relaxing to do after a long day of school, but a lot of students like to go to chess to just hang out and not care to play. If you going to go to a school club, actually go and do what you're suppose to do, not just watch people play, but you playing against them, and winning. But the only way to do that is to keep our grades up, so if don't have a good grade in that class, you shouldn't be going to a club till you proven yourself that i achieved the grade to stay in, but just don't try, go above and beyond what you could do, and keep doing it.

So that is why school should come first, then you figure out what to do for an activities. You should always, and I mean always deal with school work first, and just say ""Okay I reached to grade I need to stay or join,"" but keep going of what you can do. Reach you're full potential, and you should be awarded for what you have done.

You have changed the policy of the school so that students can only play sports if they have a grade B average or higher. I think that you should highly recommend changing this policy back to having a grade C average to be able to play sports. I have a few reasons for this suggestion ,and I hope you see this situation from a different perspective.

First of all, our sports teams here at our school don't have that many people participating in them as it is. Most of the students that are interested in the sports have a grade C average. If you make it so they can't play we might not even have sport teams. The kids would be outraged and so would the parents.

Second of all, if we change the policy to a grade B average I think that it would cause students' grades to drop. There are students who want to play sports who are struggling as it is to get their grades to a C average. If we bump up the grade average, there will be some kids who are motivated to get better grades, but others, who are already struggling to get a grade C average, to give up. It could increase the good grades or it could diminish them. Do you want to take the chance?

Lastly, if we have no sports teams, the popularity of our school would go down. Without a sports team we would be losing kids who are athletic. Losing kids in our economy could cause the school to shut down. Students would then have to go out of their way to get to a different school. There would be no public transportation available for them, kids who walk to school would not be able to get to school because it would be too far away, and parents who take their kids to school would be using more gas. We should be trying to conserve gas, a limited resource.

In conclusion, I think that changing the policy would only worsen our school academically and in sports. Keeping things the way they are could push the athletic kids who are struggling with grades to strive to be on the team without thinking it is an impossible task. A loss of sports teams could cause school popularity to drop and threaten the closing of our school. Please consider changing the policy back to the way it was before so that we don't have to worry about what could happen. We know how our old policy works, and we know that it works well. We don't know what could happen if we change the policy. Please, don't take the risk. Th

Dear Principle,

I think that your rule about the new school policy should not be tolerated. I think that students should be able to play sports no matter what their grades are. What if the sport their playing is their only exercise. What if that is the only time to be with friends out of school. what if the sports is helping them get good grades. I will tell you why grades don't matter to play sports in this letter.

So what if the sport their playing is their only time and place for exercise. If their getting a C then they can't get that exercise. They will gain a lot of weight and get out of shape until the grades are up. And cupid U.S. is already dealing with an obesity problem; Don't make it so there is another reason for us to gain weight.

What would happen if the only time to see friends was at their sports practice or games. If one person was getting bad grades and the others were getting good grades then no one would be able to see their friends. Soon that person will be detached from his/her friends and not be able to make new ones. Would you want to have some of your students not to have friends all because of you?

What if the sport he/she is playing makes them get good grades. Then when the sport is taken away he/she will continue to get bad grades. When a student plays a sport it will keep them awake and energized. When the student can no longer play that sport they will feel tired and not be able to work as hard. Also, when a student plays a sport it is proven that they will sleep better. When students sleep better they will be more alert in school. Don't you want your students to shine?

That is why i think that grades should not matter to play sports. No one wants their child to become overweight. Everyone wants friends, and everyone wants good grades. Remember how fun it was playing sports when you were a kid. How would it feel to have that taken away if you had one C. Done take away sports!",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent

I have recently heard that you are thinking about raising the grade to a b average for athletic participation. I myself disagree with this. I would want to keep it at a c average because some students who are very good athletically don't have very good grades. How would you feel to see a star athlete sit on the bench the whole game because he never turned an assignment in or he failed a test. This in my opinion is very wrong and you should keep it as it stands at a c average.

My first reason why you should keep it to a c average is because students don't have very good grades. This goes for athletic participation, after school activities, etc. For example if they make a 75% in math class but they make b' s in Language arts, Science, and Social Studies and you sit them out for a whole to games that wouldn't be fair. I remember my sixth grade year when my mom and dad saw my report card and they said ""son, so what do you think we are going to do"". I remember not being able to go to my games, practices, friends houses, and other fun activities like that. Please don't take this away from the students who work hard at what they do in football, basketball, baseball, and other sports let em roll with a c and they can go on in life.

My last reason why they should be able to participate with a c is because we all know they work very hard in school. This includes working hard on tests, quizzes, class work, homework, etc. If I were a coach I would get onto the student and tell him to get it together if he had a c average, but I wouldn't make him sit on the bench at games or practices. If I were you I would take this into a big consideration.

To my conclusion don't take this away from a student with a c average. Let them go far in life. Let them dream. If they're stars let them shine. This is all I have to say and I hope you give it some thought, thank you.!

F6EA5E76CC32,"Many schools have grade rules. We used to have a grade above a C average. Which was not a hard grade to sustain. You could do minimum work to get the grades to keep it above a C average and if you didn't keep that grade you couldn't play sports or other scholastic activities. Many people may think change the C average to A b averaged is a bad thing but i personally think it is a good thing.

There are many ways you could look at the change in what your grade average must be to stay in your scholastic activities. One way you could look at it is there are many Positives to it. For instance school is a Place for learning not playing sports or other activities. They are extra for you on top of your schooling. And schooling must come first before anything else. By changing it to a B average the Kids that were doing the minimum amount of work they could do for the grade of a C average Now have to do more work. Which will help them through life. Many of the kids that wouldn't take school seriously they were just there to play sports and figured they didn't really have to learn they could just grow up and become a professional athlete or anything of that nature now they have to work and learn to be in the sports. As may some of the kids become professional athletes of some sort the other ones that did minimum work and may not find a job as an athlete just lost there whole schooling career will now not have a job. But by you making them learn and get good grade you gave them a Back up on there life. If the first plan doesn't work now they at least have a good education that will help them find a good place to work.

Some of the kids may say that making them have a grade of a b average is stupid and is hard to obtain. Many Kids are capable of have a grade of that if they would just try. That the problem they don't try or the would have a B average already. I honestly cant see Any Negatives for me. Yes it will be more work to obtain a B average but you a perfectly capable. It may be hard for some kids that have trouble in school. And i am sure that you would be willing to work with them and help them figure out a solution. But many of the kids that have a problem of the grade average being raised from a C to a B just don't want to work hard in school. They feel they should just be able to come to school relax hang out with friends and do minimum work to keep them on the sports team. They don't realize the disadvantages to there choices. They wouldn't have realized them till they are much older and are unable to find a job because they cant do the skills other people learned in 7th grade. But by you making them obtain a B average to do scholastic activities you made them realize school is more then just coming doing minimum work and playing sports but its learning life skills and looking out for your future .

Changing the rule from having a C average to a B average may seem like a lot of kids are not for it, but in the long run they will be thankful you did it. They will realize that you did it so the would know how to do stuff later in life then just do extra sports activities.

So don't let people tell you anything different. Changing the grade policy was the best thing you could have done for the student body of our school.      ",4,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent

I think that only children with an b average shouldn't be the only ones to participate in school activities. Because more students have a c average than a b average. Also if you only choose the ones with a b average most of them, aren't athletic so you want have any sport teams. Also we will have to forfit all the game we have and, we will all be sad. You should actually have either a vote or try outs for the sport.

If you do this then you will have a actual team for the year. You would probably have more people on the basketball team than , any other sport, because its the most liked than any other sport. I also think that everybody except people with an f average should be able to participate. Because the ones with an f average must play in class, or need extra help. This is why I don't think that only b averages get to participate in school activities.",2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent
B5083253724F,"Dear Principal,

Sports are great! You should most definitely allow students with an average below a B play them. This is because sports give you exercise, allows students to interact with each other, and gives students the chance to have a little competition in their day.

First off, sports are great for students because it gives them the exercise they need. Without exercise, students and others, tend to become more lazy. In language arts, I read this passage that said, ""If you sit down in front of the TV for more than two hours a day, it increases the chance of having heart problems."" You wouldn't want this to happen to your students would you? I don't think any principal would, it will cause many problems in the school. Therefore, since exercise is needed in a child's life, they should be able to play them even if they have an average below a B!

Not only is exercise great for kids, but children and students need to interact with each other. If you don't let students play sports because they have a low grade, you might end up ruining their social life. A recent poll says, ""90% of our voters voted that kids need to have sports in their life. Without sports, they just sit home and do nothing. They can't talk to their friends and other classmates because they are playing sports. So they get used to being alone and don't want to hang out with others"" This quote states that without sports, kids can't interact with each other, which will cause them to lose their social life! Would you want to be the blame of your students social life? I know I wouldn't. Therefore, if you do not want to ruin the students social life, let them play sports!

Not only is exercise and interaction between the students important, but it gives students the chance to have a little competition in their day. This is because, many students get very competitive over sports, so they would want to help the school get publicity. I know this because recently there was a basketball tournament at our school and nobody thought that our eighth grade boys would even win a game. This made the boys want to prove everyone else wrong because they knew they can do it, so they tried their best and actually made it to the championship! This was all over the news and got our school known statewide. Without these boys, many people wouldn't know our school. You wouldn't want this would you? I definitely wouldn't. Therefore, if you want our students to have some competition in their day, and maybe even get our school some publicity, you should let students play sports, even with low grades.

All these reasons are great, which is why you most definitely should let students play sports even if they have a low average. It gets kids their daily exercise, allows them to hang out with other students and classmates, and it will add a little competition during the school day. You wouldn't want all these good things go to waste would you? Please let students play sports with a low average, it isn't that bad! It will definitely do our school a lot of good! And you want that!

FA205817C3C5,"To the principal of SCHOOL_NAME:

As of two weeks ago, I understand that you have considered changing the policy of our academic program here at SCHOOL_NAME so that students may not participate in sports or other activities, such as clubs, unless they have at least a B average in all their classes, which is 86 percent or above. I also understand that you would like to hear the opinions of your students about the change.

Of what I have heard, student don't seem to like the change very much but parents agree with the new policy idea. But as for me, I tend to lean towards the idea of the new policy. I agree that students should have to earn the opportunity to be involved with extra curriculum. The case of most students is that they get very involved with the after school activity and they forget that it comes after school. That's why they call it ""after school activity"". Therefore, their grades begin to drop.

Students may think of this policy unfair but at the same time they are working hard to meet the goal to bring all their grades up to a B average. This policy will give our students the determination to be in sports or any other activities and they will care about their schoolwork a whole lot more than before. If all of our students have excellent marks it will also give our school a great reputation.

In conclusion, I agree with your new ideas and I hope that you follow through with them. I'm sure that if you do, you will be happy with the results.

Many students have a C average and this concerns the sports and activities they are allowed to do in school.

I think that you should still allow students with a C average to play sports and activities for a couple of reasons.

First, sports and clubs are important things in a persons life.

Second, a C average is still a normal grade average.

To begin with, sports and activities are important in a persons life.

In clubs, activities and sports you learn important skills that can later be useful in one's life.

You learn teamwork and how to work well with others.

Also, you make friends were you are not just grouped together academically but also with your interests.

Second, to have a C average is still a normal grade average.

You shouldn't have to be best in class to play sports or be in clubs.

Sports and clubs are an entirely different category were you are not judged by how smart you are but by your ability to get along with other people and do things that you enjoy.

All and all, taking away sports and activities will take away a very important experience in someone life.

You should not just be judged on how smart you are but also teamwork and friendship.

442CB680039F,"Dear School Principle,

I'm writing to you to inform you that what your trying to do is unfair. Many students don't have a B average, Or are bad test takers so their grade is lower.

For instances some students get nervous and can't think straight when taking a test. So when there teacher grades them its an F already. That's not really not fair.

Also what if a student is absent and you has three test and he/she didn't get to take them and their teacher gave them all their missing work and said. ""These must be returned in one week. What if there is like twenty papers of math book reports, an projects. You can't read like four books in one week that's impossible. A bunch of projects do? Well your not getting that turn in it takes at least three days to do a single project. Math home work? I can't do it. It will make my brain pop.

Do you see how much a teacher loads you with homework there is no way will you turn it all in. So when you tell the teacher. ""I didn't have enough time to finish it all. Your teacher may reply like this: ""Well I'm sorry a week was plenty time for you to finish."" I don't see how that's fair.

Some kids like me, use sports as an escape from you house, brothers are parents. It will be difficult to maintain a B average. You would be forcing children to spend time with there family not, and maybe they don't want to! Or for instance you have a child who need to learn teamwork and maybe is in need for some man to man or girl to girl time with he or she's friends.

Mrs. Principle don't pull this law over us sporty type of kids! We try to keep are grades up, I mean C average is still passing right? Well please don't so this to us, we can try to keep a B average but Well we have 7 classes. Don't do this to us.

211F21B81B38,If our principal was to take sports or any curricular activities away then a lot of people would be devastated. The reason being is because if you had a favorite sport/hobby then you wouldn't be able to do it because your principal took it away. I think taking away some bodies favorite thing to do is like taking a child away from his or hers parents. The reason being is because if playing football was something you really focused on and your principal took that away from you then you wouldn't be able to practice and go on to pursue your dreams as a football player. I feel like taking our activities away is unfair to everyone. I mean if you think about it that's how so many people join gangs and commit crimes. Its all because they don't have a sport or an activity to do but besides killing or shooting someone. To me you shouldn't just take away all activities because people have C as there grade point averages.,2,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent
0BA5506F91C5,"Dear Principle

I really think that it isn't fair that you are planning on canceling school sports and other activities just because of our grades being a ""C"" average. A c for a grade is actually good because its better then a D or F.I think that you should just give the students a chance to bump up their grades. Really what i feel is that you shouldn't even consider in canceling the school sports or activities because everyone isn't just the smartest person in the world. Some people just don't understand the procedures they are told to do in class. Did you every think that maybe it's your teachers who aren't teaching them correctly? Maybe their teachers aren't motivating them. Out of all the in this school you want to ruin why ruin sports and activities? Some students actually like coming to school because they have the time to practice for sports, and play in games, and be on teams. And as of the activities: It is a state law that all students MUST TAKE ART AND MUSIC. Those are activities. Activities that you can't take away.

what about dance class, Spanish, and PE? Dance is the type of class us students can just have fun in for about 30-50 minutes. It gets the work stress off of our brains.. And PE is a class where you can do nothing but play sports, games, and other fun activities for about 40minutes. And lets not forget Spanish...

Some children want to learn a different language. Knowing a different language would be good on a college application for a job hire. What imp trying to say is that we need activities and sports in school cause if we didn't have them we would be too stressed. school would be boring and hard and there would be more drop outs.",3,Grades for extracurricular activities,Independent
139E760C6DEE,"Dear Principal,

I don't think you should change the school policy so students have to have a least a grade B average. I think this because a lot of kids who do sports might have a C and not a B. Also kids who don't have a grade B average might just drop out of the sport and not fix there grade and then they wont get any exercise. Exercise is very important so kids can stay healthy and live a healthy life. So as you can see sports are very important to kids and also sports keep kids in shape and motivative and it shows them how to work as a team. Although grades are important so are kids health. Another reason why you should change the school policy because if you take out all the kids with a grade C point average then there wont be as many people playing sports or in other school activities.

2907A97CC7C4,"Dear Principal,

I understand that you are not very pleased with some of our grades and I know you probably would want us to try harder and to do better, but taking our extra activities is not going to help.

Taking our activities away could even make things worse, it could trigger some students to do even worser because of the fact they have nothing in return. For example, if students have sports or any other extra activity, then they have a reason to have a good grade. I know that most likely you want to take this decision because you want to punish some of us, and that is reasonable but instead of at least having a B average why cant you make that a C average?

In my opinion, i think you should let the students at least have a C average because it can be like a warning to them saying that not only will they be not eligible for sports but that they are also at risk of failing. Some students can't be expected to have straight A' s and B' s because some students may not be good at a specific subject. They could just be having trouble and they really want a another chance. That's why instead of not letting them join other activities you should just provide tutoring for these kids.

Tutoring would be a great help for the students that are at risk of not being eligible for activities. Not only would tutoring give them the chance of being in activities but it would also help them in actually catching up on there work. It would actually bring their grade up and maybe make the subject easier for the student.

Sports, band, choir, and all the other activities is the only thing that kids probably look forward to at school. Don't take this away from them, give them another chance and your help. Sometimes students need a break from all the school work and they rely on all these extra activities and it really shouldn't be taken away from them.

I as a student have straight A' s and B' s and even thought this is not a problem with me I know that if I was one of those students, I would hate to have band and sports taken away from me. I love band, I have been in band for almost 4 years now and I do not want this ever taken away from me. I'm sure I am not the only person that thinks this way, so take it to second thought. Think of the agony you would put these students through. Please Principal, do not do this to us. Its the only thing we have.

I believe that it would not be fair to the students that are incapable of receiving a B grade average to not be able to enjoy their school activities! why? Well because those are the classes were we all just take a brake from other subjects like math, science and other subjects that we may take! Besides we need some of these classes for example physical education in this class not only do we have fun with our friends and take brakes from learning but we also get fit and in shape and this is something that's important for your health!

Further more, there are a lot of students that are in tutoring from Monday through Friday up to 6:00 pm and now even taking our personal time to come to a program like Saturday academy! Too much learning is bad for students we all need a brake from that and when we take those special school activities is when we get to have that brake!

If she would change the requirement to a B average it would motivate those students who really want to participate in sports or other activities to get their grade higher. This is a give and take situation and right now all the students do is take and take, but don't give it their all. You have to give your hard work to get something you want in return. You give them at least a B average and you get to take sports. Changing this policy will help out the students. They might not recognize the kindness of you changing the school policy, but for now you just have find a way to get what you need out of the students since they aren't going to do it themselves. I mean we need education way more than we need sports or other activities. What we learn here, we use in everyday life and the students are blowing their chances at a successful life. This is a good plan. I can absolutely feel it. This plan will be more successful than just giving a speech about importance and how we, the students, need to keep our grades up. It's not a active way to solve this problem. By giving a speech you're still leaving it up to the students and you can tell that leaving it up to the students doesn't give off a good result. By changing the policy you're actually doing something about it. This way it'll get through to the students much clearly than a speech that'll probably make the whole student body fall asleep.

Well we should be able to play sports with a C average cause at lease we are passing still. I think that the policy should change because kids could be really good at sports and u will never know until you let them play and see. C's are passing grades to me and my family but there not that great either cause u still need to pull them up and try and get a better grade before school gets out or u will be going to summer school.

Students who have C's want really like school that much cause they cant do there favorite things. School is not just about education its about doing what you want so that you can live the life you want. If you want to have a sports job like football, soccer or basketball, your going to have to start while your young. Students who make C's are still passing but they should be able to play sports still and have a life outside of school.

They might be good at sports and the coach might want them on the team but they cant cause of a C, that's not right they should be able to play cause like i said a C is not that bad at least there passing. Students with B's might not want to play sports and then if the students with C's does then they should be able to. The students are good either way but i could see if there all ways getting into trouble then they should not be able to play.

If the students that have C's and are constantly in trouble and gets more than 3 referrals then they should not be able to play. If the are good and they stay out of trouble then why cant they play sports. They should be able to participate in whatever they want.

This is why i am arguing against this because they are staying out of trouble and still passing the classes with a C average. So you should change the policy to because kids are good at sports and your not going to give them the opportunity to do so. Then they might even bring up there grades while playing sports.
