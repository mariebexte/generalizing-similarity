72705C852528,"I think that the Face is just a oddly shaped rock, it probably just got there from sandy winds and erotion taking place on a mesa and that is what made it to be like that from, from my experience with the Bible it says there is nothing else in the universe to do harm to the earth, except for sin and satin. The Lord thy God will never but something like that in the universe to do us harm.

From th excerpt it says that at that time it was a windy mounth on Mars and from that I think that it got there from erosion, for atleast a couple hundred years it would had to be wearing away, because that huge of a rock can not possibly get worn away that fast but i guess since we found it like this a rock on Mars in the Crydonia and some how it lookes like a face, and over to the next century it would probably change and look like somthing else a new shape it would not stay like that for long. But it would be a cool conspicury to think that aliens make a cool looking rock formation of a Egyphian Pharoah known as the Face.

Also from the excerpt says that it a a butte or a mesa that got eroded away over time, and also if there was a alien life form on Mars we could see it because we have this high packed pixle camera that can take a photo of Mars and we can see them and there homes on our monitors the camera is called the Mars Global Suveryor an dby the intension of that shuddle we can see all things big or small.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.2
C06037835919,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform. Information from Nasa has led us to conclude that it was created by natural causes.

When the ""Face on Mars"" was first discovered, the picture seen was captioned, ""huge rock formation."" The discription then goes into detail about how shadows gave an illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The public made up their own minds on how this Face had formed. The ""Face on Mars"" became a pop icon and was present in many films, books, and even radio stations.

The lack of evidence of life on Mars led people to also believe that NASA was withholding information regarding aliens or other life forms. These theories can not hold true because NASA would benifit greatly on finding life on Mars. NASA's profits would begin to increase.

Pictures were later taken to confirm that there is no alien monument on Mars. The picture actually showed a Martian equivalent of a butte or mess, landforms which are common on Earth.

Based on thorough evidence and research, NASA has come to conclude that the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing but a natural landform. ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.2
DC1467C8B8C8,"Have you ever wanted to be apart of NASA or a scientist? Scientist get to explore many parts of the world, even outer space. Have you ever wanted to travel to Mars known as the, ""Red Planet?"" Mars has a long history, however some NASA scientists say that in 1967 they saw a face on Mars and some people thought that aliens created it.

Twenty-Five years ago from this date May 24, 2001 a spacecraft called Viking 1 was circling around the planet Mars taking pictures of possible landings for the sister ship named Viking 2. As the spacecraft was circling around the planet Mars, it saw something very odd which was, shadowy likeness of a human face with and enorumous head nearly two miles from the end it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region on the red planet called Cydoina. Soon scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, however this one had unsusual shadows which made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

As NASA looks at the images the caption said ""huge rock formation."" The Mars then started to reveal images of a face such as the, eyes, nose, and mouth. Mars has now became a famous planet. The planet Mars has starred in Hollwood flims, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even in a haunted grocery story checkout line.

The agurment now is weither or not the face was made by aliens and the answer is NO. In passage seven, it says, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orgional Viking photo. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landfrom. There was NO alien monument after all.

I believe if I was in the NASA or if I were a scientist I would use passage seven to back my answer up. It gives all the details about why the aliens did not make the face on the planet Mars. Even though everyone would not be satisfied with my agurement, I now have proof that it was not created by aliens.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.2
D40B940B5A4D,"Why would you think the Face was created by aliens? When photographers take pictures of Mars, you never see an alien in the photos. There may be research going on to find alien life, but so far, NASA hasn't found any. Therefore, it couldn't have been created by aliens. Scientists have credible information that shows people it is just a natural landform.

First of all, if NASA thought an alien created the Face they would already be researching it. Afterall, scientists automatically assumed that it was a Martian mesa. They are common for the area that the Face was found in. Why do research if scientists know it is only a mesa? Conspiracy theorists often try to confuse the public by saying that NASA is trying to hide Mars. This is not true, and I know this because even the people from NASA say they wish there was civilization on Mars. If NASA found civilization on Mars, they would announce it because it's exciting. No one has ever seen an alien, so if NASA released pictures they would get loads of publicity. NASA isn't going to let people lose interest in their foundation, therefore they aren't going to lie to people.

Next, we have the information that tells us the Face is just a landform. When new pictures of the Face were revealed in 1998, the truth came out. Michael Malin took pictures of Mars that were ten times sharper than the original. The new and improved photos showed everyone that the Face, in fact, was a natural landform. There wasn't any evidence that could tell us it was an alien monument.

Of course, people still weren't satisfied. Once again, Michael Malin goes back and takes photos in an even higher resolution. The new resolution helped capture the real size of the Face. After extensively studying the pictures, Jim Garvin states that it ""is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"". He goes on to say these types of landforms are common on Earth, mainly in the American West. The Face is just a regular landform.

In conclusion, that is why the Face is just a natural landform. Almost 30 years of research went by until they came to their conclusion. The Face is only a meer mesa. It was created naturally, and not by aliens. No one can argue with facts!",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.6
C4CA9F468FE0,"Many people, including nasa, believe that "" the Face"" is just a natural landform. Yes, it is odd for a landform to look like a face on a planet thet doesn't have rain fot it to erode like that. It is a very agruable topic because there is really no proof of life on Mars.

First off, the Face on mars is simply a natural landform. For all we know the face could've been there for a while but we never saw it before becasue Mars could've rotated around to that side. Also that was the first ship that NASA sent to Mars to take pictures, therefore it could be older than we think.

Secondly, the only reason it ""has"" eyes, a nose and a mouth is because of shadows and clouds. The way the light is shining upon the Face it is casting a shadow to make it appear as if it really had facial structures. It was also a cloudy time of year on Mars when the pictures were taken.

Next, Most people can agree that it is very odd for something to look like a face that isn't man-made. NASA isn't 100 percent sure that there is/ is not life on Mars. Therefore we can not make a correct statement that the Face is man-made or not.

Then, you have to take in consideration that NASA waited 18 years to go back and get more pictures. If you look closely at the pictures, the Face changed in those 18 years. It faded away naturally over the years. You can see that because you can't really see the facial structures that good anymore. If there was life on Mars they would've repaired it. If you look at the picture from 1998 at the angle the picture was taken at, it looks as if it is a mountain.

Finally, It is most likely a natural landform because it faded away never repaired. The clouds and shadows upon the Face make it appear as if it was built. There is no proof that there is or is not life on Mars. For all we know there could be aliens on Mars but NASA is not for sure that there is because they have never stepped foot on Mars. NASA has only had a rover to take pictures. Only pictures is all that NASA has.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.4
C244A7AF144B,"It is just a face. The Face on Mars is natural. This is evident because it is similar to the landforms here on Earth, and there is no sign of alien or human life.

One may argue that it is possibly a sign of alien life on Mars. They might say that the fact that it does look like a face could mean it was aliens who made it. Maybe they'd argue, ""The timing wasn't right. You can't see all the details."" At that point, they just sound ignorant, but no matter their claim, they are wrong and have no strong evidence in saying it isn't natural.

This Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. Scientists have even compared it to buttes and mesas here on Earth. An example of this comparison was by Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. He said that it reminded him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho stating, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars."" Also, Mars is known for being a very dusty and rocky planet. It would be very easy for the formations of Mars to erode together and make such a landform as this.

In addition to it just being a natural landform, there is absolutely no evidence of life near this area or anywhere else. This goes to show that it can't be man/ alien made. The NASA scientists, are using the highest quality cameras in technology today. They zoom in to 1.56 meters per pixel, allowing them to see every little detail. After doing this they found no shelter, no water, no life showing any forms of a civilization. There has never been any life, outside of maybe bacteria, found on Mars, and even if there was, NASA would quadruple their funds after that kind of discovery giving them no reason to hide it.

""Why in the world will an alien was its time making a human face when they have never even seen a human before unless one came on earth.""

43C6181016EA,"In 1976, Scientists made a discovery on Cydonia,a region on the Red Planet. NASA's Viking 1 was snapping photos of the area, looking for sites for its sister ship, Viking 2. While it began to take pictures of the region, it spotted a human-like face. Many believe it's an alien monument, many believe it's a natural landform.

It has been proven that the Face is a natural landform, but not everyone seems to agree. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equilvalent of a buttle or mesa, which are common landforms around the American West. Also, there are no scientific facts that aliens are real. Conspiracy theories lack credability. They question NASA, and conpiracy theorists believe that NASA is trying to hide something from them. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget with there was an ancient civilization on Mars. They photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. On April 5,1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times shaper than the Viking photos. There was no alien monument, only a natural landform. Finally, they gave up.

After eighteen long years of investigation, many researchers gave up on the Face. Many natural landforms disappear over time which is why scientists and researchers can no longer find it.

42EE72CB128A,"Have you ever heard of the Face on Mars? It's a landform on Mars that, from certain angles, gives the illusion that it looks like a face. Some people believe, however, that this was actually an alien creation. The Face on Mars is just a landform because it looks similar to landforms on Earth, only at certain angles does it look like a face, and high quality pictures taken of the Face show it's just a landform.

The Face on Mars is similar to landforms here on Earth. One scientist, Garvin, states, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" (12). Only at certain angles does the landform look like a face. The author of the article states, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face"" (8). High quality ppictures taken of the Face show it's just a landform.

The reasons that the Face on Mars is just another landform are that it looks like landforms on Earth, only certain angles show the Face, and high quality photos of the Face prove that fact. conspiracy theories are wrong because they don't have any facts to back up that this could be created by aliens.

625D0C5C9213,"Mars is a very interesting planet with many marvelous sites. It is even called the Red Planet thanks to its bright red hue. Also, Mars has a region called Cydonia. This region contains the popular ""Face on Mars"". The Face is believed to be an alien artifact.

In 1976, scientists discovered one of the biggest wonders in the world ... ""the Face on Mars"". This happened during one of Viking 1 missions to look for a landing site for his sister ship, Viking 2. Scientists guessed it to be another ""Martian messa"", which was common in the region of Cydonia. After unveiling the image to all people, ""to attract attention to Mars"", many people believed that it was evidence for life on the Red Planet. Some people even said that "" the Face is ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide"" but, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars"", which shows that NASA would actually benefit from an alien life form so they had no reason to hide it from the world.

There are many facts that help support the fact that there is no alien life form on Mars. For example, in 1998: the Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of the Face on Mars, which was ten times sharper than the Viking photos, that revealed the ""Face"" to actually be a natural landform. Still not all people believed, so in 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took a second look of the Face. The picture was taken by a camera in which, ""each pixel in the image spanned 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The picture taken by this camera ended up showing a ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" and not a face built by an alien civilization. In conclusion, you could still believe there to be aliens on Mars, but you would just be ignoring the facts that the scientist of NASA have presented in their photos of Mars from the years 1998 and 2001.

D75D1B857377,"The Face on Mars is a natural landform, though, some may think that it was created by aliens. NASA's research has shown otherwise. The Face was not made by aliens, but under natural circumstances. There were many high quality pictures of this landform taken and many scientist who studied them. Scientist have come to conclusion that the Face is just a natural landform that has taken a not so natural shape.

Many people still believe that the Face is some sort of acient alien monument. These conspiracy theorists think that NASA is just trying to hide the evidence of life on Mars. As said in the article ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars"" (Unmasking the Face on Mars). Believers were still skeptical so, to be sure, NASA took more pictures of the Face that were clear to the eye. With these new high resolution pictures, as Garvin said, ""you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" Basically, if there were life on Mars we would be able to see even the smallest of things through these photographs. There was nothing unusal found.

For 25 years conspiracy theorists have been questioning NASA's research. Specifically, on Mars and whether or not there is alien life on it. There have been movies and books that fanticize on the things that could possibly be living on the Red Planet. These theories are not backed up by knowledge and facts like NASA's. NASA's scientist are the best of the best when it comes to knowing abot outer space. These scientist have seen Mars, and the Face, in person. Most of the theorist have never left the planet. Lastly, there are many natural landforms like the Face on our own planet. An example of this is, Middle Butte in the Snake River PLain of Idaho as pointed out by Jim Garvin.

Outer space is the home to many mysteries bu, the fact that the Face is a clue to alien civilation isn't one. Even though the landform looks as if it could a ruin of a acient alien civilization, the facts have shown that it is not. Through studying the pictures and positioning of the Face, NASA's professionals were able to conclude that it was just a natural landform much like the ones found here on Earth.

I looked at the evidence and the photos that the scienctist gave me they showed that in 1976 the face was full of dust and etc. Which could have formed the face from probably erosion of the dust or even the illusion of the human eyes,mouth, and nose .

For Example in the article I read a passage that said ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact"" , they had no real proof of it being this .

Then another photo that I recieved from the team in 1998 showed that Face started to show as if it was unmasking itself for us to see, which had probably given NASA the thought of it being an alian artifact , but still they had no real proof of it being this .

I read a passage and it said "" And so on April 5,1998 , when Mars Global Surveyor few over Cydonia for the first time ,Miachael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos .Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the first image appeared on JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform.

As I asked a few other scientist about it I knew it would be interesting to see and search on. As we all were looking at this photo of what seems to actually be a human face on Mars a new scientist walked in and talked about it.

He began to say that ailens put it there! All I could think of is why and how would they do it. They may not even be real, we have no evidence to show that soemthing living lives up on Mars. I had began to tell him that's it's not possiable! I even gave facts about how anything livinh like humans or animals couldn't live up there. But he still thought it was true.

D2F05EF485CB,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", there is information showing that the Face is a natural landform, and was not created by aliens. I have to agree, and say that the Face is a natural landform. Reasons to back up my thought would include, that the Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped quite a few pictures showing that it wasn't a real face, they have never seen anything like this before, and more scientists believed it was a rock formation rather than an alien.

The Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped quite a few pictures to get closer looks on the formation, to see if it could be a real face or not. In paragraph 7 it stated, ""...Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" Malin and his team took sharper pictures to prove to other people that they were right about it being a natural landform. Scientists also haven't seen anything like this before. In paragraph 9 it mentioned, ""We just dont pass over the Face very often."" If it really was an alien you would see more things like this because there wouldn't be just one alien, there would way more, causing there to be more faces. More scientists also believed that the Face was a natural landform, while only a few believed it could have been an alien feature. Within paragraph 8 it stated, ""But not everyone was satisfied... Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" By the article saying this, they showed that some people disagreed with the other scientists, and actually thought it was some sort of alien marking.

Although, most of the scientists say that this is a natural landform, there will always be someone who wants to disagree with them. No matter how many people would say that something is right, there will always be that one person who has to be different then everyone else. In the article, there are more facts saying that the rock is a natural landform, even though that leading it to be bias.

Twenty five years ago we found what looked like a face on mars. We didnt know if this were something caused by aliens or just something that was natural.

Just to find out we caught the face at the right time when we took the first picture. We found out the picture was takin in winter on the planet and it was a cloudy day.

But it has to be alein life form that created this. They can easely destroy what they make. us humans do it all the time. And why would you guys at NASA put something like this out in the world for people to see? If it wasnt real life on anouther planet. Do you like playing games with us.

So we also know that there is no life on mars because we have cameras that can capture the smallest of sheds. On camera so if we saw a little house on the camera we would think there is life on this plante for sure(11). at NASA we didnt know exactly what caused that face at the time.

At that time, they didn't' really what know what it was exactly. I am here to prove you that the Face is just a natural landform.

If the Face is an alien monument, there could have been mysterious looking structures on the monument.

The 2001 image of the Face doesn't show anything phenomonal, it is just a simple landform. According to NASA, the shadows just give the landform a face. As for my last evidence, Michael Malin and his team took a sharp photo of the Face explicitly revealing that it is just a landform.

As the old photographs suggests that it is something made by the aliens, it is not. It is just a landform based on the newer photograph. A scientist claimed that the Face is either a mesa or a butte which reminded him of a butte he saw before. As it is popular within the media, no one knows what it is.

FF415EE49DB5,"When it comes to alien life forms, people on Earth have found very few signs that they exisit. With the signs we have found, our technology now a days has proved the aritifacts to be just conspiracies. One of the great conspiracies of aliens started with a picture in 1976. The picture was from a part of Mars that wasn't explored very often. Since people have been curious about aliens for years, they blew the picture out of proportion which started a chain reaction of people thinking that aliens were among us.

One of the many reason that prove this landform wasn't made by aliens is that the technology wasn't very advanced when the picture was first taken. This first picture of the Face was taken in 1976. Viking 1 was taking pictures of Mars when the camera took a very hazy and blurred picture of a really big rock. Since the technology wasn't very advanced at the time, scientists couldn't see if the rock was shaped like a face or just shadows reflecting off of the rock to make it look like a face. No one was very certain what it was.

Since no one knew exactly what the rock was, the public took the opportunity to make a really big deal about it. Back in the 70's and 80's aliens were a big deal. People wanted to believe that aliens were among us. Because the rock looked like a face, people wanted to know if the Face was made by aliens or if it was just another landform. To get the public stirring, there were movies, books, magazines, and radio talks shows about it to give consumers what they wanted, a real life alien colony.

In 2001, NASA decided to get another picture of the Face. When the picture was sent out to the public, all of the rave about the Face was snuffed out because the picture looked exactly like a landform. Scientists then closed all exploration on the Face because the picture didn't look anything like a Face. It just looked like a plain, old, boring mesa. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Program even said that it reminded him of the Middle Butte in Idaho. Since the picture was so exact, if there was any life in the picture, the scientists could've seen it in the picture.

Aliens are still being researched today, but back in 1976, the rave of the Face created by aliens was all fake. Since the picture taken in 1976 in so blurry, we can't see exactly if it's a face or not. Then when the new picture was taken in 2001, we could easily see that the Face that was made by aliens was actually just a mesa or butte. All of the publicity that the Face got was just because at the time people wanted to know if there were actually aliens out there.

8D5155860C3A,"The ""Face on Mars"" was not created by aliens. It was a natural landform that appeared through mars grounds. Most people think that the face came from an alien which is not true at all. The reason people think that is because they believe there are aliens on the other planets. But, scientist did research and found out that is was a natural landform.

The face appeared on the monitors of Jet Propulsion Lab. They figured that it was another Martian mesa. I know that the Face of Mars didn't come from an alien because it was a humans face, they said. Aliens don't have human faces, so thats how it is a natural landform. Even a few scientist thought it came from an alien , thats when Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia and snapped a few pictures to get a better look at it.

So, well thousands of sites waited for the picture to appear on JPL web site. It was revealed a natural landform, no alien monument after all. The Face of Mars was not easy to see because it wasn't really easy locating cydonia. The face shows either the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms. But there are still people who thinks otherwise so......

In conclusion, The Face of Mars wasn't created by aliens, it was a natural landform. Scientist did their research and even took pictures of the face on Cydonia. There were no evidence of aliens or UFO around the face. As of now most people will follow the truth and most people will still think that the face came from and alien.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.4
C6695C88D6AD,"According to my scientific studies done at NASA, this landform is natural. It is not made by aliens. I have done much research in my day as a scientist at NASA, and I know that plates on a surface can shift land due to forces, and that is why I do not believe this ""face"" was made by aliens.

I believe this face on Mars is natural because aliens are not real. This face on Mars just happens to look like a face. In my experienced years of being a sceintist, I know people get fired up about things that are not supposed to look like something else but they do. This is a perfect examle of just that! This face is naturally made, but because it looks like the face of an Egyptian Pharaoh, it is different. Just because it looks like something does not mean that aliens or something else that is creapy made it. This landform just happened to look like a face. That is that. There is not enough evidence to support that aliens made the Pharaoh-face landform, so for now, let us consider the face naturally made.

Overall, I believe this face is naturally made. There is no evidence that supports the fact that aliens went to Mars and made a face on the surface so the entire planet Earth could see it and become curious. On the other hand, there is more evidence to support the scientific theory; The landform is naturally made. Aliens are not real, and there is litle to no evidence to support the alien theory. Until someone comes to me and finds supporting details about aliens creating this landform, I will not change my thoughts and views on the whole situation.   ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.4
4D0233F6C1E8,"The face on Mars is a very interesting thing. It looks like a human head but there is now way it could be because it is two miles long. Some people say that is was made by aliens. NASA says that it is just a rock formation that happend naturaly. There are many arguments for both sides. I'm going to tell you the arguments from the side that says it is just a natural rock formation. This face on Mars is a natural rock formation because, if it were made by aliens than when they got close to it they would have saw things that would be unatural. Another reason is it looks like buttes and mesas that we have here in the United States. Lastly we have been studying this for twenty five years and never before has an alien came up and said, ""Hi I made this"".

The first reason why I thin that this was a natural formation is that we have gotten realy close to the formation and never have we seen any aliens or even any buildings other than the face. On April 8,2001 it was a cloudless summer dday in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, said Garvin. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. This proves how close they got to the planet and they never had anything happen to the nor did they see anything. Thust proving my first point.

Another reason this formation is natural is that there are formation in the United States that have naturlay occured. Buttes and mesas look very similar to the face on Mars. This is what NASA says about it ,what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. This shows that there are very simmilar things to the face in our world today. Thus proving my second point.

Lastly we have been studying this thing for twenty five years. NASA has been taking pictures of it for a long time now and they have not found any signs of life on Mars. Some people would say that NASA is hiding stuff. NASA would not hide stuff like this for many reasons. Here is what they say about it. The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showseven haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Marsevidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Thus proving my third point.

So in conclusion there are no signs of alien life on the planet. This is how NASA concluded there point. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. This proves that even though several people think that there is life on mars there is no life and this is a natural formation.                        ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.8
ED85FFB5DE92,"The face on Mars is just a mesa. It was not built by aliens, and I can prove it. When the face was first photographed, NASA did not have very good cameras. They were up to date but not very powerful and had bad pixles. The 1976 Viking 1 had 43 meters per pixel in the best photo.

While some people say that this is definetly alien activity, they have been proven wrong. In the 2001 photo, the great pixels showed that this was nothing more than a mesa with weird shadows. There wasn't even anything around it. There were no planes houses nothing just a big lump of rock.

This kind of mesa can be found on Earth too. There are a lot in the U.S.A. one especilly good one is a lava dome in Idaho. Even though this mesa on Mars is not lava it is a rock that looks like natural earthly structures.

Back then nobody was positive that it wasn't aliens that had built a really big sculpture, but as tecnology got better, NASA was able to say for sure that this odd thing on Mars was not aliens. Only a big mesa that was isolated on the Red Planet.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.4
0C7890BF0A4E,"This argument of the face on Mars been going on since 1976. Many people and even some scientest believe it is craftmenship of no other than aliens. Their have always been stories about how so called aliens live on the planet Mars,or how there is life on Mars. I am here to ease your mind and tell you it is no more than a mesa.

Their has been alot of talk about the rocky terrian we call Mars. First off this isn't the first case of where a face has been captured. On a nother part of the Red planet there is an area called Cydonia. Their was an image of a something that resembled an Egyptian Pharaoh. That was just a shadow giving the unusal look of the pharaoh. This proves that not everthing is what it seems.

Next after discovering that this unusal look for Mars was just a shadow creating the illusion of having a human face we were fasinated and had to indoulge ourselvs in more reaserch. On April 5, 1998 our Mars Global Surveyor had gone over Cydonia. Our magnificant team of reashers got a picture that was a wopping ten times sharper than the origional photo. We had thousands of people waiting to see what was on our Red Planet it was nothing other than... a landform.

Then after that find we couldn't stop there. We were so close and we were desperate to find the truth. So we had studdied the pictures,and yet still nothing. The face on Mars was no different than your common landform on earth. We were sure right there it was nothing more than a lava dome that has molded its form into an isolates mesa.

Now some might say that our picture we claim that is extremly crediable could be nomore than a fluke, and there could be aliens and a chance for a new civilization on Mars. Now for us we wish there was an acient civilization on Mars, but we can't hide the truth. Finally for our picture in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, and if their was any sign of life like houses,airplanes,or even Egyptian styled pyrmids you would be able to see them. This how we know our information is credable.

Now it seames the whole "" Face on Mars"" in movies, books, magazines,and radio talk shows were all false. That whole franchisement was a total bust. Now that you know the truth and the face on Mars was nothing but fraud i hope that you listen to the people down at NASA.

FD942066A558,"The landform on Mars is very similar to the mesas or platues of the North America's Southwest. The Face of Mars is indeed a natural ocurrance. It has been proven with some very expensive and accurate technology that it is not an alien artifact. It would be in NASA's interest to share it if it is an artifact. The first 1976 Viking photo is not creditable.

The credibility of the Mars Global Surveyor has been tested twice on the Face. It took its first picture of the Face in 1998. Sceptics blamed the weather for covering up ""hidden alien signs."" Three years later, the Mars Global Surveyor took another picture of the Face. This picture was taken with optimul weather conditions and on the highest resolution possible for that camera. The clearity showed that the Face of Mars was mearly an amazing landform, not an alien artifact.

If for some absurd chance it was an artifact of some ancient alien race it would have helped NASA. They could have recieved more funds to go explore and find remenants of the alien civilization. They would have told everyone. They could make a huge profit from it. NASA could get more money from investors and taxpayers. It would have been to there benifit.

The Viking 1 photo is 40 years-old. The quality of it is not near;y the same as the Mars Global Surveyor. The Face of Mars may have only been seen because of weather conditions that day. In 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture ten times sharper than the already 22 years-old. The Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture that was a lot clearer but still not good enough for some.

In conclusion, the conspiracy theorists have no reliable information. It has been proven by the MOC and the Mars Global Surveyor that it is just a landform. The 1976 picture is too old to be reliable. All it shows is a mesa with amazing shadows. NASA probably dreams it was an artifact so they could get a budget increase. All of these points lead to one obvious answer, the Face of Mars is just a mesa on Mars. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.6
0A2AEB3D89DF,"So, you want to tell me that the rock and craters on Mars are aliens? Myself belive it is not myself and fellow scientist find this to be true. Back in 1976 I got my first glipse at the figure on the surface it made me think it was alien until the Mars Rover proved it could not possibly be made by aliens.

When we first released the piture it set the world on fire as much talk about the face on Mars it made us look like we made the discovery of a life times work we all shared the cridit for finding the face. Nasa became the biggest hit around some took advantage to that some did not others did.

Allthough we proved it to be a natullary formed crater by using the Mars rover. Even after this a group of them left because they belived aliens were real and belived aliens created this monumentail artfact which would change space to how we know it to be today.

Mars did look like it had small shacks which they thought was house arfound the massive rock. Mars has a very rocky layer on its top it gives Mars the ability to have craters which from a distance look like shacks.

The one thing the told me is what I can't explain it to this day I have no respouce to it they said do you see the crocked grim on its face every time we look at this figure it has a differt face which is hard to explain.

I'll tell you what I told him though is that you can never underesitmate the force of gravity. Gravity pull masses on to that face of Mars shaping differantly every time.

As conclusion the belivers in aliens started a foundation. The foundation was called alien were here. They could not prove that they were right so they foundation had to swith to make more sense to have an resonable idea the new foundation also died off. The new foundation has The Brithish were here which everone new so they had no purpose they ended up giving up on any chance of company.

Now first of all aliens haven't been proved real yet, so if aliens aren't real then how can people say aliens did it. In the first image taken in 1976 I can understand why people are creating theories. But if you look at the one taken in 2001 you can clearly see that it is a mesa. Even in 1998, when technology was advancing, you can still see that it is a mesa or just even a type of landform.

Like Garvin says ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" and I agree with him completely. I bet if we looked now with the technology we have with could see little rocks on the ground because our country is so advanced in technology.

9F2E3072B5C6,"25 years ago, a NASA spacecraft called Viking 1 was circling Mars, taking pictures of landing sites that its sister spacecraft, Viking 2, could possibly use. While circling Mars, it snapped a photo of a landform that seemed to look similar to a human face. Thay called it the ""Face on Mars"", and it became hugely popular, making appearances in movies, books, radio talk shows, and even grocery store checkout lines in the form of magazine covers. Contrary to some popular belief, wasn't anything to do with aliens, and here's why.

The Face on Mars is what you would call the Martian equivalent of a mesa, a natural landform that is common in the American West. The scientists assumed so whenit first appeared on screen, but this particular mesa had shadows that made it look kind of like an Egyption Pharaoh. When releasing the images to the public, the author of the article made it sound like the eighth wonder of the world, trying to attract attention to Mars, and it worked.

The photographs that were first taken of the ""Face"" were very hazy, and many people believed that there were some sort of alien markings under all the fog. The truth is, they took amazing photos with maximum resolution on April 8th, 2001, and there were no markings, aircrafts, little structures, or pyramids to be seen anywhere. What the picture does show is that the ""Face"" is, in fact, a kind of butte or mesa on Mars. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Eploration program, said it reminded him of ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."".

There must have been a drgee of suprise among missions contollersback at the jet propulison lab when the face apperared on their montions.

If NASA did not want the world to know about these things they wouldnt tell us at all what's going on but they do because they want us to be interested.

FCA1AB6EFD68,"Twenty five years ago a sacecraft valled Viking 1 from NASA took a picture of what looked like a human face. Eighteen years later Mars Global Surveyor took a photo of it that was ten times larger than the last one. This photograph showed that it was nothing more than a natural land form. Some people thought that it looked this way because of clouds. Finaly in 2001 Mars Global Surveyor took a second shot at it with a much better resalution. This one also suggests that it is nothing more than a landform. Some people still think this was made by aliens despite all of the evidence going against it. I think that it is just a landform because, aliens wouldn't know what humans looked like, it isn't that unlikely, and there are other things it could be.

My first reason is that aliens would not know what humans look like. If you think about it animals on earth don't look like humans so aliens wouldn't look like that either. Mars also has really bad conditions for life like us to survive. Plus aliens woul probably look even more different than animals because they evolved on a whole other planet. It is even more unlikely that they would just guess what we look like.

Another reason is that it isn't that crazy of a coincidence. A human face is only two dots with a dot centeered under neath them and a line under it. and this doesn't even have a very distinctive nose so its just two dots and a line. Its like when you look at the clouds and see what looks like animals or other familiar things. You know aliens didn't put those there.

My last reason is that there are plenty of other things this could be. It could just be some sort of landform. Espescially in the last picture you can see lines it it resembling something that was made naturally. It is kind of like a butte or messa on earth only this is on mars. This is most likely made naturally.

The chances that this was made by aliens is incredibly low. The first picture however, does closely resemble a human's face. The problem is that with each picture it looks les and less like a human face. Also the last picture was taken on a cloudless summer day. I dont think this was built by aliens because, aliens wouldn't know what we looked like, it isn't that unlikely, and there are other explanations.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.6

Don't get me wrong I do think that it is just a normal landfrom but, if you really look at it then it actually isnt a regular landfrom. To me it looks like the shadows on mars are creeping up on the mass of rock or sand or whatever it is. Like the scientists said the creeping up shadows is what gave the landform a the eyes the mouth and the nose.

But, this face they say is actually called a mesa. From all the years it has went through such as 1976 to 2001 I would say that the face is now older and deformed. The article says what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" says Gavin. They also says it's not easy to target Cynodia.

So when people say that the face is an actual face they are wrong becaus e if they would actually read a article on the mesa/face . They would see that they are not right at all they are just wrong.

The face on Mars might look like it was created by aliens, but our reasearch shows that it is just shadows. Also because we have been doing reaserch for so long all of our studies show that there is no possible way that any creature would be able to survive on any other planet in our solar system other then Earth. Also as it said in our reserch it is just a rock formation that happened because of soemthing like a landslide.

When all of us here at Nasa first saw the image we knew we had to study it! When we beagan our studies we sent a space craft up to take pictures. When we recived those pictures we noticed that it looked like it was a shadow of the way we were taking the picture or maybe the way that rocks were laying. We were all still curious on how the rocks got there so we kept studying!

At NASA there is always reaserch of something going on! When we first started reaserch one of our main goals was to figure out if there is any possible way that people could live on any other planet then Earth. So far we have concluded that there is no possible way that anyone could survive on any other planent, because there is no suply of food or water. So with our prior knoladge of that we knew that there were no aliens on any planets!

Even though we knew all these things we still wanted to know more so we continued our reasearch. While contuning our reaserch we found out that it was highliy possible that there was something like a landslide on Mars. With our knoladge of landslides we knew that they can sometimes form things like rock scopluters that look like things they are something they are not. So with all of our reaserch we all came to a conclusion.

All of us at NASA were very sure with our conclusion of this was not created by aliens that it was just something as simple as a land slide and shadows. Throughout our reasearch we found out that the reason the rocks look like a face is shadows, and that the rocks got there from something like a landslide.

In paragraph 3 it talks about how the fce is just a natural landfor. Saying it is just a rock formation. Also it says that the shadows just give it the illoution of being a face. Which means the sun has cast shadows on the rocks and the way the rocks were formed it made the shadows fall in the wholes appering to be a face when it really isn't.

In paragraph 7 it says that there is no alien mounuments. Proving most theroy's wrong. They found this out by taking another photo with a better liense so they can soom in and see what is really there. By doing this they found no alie monuments and that it is just a land formation as NASA origonaly belived.

Also in paragraph 12 it says the face is equivilant to mesa or buttle. Which means that it is compare to mesa and buttle wich are both natural landforms on Earth. Also in this paragraph it was proven that the rocks were created by lava. So now it is considered a lava dome.

So over all scients now belive that it is just a natural landform and that there is no aliens ther and that there never was. Insted they say it is just a rock formation that was made out of lava.

Then at the year 2001 they took another picture and it was fading away and I honestly dont think that the aliens would be able to take the face down that fast and why would they have to take it down. It has to be natural because there are no suh things as aliens, because no one from nasa has ever seen one and if they would've Nasa would've told everybody that they have found aliens and that they are real.

It is a big ovle that looks like it has eyes a face and nose. The face is looking right out into outer space and it has a veiw of the whole solar system. When the NASA spacecraft called Viking 1 taking pictures of spots were its sister ship could land Viking 2 it was if the face was looking at them. There is not a face on mars, it is just a landform with a shadow that makes it look like a face.

There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. In paragraph three is says that A few days after discovering the face they set it out for all to see, and the caption noted ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, and took pictures with there Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) they revealed that there were no aliens and that it was just a landform.

In paragraph eight it says that not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at forty-one degrees norht martian latitude where it was winter in april '98 a cloudy time of year on the planet. So skeptis said that perhaps the the alien markings were hidden by the haze. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids you could tell what they are.

What the picture actually shows is the Matian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around American West. This pictures shows a face but it is just a landform with a shadow making it look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose. People think that aliens are making signs saying that this land is theres but its just a landform nothing more, nothing less. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydoria Mars Global Surveyor (MOC) drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolutuin. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

The Face on Mars has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for twenty five years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancietn civilazation on Mars. But there is no such thing as aliens, nothing can live on mars or any other planets besides earth. Some scientists think that the Face was an alien artifact, photographing \Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the red planed in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended.

21138AD07A6A,"Imagine it's 1976 and Nasa reveals an interesting photo looking down upon Martian landscape. The photo catches your eye as it contains what apears to be a giaint face made of rock coming out of the sand. Nasa states that the ""face"" is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. But you also hear other people saying that the face is an ancient alien artifact! What do you believe? Pop culture quickly jumps on the idea of aliens because that view point is exciting. Meanwhile NASA is a government backed and very credible source. I say that the educated person would listeto NASA. I believe that the ""face on Mars"" is just another natural landform becasue the face looks just like a butte or mesa does on Earth, NASA's powerful cameras haven't captured anything alien looking on near the face, and becasue the majority of NASA and other creidble scientists don't believe that the face is alien.

According to the article Martian mesas are common around Cydonia, the area where the famous picture of the face was taken. There is nothinig unusal or different about this specific mesa exept the shadows on top of it. These shadows give the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Mesas and buttes are landforms that are also very common on Earth around the American West. The Middle Butte in Idaho is a an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. I'm sure if pyramids started being discovered on the surface of mars thats one thing, but just a single mesa that looks a bit like a face is no reason to immediatly blame aliens.

Another reason why the face is just a natural landform is because we have seen proof that is nothing but a landform.. On April 8, 2001 which was a cloudless day in Cydonia, another picture of the face was taken with a very powerful camera that used its maximum resolution for the picture. When you look at this picture it is almost hard to immgine a face even being there! The illusion of a nose, eyes, and a mouth is gone. All that remains in this picture are some cracks and rough edges on the rock structure. To many seeing is believing and this picture has allowed many to see the truth that the ""face on mars"" is nothing but a myth.

Some suporters of the idea that the structure was created by aliens argue that NASA is hiding more evidence and mabey even distorting images that point to the face being built by aliens. This is wrong because alien civilizations would increase NASA's funds and popularity. Also it would be almost immpossible to keep an alien secret from the public with so many immployees knowing. These examples show why the ""face on mars"" is just another natural land formation.",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.8
ECF5C58B95A3,"Is it possible that the face on Mars could have been created by aliens? Some people believe that the Face on Mars was formed by aliens; however,

I do not believe that is possible. A few of the pictures taken of the Face on Mars were taken when it was cloudy,but that is the only information that suggests that aliens could have made the face. Many scientists have done extensive research on the Face on Mars, and they have found that it is nothing more than a natural landform in the shape of a face. If you believe aliens formed the face on Mars, then be prepared for multiple facts that go against that belief.

Numerous scientists have studied the area in which the surreal face formation is located, and they have found various mesas. Martian mesas are common around Cydonia, the place in which you would find the face. Because of these facts, it is believed that the Face on Mars is just another Martian mesa that is coincidently shaped like a face. NASA even captioned one of the pictures saying ""Huge rock formation that was formed by shadows, giving the illusion of a face."" This explanation makes a tremendous amount of sense more than aliens creating the face.

Although quite a few people vehemetley express their opinions that the face is evidence of life on Mars, NASA says that they are not hiding any information about alien life. Why would NASA keep life on Mars a secret? If life was found on Mars, NASA would share the information because they would make a lot of money from it. They would make history if they had proof of life in Mars! Some defenders of NASA even wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. There is absolutely no way that NASA would turn down that amazing oppurtunity and keep the evidence to themselves.

The picture taken by Michael Malin is another reason to believe that the face was not an alien creation. He took a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos by using his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC). The picture taken on April 5, 1998, revealed that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. There was no reason to believe that the face was not natural, but some people still believed that aliensdid in fact make the formation. The tenacious scientists were still determined to find evidence to make everyone see the truth.

April 8, 2001, was a cloudless day in Cydonia, and Mars Global Surveyor was able to get close enough to the face to capture a extraordinary photo.

The picture was taken using the camera's maximum resolution. If there were objects in the picture near the face, you could have seen what the objects were. There was nothing unusual aroung the Face on Mars.

The picture shows a Martion equivalent to landforms common around the American West. It reminds some people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is the same height as the Face on Mars. This evidence supports the idea that the giant, face-shaped formation is a natural landform, nothing more, nothing less. Aliens are not even proved to exist, let alone form a landform like this one.              ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.8

In 1998 it was in the winter for the planet was so it change the outlook on the butte. 2001 was the best by far it was during the summer and it was the most recent one taken

Second in 1976 the camera was even close as it is now.

In 1998 the camera made a big step and made the image have the best resolution having a stuning 1.56 meter compared to the 43 meters in 1976 they only problem it was in winter and it was really hazy. So in 2001 they took another image it was not even close to ether of the photos in 1976 or 1998

The rock maybe have laded and make or had a face shape from the way it landed. Im not so sure if it had landed like that to make a face shape.

The face has been fading, There is no real proof of the face being kept there by aliens, and there was no alien momunment after all.

One reason is that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because the face has been fading. The text states that they have tooken pictures of this Face on Mars and both times they have the face becomes unnoitcable. For Example: When one of the people went out and took a picture, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West.""

Another reason for the Face on Mars to be just a natural landform is because of no real proof leading to aliens being there. The passage states that no aliens have interloped the area or anything. The text showed that overtime the face has deceased of showing up. The Garvin states that the Face has come down to looking like ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

FF56A22D6714,"Do you think The Face on Mars is natural? As a scientist at NASA I sure do! I think it is natural because we (NASA) released the pictures within a few days of taking them. Also, the pictures would show any alien markings. Finally, the story says that there are some of those formations on earth. I truly believe that it is a natural formation.

We, NASA, released pictures of The Face on Mars just a few days after we took them. Would we do that if we believed it was evidence of alien activity? Would we want to show that to the public, I don't think so! If we believed that it was alien related we wouldn't show the public and get them riled up. It would be nonsensical. I highly doubt that we would show the public if it was aliens.

Don't you think our top of the line cameras would show any alien markings? In the passage it even says each pixel from our camera is only 1.56 meters! That is a very large zooming ability! Our cameras are very expensive, and are top of the line. We use those cameras for the reason of seeing very small details like markings and any other little things. I really think our cameras would have picked up any alien markings, if there was any!

Finally, there are land formations like that on our own planet, earth! There are what we call mesas found all over the American West, which is the same things as the formation on mars. The mesas are formed from a lava dome. Also we know that something like that can happen on mars just like it can on earth. I think the landform is a mesa just like we have on earth.

Is The Face on Mars natural? I think so! I think that because NASA would not release pictures like that if they thought it was alien related!

5F7D4A139216,"Alien life on Mars seems a little out of this world. If they haven't made contact with us by now what are they doing? Some of the alien hopefulls say that there are some major signs like the Face on Mars. Well it's not a sign of any sort, because of some reliable research. This resaerch includes increadible images of it from spacecraft and that its simialr to natural formations on Earth. These reasons are why the Face on Mars is just natural, not alien made.

First of all, the Face on Mars was first discovered when the Viking 1 spacecraft took pictures over the Cyndonia region of Mars in 1976. The pictures looked like an ancient Egytian face but after studying them a group at the Jet Propulsion Lab said that it was only a common mesa with shadows that played tricks on your eyes. Then again in 1998 and 2001 clearer photos of the face were taken. They showed that it was only a massive rock.

Secondly, it is been said to be a natural landform similar to those in the American West. The Face on Mars is just a butte which occurs when lava domes into an isolatd mesa. Scientist Jim Garvin says, ""It remids me most of Middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" So this ""face"" is almost like a natural landform right here on Earth acorrding to the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program.

Although, these points are valid how can we tell what the Face on Mars really is untill we actually go there. For all we know the pictures are being obstructed by Martian clouds or that NASA is releasing false images. But, why would a space angency always in need of some more funding for even more research want to hurt itself by not releasing real images. Also why would NASA mess with the most clear, powerful, and detailed images of the Face that they have from not being right there hovering over the rock formation.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural rock formation with some cool shadows. There is full proof evidence that shows this to be true. There is the fact that its just like other formations in the area and on Earth and that there are some amazing pictures of it taken years apart that only get more and more detailed.

Outsiders, some of them at least, thought it had something to do with aliens and a conspiracy theory, but NASA didn't seem to agree and thought it was nothing but a landform and a picture taken at the right time.

Even thought the figure does seem quite mysterious doesn't mean it's and acient alien artifact. Becuase of technlogy and how cameras dont always capture what really there. For instance, ever taken a picture of a sunset and the colors didn't look the exact same as they did in person, well, this might be the same case. ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face."" The camera might have taken the picture in a way that the human eye couldn't see. It might have added extra, or inhanced shadows making it look like a face. You'd also have to think about the angle the picture was taken in. Maybe in person from a different angle it looked like nothing but a rock, but when a picture is taken and the shadows have changed it looks like a real face with eyes, a nose and even a mouth.

Meanwhile back down on planet earth some people may be going insane and think that this has something do to with aliens and a conspiracy theory. There is no proof that the landform has anything to do with aliens except for its odd shape. Since there is no known life on Cydonia people don't know what type of strange weather or temperature changes they could've had that effected the shape of it. People tend to think what they want to believe and not look at the facts. They like to ignore whats really there and think what they want to think to create some type of excitment in their life. ""It has starred ina Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years."" Then when a small amount of people started to think this had something to do with aliens more people started to believe also, and thats when it went viral.

However, since no one has been down to see the strange landform nobody can confirm that it is either just a landform or an alien artifact. And it is a strange looking figure and sort of unexplainable so I can see why people first thought it had to do with a conspricy theory. But there are more reasons for it to be nothing but a landform rather than an artifact. The best thing to do is look at the facts and not believe what you want to believe just because it is exciting.

The first reason the Face is a landform is that the Face is similar to an Earthern landform like a mesa or butte.

I beleive that there are shadows, on mars that make it look like a face i argue that there was no, alien monument on mars that it is just a illusion caused from the shadows on mars. this face on mars could just be another Martian mesa which are usually common enough in cydonia.

We have seen strange objects in the sky, strange ""ships"" and UFO's and what not.

There is no way the face on marse's surface was made by aleans because we have photographic images that prove so, and by telling it was made by alien it would just help us. So if you really think that that the alience made the face on mars then you don't know any of the facts.

First of all we have the picktures to prove it. So maybe the first one wasn't as clear becaus of the times, but the next one was ten times better. It doesn't sound like a lot but for what the first one looked like was like eating fake oreos to the real ones. But that was on a cloudy night and because it was you still don't belive it. So we went and took an other one (even thought it was hard sence we dont pass it very often). Nevertheless we got it in all of its NON alian glory. With the next picture we got in 2001 you have to belive us that it was a rock. It was 43 meters per pixel compared to the first that was 1.56. If you dont know what that means then let me just tell you it was way better.

Also why would we ruin a great oportunity like that. If we had said it was from alien we would have goten so much money. Imagen all the questions that would have been asked that we might have not have been able to answer on earth. People would start demanding their questions be answed and we would not be able to do it. So we ask for money we would get the best to make it posible for us to get to the red planet and boom we are on mars and we make an other small step.

So if you want to look stupid and belive that the aliens made a face on mars then do so, but the facts are that there is not one.

We have pictures and a want to go to mars that wont happen to prove it. And if after all that you dont belive me then writ your own paper convincing everyone it is a alian made Mount Rushmore and maybe NASA will Get to go to mars sitting on a rock.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.4

There are mesas on Earth and other planets like Mars,too. Landforms can look like they have eyes, nose, and mouth. But they are wrong. The eyes, nose, and mouth are probably crevices on top of the mesa

There are pictures that are snapped ten thousand times sharper than the original Viking photos. We could see if there were alien markings on the mesa because we could use a digial image three times bigger than the pixel size. Mesas are common around the Amerian West inthe desert, just like on Mars. A lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa around the same size as the Face on Mars.

Also from the new pictures from Mars Global Surveyor in 2001 shows great detail. It was taking in a cloudless summer day. There for the image of the picture wasn't ubstructed by any clouds. So the scientist at NASA could study it and determine if there was life on Mars or not. But as I said before Scientist have narrowed it down to either be something similar to a mese or butte.

3B73A2616FCE,"Over twenty-five years ago a face was spotted that looked almost like an Egyptian Pharaoh, but was soon found out that this was just another mesa in the Cydonia region. Once this was seen by alien theortists though, they really believe it was made by aliens, but here's my reasoning why they are wrong.

When the Face was first spotted by NASA's Viking 1 spaceship, in 1976, the scientists in the Jet Propulsion Lab were amazed by what they saw. Though it was only a little while when the scientists figured out it was just another Martian mesa, but the shadows around it gave it the illustion of a face. Once this was released to the public not my people believe it was a mesa. The alien theortists said, ""The Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars."" Even when the defenders of NASA said, ""Wish there was an ancient civilzation on Mars."" This still did not make the alien theortists want back down.

Years later, in 1998, Michael Malin photographed the Face with his Mar Orbiter Camera. This picture was ten times sharper than the Viking photos years before. Soon thousands of people were waiting for the Face to appear, but when it did, it was shown to be a natural landform, no alien formation. Even when shown this, many alien theortists said that the clouds were blocking the alien markings.

In 2001, Mars Global Surveyor took a picture of the Face. There is no excuses on whether or not this is a mesa or an alien formation. The sky was clear, the picture was 1.56 meters per pixel, than the Viking fourty-three meters per pixel. There is not argument that this a natural landform. Even if there was something as big as the Egyptian pyramids or as small as a shack, you whould be able to tell what it was in a picture like this. After that picture was taken Jim Garvin said,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho."" also, he said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated measa about the same hieght as the Face on Mars.""

This is proof on whether or not the Face is a natural landform. After the first sighting in 1976 to the lastes picture taken in 2001, the Face on Mars is clearly a natural landform, not a alien formation. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.4

The pictures of the giant 2-mile long face taken on Mars sparked a lot of attention.

Especially conspiracy theorists.

Causing all kinds of accusations against NASA and if the face found on Mars was alien or not.

There are plenty of reasons why this land formation is natural. Such as, the image, taken plenty of times, revealed no alien artifacts or marking that would seem unusual to NASA's Mars Global Survey team.

The land form is called a mesa, which is found commonly in the American West.

Also, saying that NASA is hiding the real alien information would make no sense, it could benefit them exponentially.

The landform, when first captured on photo, triggered skeptics. Saying the image should be retaken due to the low quality. When retaken, they were, of course, not satisfied. When the final image was taken, it revealed no artifacts. A disappointment to not only those conspiracy theorists, but to NASA too.

The name of the landform, was uncommonly known, as a mesa.

A mesa is a naturally occuring landform that resembles the characeristics of a face. They form from collapsed lava domes or my the simple means of erosion. They are commonly found in the American West. One famous one that resembles the Face on Mars, as said by Jim Garvin, chief scientist on the Mars Exploration Program, is Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is an odditiy to see.

When faced with all the vidence, people began questioning if NASA was hiding the evidence. NASA has made clear that they did not hide anything. NASA supporters have also brought up the simple fact that proving alien life is real could benefit NASA. They would have no reason to hide it and the government could not benefit from hiding this information either. The discovery could get them funding for future expeditions and further discoveries.

The evidence is plain and simple. Alien life on Mars is not there. WHIle many still believe and argue more. The famous face is a landform, discovered through muliple images and NASA has said they have no reason to hide anything from the public. We have the right to know everything.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.6

Scientists have proved that the face on Mars was created by a huge rock formation. The image taken on Mars in 1998 revealed that the face is really just a natural landform. Therefore, there was no alien monument after all. Perhaps people wanted to think the face on Mars was created by aliens just so it couold be a good story for a magazine or Hollywood film, but that is not true. Scientists have revealed how the landfrom is equivalent to a butte or a mesa, which are commonly found on Earth.

With the evidence provided from scientists, the claim that aliens made the face on Mars has been proved incorrect. There is no evidence that prove that the landfrom has been created by aliens. In conclusion, aliens did not make the landform on Mars. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.4
44C7E9C4260F,"Finding a rock-like formation on Mars was one of the biggest dicscovories NASA has made. They first say it in a picture taken by one of their satlights called Viking 1.

The shadows over the object looked made the formation look like a human face. Scientist called this formation on the red plant Cydonia. The scientist said that the face was about 2 miles long. When NASA announcded this to the public they called it a huge rock formation. Later NASA started making conspiracy theorist. When NASA took their second picture the public waited till they announcded the picture. Later some of the people got in a fights saying that it was a Natural landformation or it was created by aliens.

The face is just a rock formation. When the Viking 1 took the picture it said that the shadows made the formation look like a face. Scientist confermed it was a Mesa. They said that the martian mesa was common enough around Cydonia. The third picture provide it was not a face their was nothing similar. NASA's people who spend the money really wished it was a ancient civilization on Mars. They thougth that you could not see some parts of the mesa is because haze was blocking some of it. The last time scientist looked into this they looked at the seroundings and could not find anything.

NASA is afriad of saying there is an ancient civilization, they are makeing conspiracy theorist to cover it up. Over time the dust on Mars could of covered up the the alien artifact. When they took a picture they said it looked like and Egyption Pharaoh. The people who took the pictures could have changed it to make it look like nothing was there. People believe that the fas was covered by haze and so you could not see it. The picture they took could have been from another mesa because the scientist say that it is not easy to get a picture of this. They also said that they can not always take a picture with it because it circles Mars.

The rock formation was not man made it was a landform. The only thing different about these is that they remind people of the Snake river Plain in Idaho. If there was and civilization we would have found more then just one formation. Every thing around the mesa is normal there is nothing different. Scientists used different sights and took pictures and they all look like a rock formation. There could have been somthing covered but not in that area.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.4
D6EFFD7C6FE6,"The face found on Mars is just a natural landform. It is considered a natural landform because there is no proof that aliens made it. We also have yet to find any type of life form on Mars. They have investigated this face since 1976 to 2001.

There is no real evidence or proof that an alien made that face on Mars. It was first noticed in 1976. It could have been there way before then. Its a natural landform because as the planets move around the sun that could make the land make any type of shape that no one has any control over. There is also no proof that aliens are real either so it could really be from anything.

When NASA first spotted this face, they didn't have the best cameras back then. Once it got to the media everyone was coming up with there own theories about how the face got there. NASA caption noted it as a ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth."" Thhe public took it out of hand and said it was created by aliens and didn't have any real evidence.

On April 5, 1998 when they flew over the planet for the first time and got a sharper picture of the face, the picture revealed that it was a natural landform. There was no evidence or proof that an alien made it.

In conclusion, the face found on Mars is just a natural landform formed by shadows and gives off illusions. It was most likely formed because of the planets spinning on the axis around the sun. The sun and other weathers, such as rain and snow can cause the land to form into anything from erosion or deposition.    ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.4
B55E154D6BE3,"What would you do if you saw a picture of a human face on the ground of another planet? If you were like millions of Americans in the world in 1976 you would automatically assume the worse. That it was some type of communication from aliens or that it was a warning that aliens from Mars were going to come to Earth. In the end these people where wrong and started to commonly be reffered to as conspiracy theorists. The human faces of Mars are really just natural landforms and NASA has been proving that for years.

If you were one of the people told to discover the truth about the faces would you stay calm, or buckle under the pressure? Many people in NASA stayed calm and put together compelling evidence that the landforms were completely natural occurances. In paragraph two of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."" it is said that ""Scietists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusualy shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" This shows that the landforms were common on the planet, this certain one just had unusual shadows. Nothing to be afraid about, right? For most people no, it wasn't, but some still weren't convinced and one thing to blame was Hollywood.

Have you ever seen the face on mars, maybe in a movie or on a magazine? If the answer to that quoestion is yes then you are like most people around that time. When the face was made public many people and buisnesses jumped on the idea of telling the world made up facts or lies about the face, that it wasn't a natural occurance or that it was a sign from aliens. In paragraph five of the article it says ""It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-- even haunted grovery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide..."" This proves that people jumped at the idea of going against NASA and telling the world that the Face was something to fear, instead of something to admire.

After another spacecraft was sent to take a picture people still weren't satisfied. In paragraph eight it talks about how the second aircraft that took a picture was stuck behind clouds and people thought the image taken may be distorted in some way. To please the people NASA sent another aircraft to Mars to take yet another picture, but it wasn't easy. In paragraph nine it says ""Mission controllers prepared to look again. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" says Garvin... Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in a narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. ""We just don't pass over the Face very often."" This statement proves that NASA would do anything to prove the landform was a natural occurance and when the picture came in, the doubts stopped. In the last paragraph it is stated that ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" This put to rest the crazy theories of alien communication and proved what the face really was, a naturally occuring landform no different than others of its kind.

When you first heard about the face did you believe NASA's explanation or the Hollywood version? If you did believe NASA good job, not many people did, but if you were one of the Hollywood believers that is okay. Hollywood manipulated the face to make it look like something it wasn't and people believed them. In paragraph five it says ""The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon."" This means that you were not alone. The theorists believed Hollywood in what they said about the face. They also thought that since NASA was sending so many aircrafts to get a picture of it, they were just trying to cover up the truth. This is what many people thought for years, but finally the truth came out.

Now the ""Face on Mars"" is still big in Hollywood, but more to the truthful side. Less and less people believe the conspiracy's thoughts and ideas about the face and started to believe the facts. For years people were in the dark about what the face really was and when it came out people still denied it, but slowly began to warm up to the idea, that the face was a landform, much like the ones here one Earth and maybe people will remember this the next time we find something phenominal on another planet.",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.8

These things happen a lot, you can get a lot of diffrent shapes and sizes from natural landform this one on mars just happens to look like a really realistic face. Plus the ""face"" has changed alot from 1976 to 2001 and we saw the face change with no alien near by changing it and not cause of the camera but because this natural landform is getting older and soon you won't ever be able to tell it was there. There will be other natural landforms and might look like a face. The spacecraft circling the planet would've caught an alien near by . Also it looked alot more like a face in 1976 because the landform is changing and moving so the ""face"" moves and changes with it. Then the team went out there to snap photos and all they got was a sharper view of the ""face"", and no one near by except them. There could be a lot of landform shapes, one could look like a animal or something. These landforms can look like a lot of things and be natural landform and can be creating without aliens. So far we haven't had any proof of aliens ethier.

Like i said if an alien did this we would have know by now. In various researches they have said and wrote that this is a natural cause. I actually do have prof and evidence about my opinion.

I also see why you all think this. Many of you think that there are alien markings hidden by haze. But I think this is wrong, because they again took another picture and again it showed nothing of alien like. All that was in the picture was a big landform that is also common in the United States. Like i've said this is just natural occuring stuff.

This happens on earth because of lava when it gets cooled. The same thing happend on Mars. There is absoultly nothing to lie about or freak out about.

This is true, people are also questioning if aliens had put it there, it may just be a historical formation on the earth, reasearches believe it may just be a formation and not created by aliens. People have named this formation the ""Face on Mars"" it has become to be a very popular sight that people are wanting to see more and more of it. This is so popular that it has been in ""Hollywood films, appearded in books, magizines, and even talk shows.""

Researchers found this figure on the planet mars, they found this not only weird but very interseting. They thought lets do more research to find out what actually caused this formation on mars. Reasearchers thought at first that aliens had put this figure on the planet because it is a figure of a human face. They took big cameras up into mars and sized the figure so large so they could get closer pictures of the image.

The more research the reasearchers did the more facts they found. They had many sightings like this before and they figured maybe a alien did not put that figure on mars. Reasearchers may have thought this because there had been many different formations on earths surface, it was most likely caused by earths erosion or natural features. They compare some ideas to it just like the ""Middle Butte in the snake river of Idaho."" There had never been sightings of aliens before why would there be now.

The people that work for NASA believe that it most likely ended up being a formation in mars because of the research everyone has done they have come to find that there are most likely no aliens up on mars. They say this because they went back up and looked some more around the area where the face was found to see if there was a ""alien monument."" Come to find out there was no alien monument around or even located on mars so aliens did not cause this. Researchers believe that this was just a normal formation from the planet mars that just occured, but did people?

When this all came to take place the first day they let the news out it went viral. People were wanting to know what caused this and how was this caused. When they realesed the news from the NASA they thought the same thing well it had to be aliens. After all this was no formation by aliens it was simply a formation from the planet itself. After all of this was figured out what really caused it, it went more viral than it was before. It was more popular because everyone was talking about it and it occured in Hollywood movies,Books and even talk shows.

In conclusion, the head that was on Mars was actually created by landform, not by alien because if it was created by alien then they would have seen them when they orbit the Mars and also it is not alien monument it is actually the ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west"".

E6A83081A10D,"Is it or isn't it? I think that it isnt. There are too many reasons why it is just a landform and not a human. For example it says ""A few days late NASA unveiled the image for all of us to see. The caption noted ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head"" this is why I think it is a landform.

Another reason I think it is a landform is because as we got closer to the ground of Mars is got clearer and clearer. It came out to be a mesa. In the 70's they didn't have to best cameras so it looked a little blury and came out to be a face.

As cameras got better and better it became clearer and clearer. If they were to do it today they would really see what it was. The text says ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

This means that it was proven that it was a land form. If it was a human or a living creature we would be able to tell. Some people think it was a conspirasy. I think it was because if it wasn't we would still be looking at it.

D465830AD6E2,"The face on Mars is it a alien message or a natural landform.

I would say it is a landform. Why I will give several reasons why I think it is a landform latter in the argumentative essay i will be typing for Istep.

One reason I think it is a landform is how in the world could aliens bulid such a good looking face that looks a lot like a real human. I don't get how would the even know what a human even looks like. If they had some sort of device the going around Earth taking pictures of us would NASA already know about it or the National Goverment.

My second reason why the face on Mars is a natursl landorm. Is how could the make it when it is made out of rock. Did they go find a rock and start just carving a human face into it, NO you want to know why because things like that on Mars can't be used, Why because if they could be NASA would have traveled to Mars by now. PLus how would they move heavy equipment to mve the rock with out NASA seeing it, we have several microscopes going around different places of Space looking at different plants and such. So how could they not have seen that.

And for my thrid reason why the face on Mars is a natural landform. The text stats that their was no sigh of alien sighs or symbols the made us think that the aliens made this creppy looking face. BUt people say sense the 1998 trip to Mars was very cloudy when they toke the picture of the face. So they had to go back for a third time in 2001 a final prove that it is a natural landform and that is what they did. They shot a amazing photo that provide that there was no alien sighs or symbols by the face or around it.

The 3 reasons I gave you today are reasons why this face is a natural landform not any anilen made thing. That would be creepy and not right in my eyes. And maybe other peoples eyes. But to some people they think this is a alien made face which makes them crazy because it is definently a natural landform made form high winds and strong storms.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.4
76FB1AA37D97,"Did you know that there has been an ongoing debate between Nasa and the society? The debate is about whether or not the imprint on mars's platform that appears to be a face, was created by a natural cause or by an alien. I had done some scientific study on the situation myself, being that I am a scientist and I believe that the imprint was indeed made naturally.

some eveidence to back up my claim would be that in paragraph 12 of the article i used as a part of my scientific study is that what the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. This reminds another scientist named garvin, of the middle butte in idaho. A middle butte is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars. This is proof that the imprint was made naturally and not by an alien because lava domes are made naturally which is what the face on mars is.

In conclusion, my opinion is that the face on mars was made naturally on the platform. I have done research on this very subject and i am positive that my hypothesis is right.                ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.2

There is no such thing as aliens people just started a story or rumor about living human beings on mars with green flesh and a big oval head and small body. They even took closer pictures of it to find out what it really was and went slower by it to get a better angle an view and it was no living creature.

People who heard about the face on mars assumed it was aliens because of what people told them instead of listening to NASA and what they had to say about it. Even a few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact. So on April 5, 1998, when Mars global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time ever Michael Malin and his (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

But not everyone was satisfied with the pictures because the face on mars is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was April '98 a cloudy time of year so they went took it again April 8, 2001 a cloudless day in Cydonia and they took pictures very close up.

All of the world allredy knows that it was a huge rock formation with human charatictics with shadows giving it eyes,an nose, and a mouth. It was just tooken at the right place at the right time. It was just another conspiracy theory waiting to erupt.

The only reason that NASA hasnt told the truth is because do now how much fame they are getting off of this right know. They knew it was a rock from the beggining. So even on April 5,1998 when they got caught red handed from a picture they took ten times sharper then the viking they kept the story going. They even went as far as saying that the aliens had errased it. LIke how far will they go with this thing. All of this because of a huge rock and a mistaken picture. So when people still wanted more and NASA did to they tried again hoping for a mirical. They still wanted more out of this rock. The only reason NASA didnt shut this down was because they need the fame and money. This picture ended up becoming a pop icon. It starred in a holloywood film,appeared in magizines,radio talk, and shows. Whey would they think of shuting it down. So they led people into thinking that this was some alien race marking. So when things were dying down they hoped for another miricle and sent anothe spaceship up into spacejust to show people it was just a rock again.

So out of this rock they ended up getting a couple years of fame and a very large fan base. To this day Nasa keeps the roomer going around. I think this picture was just and accident that turned into a trophie for NASA.They made sure to make the most of it but knew they couldnt hold it for long. They knew it was a perfect story to spark a conversation between thousands of people so theybrought it out just to do that.

Then when they put that photo out of the face on mars people were using it in haunted grocery stores checkout lines, radio talk shows, magazines, books, and hollywood films.

Then even some scientists belived that they face was an alien artifact so when people did not belive them they went and took more picture of the face but it was mars cloudy day and people still did not belive them. So NASA went back for another one but to get a better picture they had to get closer to the face and role the ship twenty five degrees to the center they also had to go over the face very often because it was hard to get the picture.

The spaceship would look over mars like a faxing machine but lucky for them going around the face very often it got to a point to were their was no clouds and they were able to get a good shot of the face. So NASA was able to get a better picture of the face so that people would belive them that it was a face in the surface on mars.

The face was not accutally formed from the viking 2 but from a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on the moon.

Conspiracy theorist believe there was alliens involded in the makeing of the ""Face on Mars"".

2AE0D00CAD7D,"In this essay I will be writing an argumentative essay over ""The Face on Mars"" theory. This is a very argumentative subject that can have two sides to itt based on the factual evidence in the passage.""The Face on Mars"" was consider to have been made by alien lifeform. ""The Face on Mars"" is 2 miles long and is a major pop icon.

I think ""The Face on Mars"" is just a huge rock formation that was formed by the planet's weathering and erosion from nearby rocks. Since this planet has a rain season and has a very windy winter, it could've been made by weathering and erosion. Another thing that makes me believe that the face is just a rock is because the dark eyes, nose, and mouth look like shadows from the camera and the sun. One last thing about the face is that if alien lifeform made this why woud they make it 2 miles wide? This has just been one side of the argument, I will write the rest.

I think that this face is made by alien lifeform because it really looks a face. This face could've possibly been a temple or worshiping place for these lifeforms long ago. It could've been a tomb for their leader or king that might've died. If these aliens were going to make a rock this big and that wide it would be for someone or something to catch it's eye. So aliens could've made this or they might not have.

I think that ultimately this is just a coincidence because if aliens are real or were real we would have got aa picture of one or saw some remains of one. And the rock is probably just a mesa or a big landform that was made by weathering and erosion. The face of the rock is most likely just shadows from the camera angle and the sun. And another thing, when the camera passed over the mesa, it was a cloudy and rainy day, making the camera lens wet.

I think that the rock is a mesa. The proof is in the article and it would have been noticed in the pictures if there was aliens living on Mars. So the non-alien side wins this argument over this one. The rock is not a face it is a normal rock.          ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.4

FBE4AAD08E49,"Do you really believe the face on mars was made by an alien? Well my name is Sydney, and im a scientist here at NASA.Im here to tell you the truth about the ¨Face on Mars.¨ Lets begin by telling you the how the face on mars was discovered.

In 1976 ¨Vikings 1 spacecraft was snapping photos for possiable landing sites for Vikings spacecraft 2,when a human face appeared¨At first scientist like myself thought it was another Martian mesa,but something was different about this one. There was an odd ¨shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.¨

NASA took the image and unveiled it for the whole world to see. Once the world saw this image people went crazy over it. The ¨Face on Mars¨ was in ¨movies,magazines,radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery stroe checkout lines.¨ But then people started taking it to far and coming up with there own ideas. People started to say it came from aliens,I know how crazy.

Some scientist at NASA even started to believe what the people were saying. Then NASA decided to go up to mars to get another picture of it 18 years later. They said it was important to taxpayers. ¨On April 5,1998, When Mars Global surveyor got over there his team snapped 10 pictures of the face.¨

When the pictured was taken it was ten times sharper than the Vikings picture. So when the picture appeared on the JPL website,it revealed a natural land form. So After all it was not an alien monument. But wait were not done yet. People were not satisfied because they said the picture was taken at the wrong angle and on a winter day which was cloudy.

Then on April 8,2001 on a summer day and no clouds,Mars Global Surveyor was close enough for a second look. With the teams camera they captured an extraortdinary photo. With this picture you can blow it up three times bigger to see what it really is. The team blew it up and showed it was a butte or mesa landform,most commonly found around the American West.

During all of this I have learned that what looks to be a face was actually a landform. The Face on Mars turned out to be neat because it got used in movies,and ect. It also led people imagineation to think that well maybe there was life on mars before us. So next time what you see can look like something, but turn into something way different.

Some people think the face on Mars is an alien artifact. Although a few number of people think it is an alien artifact, it's actually not. The face is just another boring old natural landform. There was an image captured on the Mars Orbiter Camera of the face and it revealed it was a natural landform. The image first appeared on a website called JPL web site.

There are lots of different opinions about whether it is an actual face or just a landform. Conspiracy theorists say the NASA would hide the ""real"" truth about the Face. They also say that the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. Evidence and a lot of pictures suggest that it is a natural landform.

If it was a face, then why would it be the only one we see.

If this was a face, would it have been the only living being on Mars.

If it were a face, it does clearly resemble that of a human, but no human has been to Mars.

You could say maybe humans began civilization on Mars but we had to leave for whatever reason and when we got to Earth we suddenly went into a stone age, and that face was from a human that died on Mars, but that would have to have been millions of years ago and the ""face"" would no doubt have been buried in the sand.

If you are not yet convinced that this is just and landform that coincidentally looks like a face yet, then here are some more arguments.

In paragraph 7, it talks about how they took a much better quality photo of the ""face"" and it appeared to be nothing more than a landform.

You could also argue that maybe the sand covered up the facial features, but why wouldn't it have done that a long time ago?

Wouldn't that mean that whatever kind of species it was died recently?

If so why don't we see millions or thousands or hundreds or even tens of this species?

Was it the only one ever to exist on the planet.

If it Mars were sustainable for this creature, then it would clearly be sustainable enough for more creatures to appear just like it.

Also NASA scientists are no doubt more qualified then any average citizen when it comes to topics about other planets, and even they appear to think that it is just a landform.

If it was a face, this would prove that there was life on Mars which could benefit NASA, so they ultimately would have no reason to keep it from us.

But, because this was taken a cloudy day people believed it was an alien haze. Therefore on April 8, 2001, they took another picture on a cloudless day in Cydonia.

The spacecraft took a picture on m aximum resolution, which was far batter and clearer than the 1976 Viking photo. If any pyramids, shacks, or lifeforms were there we would have seen it, that's how pixelated the camera was. The photo shows that the ""face"" is the Martian equivalent to a mesa or butte rock formation. They compared it to the one in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Also, hollywood films, magazines, and radio talk shows aren't always reliable. Why would you believe a story based on something, with no actual facts to back it up? The actual pictures and evidence are a more reliable source rather than conspiracy theories, movies, or magazine articles. People have too much trust i the media that they don't rely on facts from NASA or other imporatnt officials anymore.

After many experiments on the Face, they discovered that it is a resemblance of a human head. It is just like an illusion, of eyes, a nose, and even a mouth. According to some authors it would be a great way to engage the public and bring some attention to Mars. They finally realized that is has brung some attention! After that hilarious day it was featured in many magazines, books, and etc. This is a enormous way of saying that this face is very engaging and concerning.

According to Mars Global Surveyor, they flew over Cydonia and snapped a picture of the original Viking photos. The pictures showed that it was an actual natural landform. It wasn't appeared to be an alien monument after all this researching. Even after this stage, people still weren't satisfied with the evidence that they had came up with.

The Face shows a Martian equivalent of a butte or messa. After taking time and time again to review the face, it seems to just show a Martian that is equivalent to a butte or messa. "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, "" says Garvin. Which is a dome with lava that is in the form of a set apart messa, but is the same height of the Face.

As a result, the Face is a natural landform. It has a shadowy likeness of a human, it resembles the human head, and it shows a Martian equivalent of a butte or messa. Research has shown that this isn't just an alien monument after all. There can be more thinking to this, can it? Its just a natural landform, which shows a Martian to represent Mars.

was created by alieans. There is definte information that proves anyone wrong that thinks is was created by aliens. First it was proven is was just shadows. Second in 2001 we took a picture in extremely high reslution that shows that is just a mound. Finally if it were created by aliens we would have a man on Mars by now.

The article states in the end of paragraph 2 that is it fake. it says, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah"" This is coming from the leading scientists in the field of space, and that is a small field in witch only a select few get to be in. Just that alone is engouh to prove any conspiracy theory wrong!

In 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor took a picture in its highest resolution, each pixel was only 1.56 meters wide as opposed to the 43 meters of the Viking photos. what the picture actually showed was a Martian mesa, a landform similer to the ones found in the American southwest. The face as it turns out is only just a mesa, and that is nothing special.

Finally if it were created by aliens don't you think we would be there. The funding that would poor in would be more than enough to put a man or woman on mars. Since it is just a rock formation not created by aliens we have ablsoutely no motive to go there, none at all.

41711BAEF49E,"In the text ''Unmasking the Face on Mars.'' There is a face, not just any face but a face that is formed over time into Mars. Some people may say that the face was created by aliens over time that lived on Mars, but their is no real proof that the face was created by one.

In 1976, there was barely anything to be classified that their was even a face, even though it was forming by 1998. Three years later you can see a face clearly on Mars. Seems weird? Not really because it was later then noted a ''huge rock formation.'' The face on Mars was located at 41 degress north martian a latitude where it was winter in April.

Therefore, the face actually shows a Martian equivalent of a butte or messa. Landforms like that are pretty common around the American West. Facts over time has proven that it was just a landform that isolated messa about he same height as the Face on Mars.

Proven with pixels, in 2001 scientist took photos and compared it to the images in 1976. Also, April 5, 1998 the (MOC) team took some pictures revelaling that is just only a natural landform. Spacecraft rolled 25 degress to center the Face in the field of view, making the image more relevent to see up close.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform created over time and is equivalent to butte or messa landforms. Also their is no real proof that aliens can really create this face on mars that took many years before forming and looking more and more like an Egyptian Pharoah formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.4
D065A9C3FF85,"Earlier studies show that there are no alien lightforces on any planet whatsoever. Most people think that aliens hide in the shadows and they will abduct us in our sleep, no. Aliens are another term for forigners or people from other countries, but this was in 1976-2001 when almost everyone believed in aliens. The National

Areonautics Space Administration wasn't created to see if aliens are real or not, is was created to study something in space other than just Earth. Aliens do not excist so there is no possible way that they can make a face of a human from Mars, it is just a natural landform that so happens to look like a face.

The thing about people's imagination is that they'll believe anything that someone tells them. Most people are like brainwashed monkeys about to be tested on. I myself used to believe in ""alien lightforces"" when I was young. People in the late 1900s were very childish and had creative minds. Why would someone even doubt that the image that was taken isn't just a natural landforce, it would be almost stupid if someone would doubt.

In late June last year some man took a picture of something that looks like a UFO, I can now see how people would thing that aliens are real. However this new age of technology has been so equipped with the use of photoshop. People that can photoshop can control almost half of the worlds' minds. The fact is that since aliens aren't real, there is no possible way that they can make a human face from the Mars dirt. It has to be just a natural landform. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.4
61B3A5FC2632,"I understand you think that the Face on mars was created by aliens or some other trype of unknown creature, but today im going to be proving to you that your theories and or accusations are all false. Here are some things to help you see the light of the situation.

First and foremost, NASA wouldn't just release the image of the Face on Mars to the whole world if we weren't sure their was some investigating to do regarding how the landform actually was formed. Not only that but if we weren't 100% sure if the landform was safe towards the lives of our fellow people then we would try to figure out whats going on until we actually tell the public what were really facing up against here, and that's even if we need to release the issue to the world it might be a very minor problem that can be fixed and or destroyed with our amazing team.

Secondly, with the technology we have today our team would've definitely knew something was up the first time we saw it. Honestly, these theories and assumptions that aliens or how other unknown creatures made that face, shows that we are not all on the same page. In certain ways it even shows offense toward NASA by questioning our research.

Finally, if this Face was created by another type of life that we may not know about then we most likely would've known about it by now. Quite frankly I think it's best if we don't ever come face-to-face with those different types of unknown life considering they may be way more advanced than our civilization with more advanced technology and many other things that mankind isn't ready for yet. They may end up being the enemy instead of the friend and that could very much jepordize mankind.

Furthermore, I could go on and on about how this is just another rock on an ever bigger rock, but you will still have your opinions and I will still have my research. I just hope that I have given you a better thought of what this whole fiasco people have caused really is instead of giving them false information. Thank you for reading.

1E5EFF5360E2,"Some people may think that the Face was created by aliens, but it was not. The face is just a natural landform that is a huge rock formation. No aliens were involved in the making of it. Although it has starred in books, films, magazines and talk shows that does not mean it was created by aliens.

To start from the beginning, NASA was just circling Mars taking pictures of possible places where one of the other ships could land. Then it spotted the shadowy rock that looked like a face. A few days after NASA snapped the photo of the Face everyone was engaged in it.

Anyways, the photo that NASA snapped of the Face was not created by aliens. If it was NASA would be looking for any form of life on my Mars instead of just calling it a natural landform.

It was just a landform that was created naturally like the ones on Earth.

In conclusion, I would like to say there is no actual evidence that aliens created the landform or that they exist. The Face was not created by aliens and is just made out of rock that happened to form into the shape of a face and as time goes on it looks less like a face.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.2
060B6D9A9709,"I have been working with Nasa now for three years and not one have I heard some crazy things like this. How can people possibly think they are being reached out by aliens that is just so crazy I cant stress that enough. I think if aliens were real why would they want to be found if they are smart like people think they are because they can fly a spaceship then why would they leave that face there for us to find it.

If I was a alien I would not want to be found because who knows what they would do to me I would be so so frighten its not even funny. The other reason why I dont think it has anything to do with an alien is because where is that face from? Is it from an alien or human? How to we know if its even a face it can simply just be a rock that looks like face we do not know sure. For all we know this picture can actually be fake. They might just have wanted people to start thinking its a face and that we are living under aliens. I think my team in Nasa is just crazy straight up crazy.

So this is what I think about the whole alien thing this is not alien related stuff at all. It was never anything about alien stuff or egyption goddess stuff either its jusyt simply a rock that look like a face nothing more notrhig less.      ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent,0.2

The agrument started because we were talking talking about it an he said that a alien put it there i said impossible. So he got mad at me i said state your reason why you think a alien put it there. He responed that he dont know i said you have to know something but then he saw an picture and he said the picture look like alien heads.

Then i gave him my response he said why you don't think it's aliens i told him i don't belive and aliens. He said thats not a good enough reason because i did not state facts so i told him the reason why i dont belive aliens are real beacuse i never heard one i never saw one with my own eyes and i also said the face dont look nothing like a alien. The argument kept going on because he said i dont know what a alien look like so you dont.

Last, we came together an said we dont know cause we kept arguing about how was a alien and how it was not a alien. He did not like my response when i said i dont know how they look how they sound thats why i said it was not a alien. It also kept going cause i did not like his response he did give me details or nothing. He just told me he look up a picture that look like alien thats why we came together and said we don't know.

1934C9CFDA72,"Do you honestly believe that aliens created the Face ? Twenty five years ago spacecraft was snapping photos of landsites and spotted a shadowy likeness of a humans face. A Mesa.

First, they saw an enormous head which seemed to be staring back at the cameras from the Red Planet called Cydonia. When seen by Mission Controllers, they let off shockness. Shortly after the surprise the sensation was long gone. Few days later, the Nasa invielded the image. The caption said "" huge rock formation"". This resembled a human head formed by shadows with the illison of eyes, mouth, and a nose.

Next, Authors reasoned these images would be a great way to engage Mars and the other people; it did. The ""face of mars' became a huge icon for twenty five years. Soon it dtarred in films, was seen in books and magizines and most favored in grocery store lines. Photographing Cydonia beame a priorty for Nasa when MGS, Mars Global Surveyor arrived agian in September of 1997 which was a long eighteen years after.

Then, April 5, 1998, MGS traveled over Cydonia for the first time. They met Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camer team (MOC) snapped a picture ten times better the the original Viking picture tooking. There were thousands of anxios and very curious web surfers waiting to see tghe amazing phoyo revealing a natural landform , there was no alien monument. Aliens didn't create the image illison. As rule thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger the the origianl size so if there were other objects, you would be able to see them.
