When the photographers took a picture of it, it was as soon as possible. Plus the camera was at its absolute maximum and so u can obviously tell it is a shadow that makes a face. What the picture really shows is the Maritan the same as a butte or mesa land form which is common around the American West. If there were a peron on Cydonia we would be rich finding the greatest discovery of all time. why not have more then just a man lets have a whole colony right?

When Michael Malin flew over it the team got a picture Ten times sharper then the first picture and when people on the internet who just couldnt wait to see what it was guess what they found out it was?

While Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible lading sites of his sister ship Viking 2. He had spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Viking 1 snapped a photo of it and sent it to the Jet Propulsion lab.

A few days later the NASA unveiled the image for all to see. Scientist discoverd that the face was formed by a shadow giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Over the past years scientist believe it would attract more attention to Mars. It certainly did! The famous face on mars became a pop icon all over the world. It stared in many things like hollywood films, appered in books, magazines, radio talk shows as well.

After the big news that the face was a success scientist soon found out that other scientist believe it was an alien artiract. Jim Garvin explained that they felt this was important to taxpayers. He also photographed the face as soon as he could get a good shot at it.

On april 5, 1998 a group of

Mars Global Surveyor flew to mars and took ten more photos, That were sharper then what the Viking 1 took. Thousands of people have been waiting for the images to be posted on the website JPL. Soon after the photos were taken Mars global Surveyor have posted the images there wern't actually alien monument after all.

Many people wern't satisfied with the information that has came back to them including Garvin. Garvin stills believe that the faces that were found were yet to be alien artifacts. Garvin wants them to retake the pictures and do the research again. The Mars Global Surveyor does it agian and they retake the pictures more clearly.

05B240EC2A33,"Have you ever wondered if there are any other living things in the universe? Maybe some where in a far away place, maybe on our neighbor Mars. A picture surfaced during 1976 showing what looks like a face on Mars, people were saying that it is in fact a fact of aliens on Mars, but it could also be a landform.

First of all, the face in 1976 is much more noticable than it is in the most recent picture from 2001. Also, if it were a face were is the rest of its body? Is it just a huge head sitting in the dirt. As well, how would such a huge person fit on the planet? The picture's pixels come in at about 46 meters per pixel. Could a face really be that big. Conspirests can believe that it is proof there is other living things on Mars, but wouldn't finding something on Mars benifit NASA's budget?

NASA could be getting millions if not billions of dollars if they found other living things on Mars. Goverments would be preparing journeys and preparing astronauts to go investigate the face. Also, if NASA was hiding it from the public, the would lose more money because they could start fundraisers to help send people and robots to Mars. They would be credited world wide for their findings. The people who controled Viking 1 and 2 would gain publicity from their findings as well. Why would NASA hide something that could put so much money into research? They wouldn't, it cannoto be anything else other than a landform. Plus, wouldn't we see many other things surrounding the place.

If the face was really part of an extra terestrial civilization, why would they have just a face and no other things surrounding it. Wouldn't there also be a little person or something walking around the place. Some may say that they are all inside teh face, but then shouldn't there be a visible way of entry into the place. They can't just breach a wall and rebuild it every time they want to enter the place. The camera pixels in the most recent 2001 photo is 1.56 meters per pixel. That is shorter than most teenagers, The photo would cleary show some sort of person or another form of transportation in the photo. I personally doubt that the face isn't home to other people who live on Mars. I maybe wrong, but until I can see actual information showing that there is and photos, I don' t believe it.

Maybe one day there will be a voyage to this face on Mars, but until then I belive that it is just a landform. Other people may believe what they want, but it looks exactly like a landform to me. There isn't enough facts to support it is something else, but unless there is a voyage to this place, then it will continue to be just a landform to me.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
86CBCF98F277,"In the Story ""Unmasking the Face on Mars."" The face on mars has apparently been founded in 1976, NASA claimed the the face was formed by a alien, Here is were I come in, The world had made a bunch of movies including aliens from mars, Mars, for hundreds maybe thousands of years have been the 'Aliens home'. Why I think that this 'face' Is just a natural formis because, take the moon for example, there is a whole bunch of hilly things on there, It just so happened that there is a rock on mars that looks like a face. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution.

That is how they captered the 'face' on mars, Of course there it's gunna be an extraordinary thing that there is a face on mars, There are so many thing in the world that are strange and no body seems to find those strange, maybe it's because the 'face' specificly takes place on mars.

huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

This supports my claim because maybe the 'face' is a rock that just so happened to look like a face, NASA sometimes takes things to far when it come to things like these. huge rock formation...."" It basically says that the rock is a formation "".......giving the illusion......"" IT also stated that the rock gave an illusion that is has eyes, nose, And a mouth. I clearly gives out that opinion that if you put it together you get ""A huge rock formations giving the illusion........."" and so on.

I also think that The 'face' Is just a rock the looks like a face, clearly I stated that. Lets just break it down The face is a rock, which apeared on mars, NASA said it gave the illusion that it was a face, NASA also believes that since it was on mars, Aliens created it. Thats what you get when you break down the story, Even if it was created by aliens, who cares, its a rock, there is nothing special about it exept how it looks like a face, just because it was on mars doesn't mean aliens created it. I know being creative is an amazing thing but it's just a rock the formed into a face, just like how over times 300 million years ago when dinosaurs exists the earth was whole, and over time it TRANSFORMED into what it has become now. Notice how i used the word transformed, ...""over time it transformed ....."" in the text... ""Huge rock FORMation.""

A9B3A7E0379B,"Although skeptics are proclaiming that there is life on Mars, NASA has scientifically proven the true, less exciting conclusion: the mysterious face seen on the Red Planet is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa. Photographs from different spacecrafts have revealed an image on Mars that appears to have a ""shadowy likeness of a human face"". Shadows on the object give ""the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Many believe this is a key piece of evidence showing past or present alien life. However, NASA has examined multiple facts to turn down this claim.

In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured the first look at this mystertious figure. While looking for landing sites for Viking 2, its sister ship, the spacecraft came across the Face in a region on Mars called Cydonia. Scientists conluded that the formation was a Martian mesa with shadows creating facial features. Although the claim was made, the image created suspicion in many. What if the Face was an alien artifact? However, on April 5, 1988, Mars Global Surveyor took another photograph, and this image was ten times sharper than the 1976 picture. Again the Face was shown as the same type of natural landform. Finally, in 2001, a third picture of the Face, taken by the latest Mars Global Surveyor, created solid evidence to the past conlusion. Also, a discovery of life on Mars would benefit the comapany of NASA. Therefore, the organization would not hide a discovery of life on the planet, as many skeptics believe the comapany would do so.

The most plausible theory is that the Face a natural Martian mesa. Three photographs from spacecrafts support this claim, and the fact that the landform is in Cydonia, an area with many of these formations, further backs this conclusion. NASA has no reason to hide new scientific discoveries of life on different planets, and the company is not doing so here. Although the discovery of unknown life would be an extraordinary feat, scientists must continue to research into different areas of space, hoping to find evidence for such conclusion.

Some people still believe that the ""Face on Mars"" is the work of aliens. I believe the ""Face on Mars"" is not the work of aliens, but a natural landform.

The article gives good evidence that the ""Face on Mars"" is just another weird natural landform on Mars. In paragraph 5, conspiracy theorists claim the ""Face on Mars"" is bona fide evidence of life on Mars and evidence that NASA would rather hide. In paragraph 3, NASA unveiled the image for all to see in 1976. The caption noted, ""a huge rock formation...which resembles the shape of a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars; which it certainly did just that. The authors of the article wanted to attract attention towards Mars and NASA even claimed that it was a huge rock formation in the caption. Later, stating that shadows gave the huge rock formation the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper and clearer than the original Viking photos.

NASA again stating and proving that the ""Face on Mars"" was just another out of place natural landform on Mars. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. ""Marlin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution."" Here again we can see NASA trying to prove that the ""Face on Mars"" in still just a weird natural landform on Mars. Someone who stills believes that the ""Face on Mars"" is the work of aliens might say something like this. The ""Face on Mars"" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps alien markings were by haze, skeptics claim. However, that was back in April of 1998, and the most recent photo taken was back in 2001. The photo taken in April 2001, the weather was perfect-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The photo taken that year still looks like a natural landform on Mars.

892923AC5CF2,"Have you ever seen the face on Mars? Well, if you have, do you think it's a real face, or that aliens made it, or that it's just a natural landform like the ones we have here? The answer is, that it's just a natural landform. This face that we see on Mars is just a landform that was created over time. Just like the natural landforms created here on Earth. Things like the Rocky Mountains, or as it says in the passage, the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

This face on the surface of Mars had unusual shadows casting down on it, making the face look like an old Egyptian Pharaoh. Many people though didn't believe NASA, so on April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his MOC team took a picture of this mysterious face that was ten times sharper than all the previous pictures ever taken. When the photo was uploaded to the internet, thousands of people were disappointed when they found out that this was just a natural landform, not something alien made.

In conclusion, in the year of 1976, a face was spotted on the planet of Mars. This face was said to be the creation of aliens who were living on the planet. Many people were disappointed when they found out the truth. That this mysterious face was just a natural landform created over time. Even after NASA confirmed that this was just one ordinary landform, people still weren't convinced. So, on April 5,1998, an MOC team went out to Mars, and took pictures that were ten times sharper than all the originals. Thes pictures proved that this was just an ordinary landform that was formed over time. This ""face"" is actually the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa her on earth found in the American West. Chief scientist for the NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, says that the face found on the surface of Mars is actually about the same size as the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

C52C3ED718AD,"In the past, there has been much debate among scientists concerning the ""Face on Mars"". A picture was taken of a certain region of the Red Planet called Cydonia by Viking 1 in 1976. The image developed into what appeared to be a human face on the planet's surface. Some argue it is an alien artifact, but it is just a natural landform.

When scientists first studied the image in 1976, they infered that ""the Face"" was just another Martian mesa. Past research proves that Martian mesas and rock formations are common in the region of Cydonia, where the picture was snapped. Therefore, it is highly likely that ""the Face"" is just another natural landform with uncommon shadows.

Upon releasing the image for all to see, NASA captioned the picture ""huge rock formation..."" along with other descriptions. Some argued that it was an alien atrifact, so NASA decided to attempt something else. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor along with Michael Malin and the Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped another picture of ""the Face"". The articles states the the image was ""ten times sharper than the original Viking photos"". This image proved that ""the Face"" was a rock formation, but there were still skeptics. Some still argued that it was an alien artifact, the picture was taken on a cloudy day, and alien markings were hidden by haze.

So, NASA responded yet again. The article states in the tenth paragraph ""on April 8, 2001---a cloudless summer day in Cydonia---Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"". It also says ""each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo"". Scientists carefully analyzed the photo. In paragraph twelve, it says ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West"". The natural landform on Mars was similar to landforms on the planet Earth.

The similarity of landforms on the two planets prove many things. The image proved that ""the Face"" is just a rock formation with unusual shadows. Also, it adds another similarity between the Earth and Mars. So, for all those skeptics out there, there's a small chance that life may still be out there on Mars.

62D1014CFDFA,"When people first say this ""face"" it was from a picture that the Viking 1 spacecraft took. Additional reasearch and pictures have been done to see if this is actually a face, just a huge rock formation, or an alien monument. It has shown that it is just a huge rock.

I say its only a huge rock because the passage mentions unusual shadows. THese shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth causing it to look like a face. They did not just form any

""face"" that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. So we know now that t was just a huge rock formation with shadows on it. It is not an actual face carved into rock.

The passage mentions that Michel Malin and his MOC (Mars Orbiter Camera) took a picture of the same landform only ten times shaper thn the original. When they looked at this picture it revealed a natural landform. So after all this it wasnt an alie monument after all.

Now the image doesnt show a face and its not an alien monument it is a butte or mesa. Those are commo landforms aroung the american west. So we know for sure not that the ""face on mars"" is actually just a landform with a bunch of shadows that give the illusion of a face.

008B503940C9,"The face was not created by aliens on mars. The things that make it appear as a face are the shadows and the quality of which the picture was taken. The Face is just a rock formation, the fact that the shadows make it look like a face is simply just a coincidence.

If you look at the picture of the Face, you can see the black shadows on the figure, if you were to remove those shadows, it would most likely not look like a face anymore. The passage says ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadowss that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" The passage also says ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving it the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Key word, illusion.

If they do take another picture it has to have the shuttle to where you can see it so the people around the world can say it is in space.

The story is about how NASA took a picture of Mars and a face was seen on the planet. NASA doesn't know if the landform was created by life on Mars, or if it is just a natural landform. On my perspective, I think that the face is a natural landform because I dont think that there is any life on Mars. In these next few paragraphs, I'll be talking about how I think that is is a natural landform

I think that the face is a natural landform because there is no life on Mars that we have descovered yet. If life was on Mars, we would know by now. The reason why I think it is a natural landform because, nobody live on Mars in order to create the figure. It says in paragraph 9, ""It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" in which he is saying that its not easy to know if it is a natural landform at this point. In all that they're saying, its probably a natural landform.

People thought that the face was formed by alieans because they thought that there was life on Mars. though some say that life on Mars does exist, I think that there is no life on Mars.

It says in paragraph 7, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin took a picture of Mars with his Orbiter Camera, that the face was a natural landform. Everyone who thought it was made by alieans even though it wasn't, was not satisfied. I think they were not satisfied because they have thought since 1976 that it was really formed by alieans.

Though people were not satified about how the landform was a natural landform, in all, we new that alieans did not form the face. I would like to know how the landform was formed. we know now that life on Mars doesn't exist.             ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The first reason is that all this time from when they first took the picture to the last time they took the picture it has never been touched or even looked like it was messed by anyone. Proving that the so called ""human face made by aliens"" was not only unrealistic but also doubting Nasa, who has been in work since the first time the United states landed on the moon. Reason two, why would you be doubting a group when they have been working on new technoligy for modern space traveling for a long time. Now your doubting Nasa again and saying that the aliens made the ""human Face"". Doubting Nasa on there work they are trained to do. Nasa even had qualified scientists to make sure it was't an alien face and even confirmed it.

Once again in April 8, 2001 Nasa proved that it was not a an alien sculpture once again. Garvins said "" it reminded him the most of the middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Once again proving that it was not a alien made sculpture.

People still might believe that it was an alien made sculpture. But multiple times it has been checked and everytime it was checked with a better camera. Multiple Nasa teams went through checking this out and still proved it to be a landform.             ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
003CF65C2780,"""So, if you're a NASA scientist, you should be able to tell me the whole story about the Face On Mars, which obviously is evidence that there is life on Mars, and that the face was created by aliens, correct?"" No, twenty five years ago, our Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Us scientists figured out that it was just another Martian mesa, common around Cydonia, only this one had shadows that made it look like an Egyption Pharaoh. Very few days later, we revealed the image for all to see, and we made sure to note that it was a huge rock formation that just resembled a human head and face, but all of it was formed by shadows. We only announced it because we thought it would be a good way to engage the public with NASA's findings, and atrract attention to Mars-- and it did.

The face on Mars soon became a pop icon; shot in movies, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. Some people thought the natural landform was evidence of life on Mars, and that us scientists wanted to hide it, but really, the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. We decided to take another shot just to make sure we weren't wrong, on April 5, 1998. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team took a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos, revealing a natural landform, which meant no alien monument. ""But that picture wasn't very clear at all, which could mean alien markings were hidden by haze"" Well no, yes that rumor started, but to prove them wrong on April 8, 2001 we decided to take another picture, making sure it was a cloudless summer day. Malin's team captured an amazing photo using the camera's absolute maximum revolution. With this camera you can discern things in a digital image, 3 times bigger than the pixel size which means if there were any signs of life, you could easily see what they were. What the picture showed was the butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West.

""But how do we know you're not just hiding things from us?"" You should know NASA isn't hiding anything from the people because if there was evidence of life it would benefit us, so why hide it? If you still don't believe the evidence the pictures are out for you to see, which obviously shows a natural landform. The reason to not believe these movies and magazines is because they ignore the research. They make up things to get the people going, but what they actually should do is pay attention to us, because we have very important findings every single day. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
7DC4F95091B6,"As I know from images and researches that aliens could possibly exist by the looks of it . Not so Postive about it , but why would there be an human face on mars when people aren't on Mars everyday of there lives. Also that by seeing pictures of hwo aliens look there similar too us in a way , but the mouth is weird shping like it's not a human mouth that people think it may be . Makes you have second thoughts and makes you want to investigate more on the "" The Face On Mars "" . Each year we have something new on this face of mars.

So we investigate more on these pictures to see exactly what were trying to find out because it doesn't add up how would I big hu,man face be on mars. doesn't make since too me. Yeah and like "" Garvin "" says we don't pass over a human face very often so something isn't right here. The scientist put there all into this to figure out what there dealing with.

So finally in 2001 we've came to an conclusion and find out from all our investigations that it's really just a ' mesa ' It's an Middle Butte in the Snakwe River Plain of Idaho It's the same height of as "" Face on Mars "".",1,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
500F35F18E1F,"A butte and a mesa these are all natural things on our planet Earth. So why do you think that the planet Mars also can't have these things. Earth is covered in these mesas so more than likely other planets including Mars probably have buttes and mesas, its just coincidentall that it looks like a face. With the other pictures it proves that the mesa isn't an alien artifact and just a natural landform.

If you go out to the Rocky Mountains and look around you can probably see tons of Mesas maybe not as big ,but they are still the same natural landform. The mesa is big and does look like a face at first glance ,but there is no way you can prove it. But for scientists you can back it up with facts not just opinions.

If you look at the image taken from the spaceship Viking 1 from 1976 you can see that only looks somewhat similar to a face. And then 22 years later a picture from a Mars Global surveyor you can see that it very clearly isn't a face and instead just a natural landform.

The only way that this could be an alien artifact is if the martians are inside of it or underneath it. That would explain how the camera can not see any other buildings around the object because they are all inside of it so no one is outside. They also could be inside of the butte because the planet is deadly for some paticular reason and they have shelter inside safely away. And another reason is because inside of the planet there may be some source of running water that is keeping them alive.

Although this could not work because they more than likely would have gotten a picture of a martian outside doing something. And they would need some source of water which has already dried up on the outside of the planet.

In the end it is not possible that the mesa is an alien artifact and is instead just a butte or a mesa that happens to like a face. Because the clearer picture shows that it now looks nothing like a face, water stopped flowing on the red planet a long time ago, and Earth also has these land forms all over the place.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
13EBA3BE41C2,"Have you heard of the photo taken in 2001 that revealed a strange, unusual, ""Face on Mars?"" In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars in search for a landing spot for its sister ship. During the look for a site, the spacecraft noticed something that resembled a human face. This discovery brought up a huge debate between other NASA scientist and conspiracy theorists. The people thought that the Face was a confirmation of life on Mars, but we scientist can ensure you that the Face is just a natural landform. The picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa.

The Face on Mars was discovered on a red planet called Cydonia. When Jet Propulsion Lab seen the photographs captured by the NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, they figured that it was just another Martain mesa. Jet Propulsion Lab came to the conclusion that it was just a mesa because in the text it states, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia..."" From this the reader can infer that mesas are often found on this planet. Not only did Jet Proplusion Lab believe it was just a natural landform, Mars Global Suveyor also believed it was created naturally.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument after all. The spacecraft flew over Cydonia and also captured a picture of the pop icon, the Face on Mars,. The Mars Global Surveyor took a photograph, but ten times sharper than the original photograph from NASA's Viking photos. This picture sure proved that there were no alien monuments. However, people believed it was too cludy to see clearly. Therefore, a high-resolution image from more recent technology offically confirmed that the Face is just a mesa.

Mission controllers from Mars Global Surveyor prepared to take another look at the Face on Mars. On April 8, 2001, the spacecraft flew over Cydonia again and captured a photo as clear as day. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said,"" Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" This photograph showed that the Face on Mars is equivalent to landforms found around the American West.

In conclusion, the picture captured of the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because Marian mesas are common around where it was spotted, Mars Global Suveyor confirmed there was no alien monument, and high-resolution images from NASA revealed that the Face is just a mesa. I believe that this was an amazing discovery and gave us, NASA scientist, a challenge to go out and find evidence to prove conspiracy theorists's accustuations. ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
C79753F72EF8,"If it was an object created by aliens then why would they turn that landform into a human face. There have never been any reports of someone coming close to an alien face to face. Also how would the aliens know what humans look like, they have never even been to earth before. All that face is, is a rock with shadows from the sun to make illusions to the human eye.

The face was used in grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Yes, you may think think aliens did it and there is a chance they did, but that chance is very slim. yes, some scientist did believe it was an alien artifact but that was before they had HD cameras and now we can see the rock clearly. Garvin said that ""If there were objects in that picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were"".

In conclusion, there is no evidence that aliens have created that face and if there was, NASA would do all that it could to prove it a farce. Do not believe everyhting you see online or in books. You might just become too attatched to that topic.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
95830A1822AA,"People believe that this natural landform that looks like a face on mars was done by aliens. Well it wasn't. If it was aliens we would tell you because it would be a benefit for us. People on earth see natural landforms that look like certian things all the time. Not to mention it looked like such a face because the shadows that it casted made it more detailed.

If it was aliens it would benefit us. Like the text states, ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars."" But its not. The text comes back afeterwards and says ""Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on mars."" If it was an ancient alien statue we would say it and back it up, because it would have a highly strong benefit towards NASA because we could get donations for it. Along with more popularity.

Not only would it benefit us, but it looks like natural landforms all across the world. The text even states, """"It reminds me most ofMiddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."""" Not only that but it mentions, """"that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hieght as the face on mars.""""

Why not ask questions about landforms that look detailed or look like aliens may have done it on earth?

The main reason the face looked the way that it did was because of the shadows that it casted. The text tells us, ""Shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" The text also tells us, ""Because of its face like structure it become a great attraction. Starring in films, books, magazines and other articles."" If it weren't for the shaddows then what was the point.

What if NASA is lying? What if none of this is true? WHY SHOULD PEOPLE BELIEVE US? People should believe NASA because again this all would benefit NASA. The text even states, ""Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was ancient civilization on mars."" Not to mention, if it was a sign of human life it would show a dramatic increase of popularity.

So no it isn't an alien statue, or a sign of ancient alien civilization. If it was we would tell you so we could have a benefit or major profit. On Earth we have natural landforms all around that look like actual things made by aliens. Why not question them about those natural landforms? Not only that, the only real reason it looked like a face was because the shadows it casted made it look like it had a mouth, eyes, nose, and other facial features.

EBBC9006CE52,"In 1976 NASA'S Viking 1 Mars Global Surveyor had taken a picture of a face-like form on Mars.

The area that this was found in is common for having these types of forms.

This land form was found in Cydonia, a region on Mars.

This form on Mars is a natural land form, although many people thought it to be created by aliens.

This thought had sparked sudden interest into the people about Mars, when it was released to the public.

Scientists had further looked into it and found it was just a land form.

However, somone had still thought that this was created by extra terestrials because they knew it was winter in Cydonia, so it was cloudy.

They stated that they thought the clouds could have blocked off many features of this land form.

They also thought that if you had taken a clearer picture then you would see many other features explaining that another life form had created it.

The same picture was later on taken in 2001.

This picture had many more pixels to show an HD picture of the object.

This updated picture showed a much more smooth and almost dome-like formation instead of a face.

This led many scientists to believe that this is a natural land form.

Some of the rock's features still had resembled a little bit of a human face.

Before NASA could know for sure wether this was natural or not they made the face on Mars a priority to take more pictures and find where it is and when they did, they had found that yes, it was just simply a natural landform.

In conclusion, NASA had seen a face on Mars and couldn't figure out what it was so they took more pictures as the technology advanced.

This allowed scientists to know for sure that this was a natural thing.

Scientist claim they know the facts of what looks like a landform and they think this is a posibility that this is one of them. Also, We should believe its landforms because nobody has ever seen aliens before they just think that they look like on what they have on social media etc. Even if they look like what we have in pictures that still would NOT be an aliens face!! If you look at the picture it might actually look like a formed face but its not .We should also believe NASA because .. they are scientificly trained to look at these and study things to see and know what they are .. Why would you really believe and think you know whats on the internet instead of believing things that you see! Use research!

Number one, paragrah 10 sates that if there were anything on the ground the camera would of caught it, number 2 is paragrah 11 talks about the cameras ablity to see anything that would help the research of alien life, and lastly paragrah 7 talking about the natural landform.

First, paragrah 10 talks about the difference of the pictures from 1976-2001 with the different pixels. In the fourth sentence it says "" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo"". Earlier in the paragraph it talks about the camera being at its ablsoulte maximum resolution, meaning the camera NASA has aren't cheap, they are high quality and could see anything that could resemble any alien life, which will be disccused next.

Secondly, in paragraph 11 it talks about the cameras ablity to see anything on the ground such as shacks planes, as is I said in the previous paragraph with the camera being at its ablsoulte maximum resolution, this paragrah also says ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added.""So, if there objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground Egyptian- style prymaids or even small shacks, acould see what they were!"" Which brings us back to the camera being its best of class,if the camera is able to see anything on the ground that would not be visable to the naked eye, then why didn't it see anythng .

I know most of you would argue that they are storing equiment in the face. But, in the picture the only holes are the eyes and the camera could of seen any other entry point at this angle.

Lastly, paragraph 7 revells the picture of the face on mars, this paragraph talks about the research, and the release of the picture. Yes this eariler in the story but it all falls into place, they state they snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original picture, the image was first posted on the JPL webstite showing a NATURAL land form, no alien momument at all. This dosen't ptove anything since they just posted the picture, but the previous statement i made fall into place with this one supporting my facts of no alien life on the palnet mars asscociating with the face

""Big News"" NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft has found something while circling

Mars. But what is it, they have seem to have found a face formed into the rocks. Is this new discovery actually a face or is it just another rock formation.

The believers and the non-believers of the face on Mars are waiting anxiously to find out what it is. Is it a rock formation or is it an actual human face, no one knows. The (MOC) has finally released the newest picture which is 10 times sharper than any picture the Viking spacecraft could have taken, and the JPL web seach has revealed tht the face on Mars is actually just another rock formation.

Even though NASA has put the picture out there that proves that the face on Mars is not acually a face but just another land formation, there are still some skeptics out there that think taht the theory is true. Skeptics have said that perhaps since on the day the picture was taken was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet that the alien marking were hidden by the haze. NASA had come to Mars to take a picture of the face at the wrong time and if they were to come another day they might have been able to see that it was an actual face and not just some rock formation.

Around the American West there are common landforms know as butte or mesa and they are actually equivalent to the Martian. Could the butte or mesa landforms be know on other planets besides ours? We are able to get the right size because "" as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"" so be comparing the actual size of the butte or mesa to right about the size of the Martian when we do the math. The land formation on earth reminds people most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho "" thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars"".

37C94D59BAAB,"We all know there are 7 wonders of the world, but could this be the first wonder of the universe. Nature can make some astonishing things. Many things in the world, or even the universe, are nature-made. They have been here since the beginning of time even though they seem to be man-made. The ""Face"" should be included in this category. This ""Face"" was created by natural processes.

Similar to the ""Face"", places on Earth are nature-made. Even though sand dunes on beaches are kept by humans, they were first nature-made. Sand storms on Earth create higher dunes in deserts because the starting dune blocks the sand from getting across it. This may be what caused the ""Face"" to be created. There may have been an oval shaped dune at that spot, and, then, a ""storm"" passed by. The beginning dune blocked the Mars sand from exceeding that barrier, and the ""Face"" we see now was created. The shadows forming the eyes, nose and mouth were created on accident.

Sometimes landforms are created when objects collide with planets. The ""Face"" could have been formed when a meteor crashed into Mars. Only this time the crash did not create a crater, but instead a protruding object that over the years got rounded out by storms. Evidence does not suggest that every single meteor strike causes a crater. The reason that craters are an effect on Earth may be due to Earth's atmosphere or it's magnetic field. This may just be the first time NASA has ever seen a mound created by a meteor strike. There could be more out in the universe that NASA hasn't observed yet.

In April of 1998, a photo was taken that was blury due to Martian clouds. Many people exclaimed that the clouds may have blocked some alien markings. When NASA took another photo in April of 2001, the photo does not seem to portray any alien markings. Furthermore, the ""Face"" looked as though it has cracked on the side. Suggesting that there are Martians on Mars and, along with that, there were Martians that made this ""Face"", why wouldn't the Martians fix their monument when it cracks. This led me to believe that not only did the ""Martians"" on Mars not build this, but, additionally, there are no Martians on Mars.

Others may say that, comparative to the Mound Builder Indians on Earth, the ""Face"" was created by Martians bringing dirt to one spot and creating that ""mound"". If that was the case, then how come, in all of the photos and evidence we have from Mars, NASA has never once seen a Martian. They might be hiding from us, but, like Humans, couldn't Martians have messed up, and they forgot to hide one time.

This ""Face"" is created by natural processes. Even though it has been extremely controversial over whether it is alien-made or nature-made, more evidence suggests that the ""Face"" is nature-made. Many things in the universe can cause a mound on a planet, but finding out which one is the cause of the ""Face"" may never be known.",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

This Face is just a natural landform because scientists proved it, there was no sign of abnormal activities, and mesas are not unusual in Mars.

This Face is a natural landform because scientists proved it was not made by aliens.

This exemplifies how scientists used advanced technology to take an accurate picture of the Face. What they found was that it was a mesa.

Again this shows how scientists took advanced pictures and all they saw was a natural landform.

Furthermore, there was not any abnormal activity to prove it was aliens. Gavin said, ""As a rule of thumb you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This shows how the camera was powerful enough to have shown if it was really an alien monument. Similarly, Gavin states, ""So, if there were objects on this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This adds on to the idea that if there had been an alien civilization they would have been able to capture anything that was out of the normal.

Additionally, these landforms are not unusual on Mars. Infact, there are similar landforms on planet Earth. The article states, ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" This shows how mesas are common in Mars, and they are not strange to be seen. Furthermore, the text states, ""What the picture shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolate mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.'""

However, this specific landform had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh, but the picture tooken byThe Mars Global Surveyor proves that it was a natural landform. This camera took a picture using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

Clearly, the Face on Mars was just a mesa. There was no explanation found of how it could have been formed by aliens. First, there was no evidence found that it was an alien artifact; cameras proved that it was a landform. Plus, mesas are not unusual in the planet Mars.

EC36D0439D93,"The face is fake. there is a lot of evadence that the face is fake. for one,in all three pictures it looks different. also the"" face"" it not even simular to a face. it also says that the camra had to look close to get a pic.

Also another reasion I think that it is fake is because it says that the face looked like an egyotian pharaoh and it has no resemblence what so ever.

I also think tghat maby the face was made by somone from earth so that thay could make people beleve that there are ailens and that thay are probaly were verrry upset because thay thought that ailens were real and that thay were dangerions.

in the paragraph it says that there spacecraft was circling the earth and that they got photos, i dont think that is true because thay also said that thay were trying to havew it get better pics because it was all cloudy. I think that if it was cloudy than thay would not have as good as picturs.

I also think that thay are verry unedicated about the alian subject and that thay think thay are real and even might say that thay dont have any proof. the proof might scare people so much thay might beleve them and thay actully will care abouth if thay are righy.

E8F4BD1D7CFB,"The Face on Mars may look like a alien artifact, but in reality, it is just another natural landform. NASA's Viking 1 found a ""human face"" twenty-five years ago on Mars. It was said to be nearly two miles from end to end. Most scientists just thought it was another common Martian mesa. A few days later, NASA put out the image for the world to see. The authors said it was a huge rock formation that resembled a human head. They also mentioned that the shadows gave the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. It was believed to be just another rock.

Since the story, the ""Face on Mars"" starred in films, books, magazines, and radio talk shows. Many people thought the Face is evidence of life on Mars, but would soon realize it was just a rock formation. Even a few scientists actually believed that the Face was an alien artifact. After these rumors, photographing Mars became a priority. On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped ten pictures. Many anxious people waited for an image to appear on a JPL web site. The image did not reveal a alien monument, but a natual landform.

On April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor was taken out for another look at the Face. The picture shows a buttle or mesa; which are landforms common around the American West. Although the Face was believed to be some type of alien artifact, after three times of exploring, it was still proven to be just another natural landform. ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
8C4DA60A580E,"The face on Mars is a natural landform. We have proven it here at NASA. We have taken pictures on different years and it has shown to change. Our new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from our Mars GLobal Survey spacecraft reveal the face on mars for what it really is. It is just a mesa. This is common on earth on the west side of the United States. Another reason it wasn't made from any alien or creature out there is because the moniters never found any monuments like that one and aliens moving around.

For people who think aliens did this, say that our camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds which we couldn't see much, think the aliens were probably hiding. people who believe in aliens strongly are going to find the slightest detail and use that for their evidence. Since this was a popluar icon more and more people are going to lie and make up stuff to make sure people believe it is true. They already made up a lie that we would rather hide from the aliens. These people are called conspiracy theorists.

The biggest proof we have that it wasn't made my aliens is our digital image. This was 3 times bigger than the pixel size. It would be able to see if there were objects in this picture like monuments or aliens. It could even see small shacks if there were any. Our spacecraft got to look at it a second time in 2001 and could see more better than the 1976 one. There was still nothing to be found but a natural landform.

Even if we did catch aliens in our picture we showed the same picture to the public for all to see. Nobody said they found an alien structure. If we didn't detect neither would anybody else.

This is why conspiracy theorists will always remain conspiraces. Because they have no soild evidence against us. We have acutul research to back us up. We kept looking at and studying it until we finaly came up with an answer to tell the world what it is.                 ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
D26091666C7E,"The Face

The Face that was found on Mars couldn't have been created by aliens. If so where is the proof of these aliens. Ask yourself if you really believe the Face was created by aliens? Dont you believe their would be some sort of evidence after all of the exploring of Mars. In this essay I'm going to write a argumentive explaining why aliens could'nt have made the Face and why I belive it is just a natural landform.

I believe that this Face that was found on Mars could be a natural landform becuase of paragraph twelve. This paragraph says that the Face has resemblance to a butte or mesa, which are common landforms on Earth in the American West. It also states that it has resembalance to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These details are not exactly evidence that the Face is a natural landform, but it gives probable cause to think that it possibly is a natural landform.

For those who feel that the Face was created by aliens, dont you belive their would be some type of evidence of a life form on Earth. As paragraph eleven stated if their were other structures like pyramids, airplanes, or small shacks we would be able to see what they were because we could dicern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. If their were aliens I'm sure NASA wouldn't keep it a secret because they would possibly get more donations or money from people wanting NASA to go up and get even more pictures. Or even for NASA to take people up there themselves like a trip.

Those who belive a alien created the face possibly would say that NASA would keep aliens a secret because it would frighten some people. They also could ask the question how and why did the rock or land for the way it did if its just a land form? For the first statement I can say that could be true, but the question I can't answer. I sure that someone who has studied it could though.

The alien belivers can also say that the aliens hide when humans come to Mars but that is something that can't be proven or disproven.

In conclusion, aliens couldn't have made the Face because their should be some type of proof that their has been life on Mars. Especially since we have photos of Mar's surface and have a rover on its surface. I feel that the Face is just a natural landform because it resembles a butte or mesa and because their is no sort of proof that their are aliens or any type of life form on Mars. Alien belivers could ask the question, how was the Face formed like a face, but I can't answer this question.           ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
85299AD4E6AF,"Was the face created by aliens? According to the text, Mar Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1976, eighteen years after the viking mission ended. The Face is just a natural land form because NASA has not identified who could have done it,they only have images and the Face is in the ground whickh makes it a land form.

NASA does not see these faces all the time. Why is this ""landfrom"" one of a kind? Mars has been a planet for years and only has one Face. Which proves that, aliens could have created this. Maybe it is a self portrait, or a sign. The picture of the face was first taken on April 5, 1998. This gives the aliens plenty of times to create the face. On Mar the landforms are remotly the same because of the climate effects everything in a similar way.

NASA believes aliens are real. If NASA has found evidence that aliens may be real, then why don't they think aliens created this? Aliens could be capable of doing this. The Face could be an alien artifact. Maybe there are more underground built by aliens that you can not see.

This is a landform because NASA only has images. Images cn be deciving , I know from experience. This may look like a face, but is not. Sometimes things are not what they seem. In 2001 they had image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 metere per pixel in 1976.

The Face is in the ground. Being attched to the ground, not made by man is a land form. An alien is not a man even if the face is man created. It is simplily just a landform that looks like something that it is not. On Mars there are other land forms, but they just don't look like a face. The lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa is about the same height as the Face on Mars. This is not made made which makes it a lanform.

NASA has not identifed who could've made the Face. If NASA takes pictures of Mars then they should have pictures of the ""makers"". Therofore this is a landform or else they would have a picture of who could've created the Face .The Face is located at 41 degree angl north martin latitude. No prof of anyone making it. Must be a land mark because lack of evidense

The Face is a natural landform becuse they only have images, it is connected to the ground, and they have not identifed who could've made it. The lack of evidense has caused me to beileve this. It is a landform on Mars and a pretty cool looking one.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
70DDC8684A15,"The Face on Mars is nothing but a natural occurance. On Mars, there are things called a buttle or mesa. Which in fact, is what this ""face"" really is. I know this because in the article, that was based off NASA's own research, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says, ""What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" We have these landforms on our very own planet, so its understandable as to how we can recognize one on another planet.

On top of that, we used top quality equipment to study and research the Face on Mars. This is backed up by how in the article it says, ""Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.

9F84CFA3542E,"The Face: Alien Artifact or Natural Landmark

Do you think that the "" Face on Mars"" is an alien artifact or is just a natural landform on Mars? Well, in my own personal opinion I believe that it is a natural landform because, in 1998 NASA went back to Mars, and took 10 pictures to get the perfet shot. I also believe this because, landforms are common around the American West. Although, some my think the picture is an alien artifact, it is not because NASA went back to Mars with an even better camera and, took even more pictures of the Face.

First of all, I believe that the Face is a natural landform because, in 1998 NASA went back to Mars, from their 1976 expidition, to see if the conspericy theories were correct, and they weren't. In the passage it says,"" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origninal Viking photos."" It also says,""

the image first appeared on a JPL wed site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" I used these sentences because, they prove that NASA is corret, there wasn't any alien activity.

I believe that the Face of Mars is an natural landform because, landforms are common around the American West. The passage says,"" What picture actually shows is the Martian equivialent ofa butte or mesa- landforms are acually common around the American West."" I used thi sentence because, it shows that the landform wasn't a once-in-a-life-time sort of thing, you see them quite offten actutally. That is also something that people who don't believe NASA never take under consideration.

Some people may believe that the Face is an alien artifact, but in all truthfulness it is a natural landform. I say this because, in 2001 NASA got some amazing cameras to take the best pictures that they could possibly take to prove themselves right. In the passage it says,"" Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" I used this because, it proves that NASA has worked really hard to get high quality photos of the Face.

In conclusion, I believe the Face is nothing more that a natrual landmark on Mars because, NASA went to Mars to get more pictures, after their mission in 1976, in 1998. I also belive this because, landforms are common in the American West area. Although, some may believe that the Face is an alien artifact it is not because NASA got high qualiy photos to prove it 2001. What do you think the Face is?    ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
6C95EEFE7DAF,"""The Face''

As we all know in the year of 1976 Nasa's Viking 1 spacecraft captured a photo which was belived to be a ""face'' formed in Mar's surface. There has also been arguments over the years if ""the face"" was created by aliens or was it just a natural landform. Here is why I belive it is a natural landform.

In the article ""Umasking the Face on Mars, in paragraph 12 it says what the picture that the picture actually shows that the Martian is equaivalent to a butte or messa which are landforms common around the American West. Some migfht that you can't actually tell what things really are just from a picture because it is only a proportion. Well, in paragraph 11 Garvin says that ,"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Eqytian -style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were.

Some might say that you can tell by the picture thaat Viking 1 spacecraft took because of the type of technology they were using in the 20th century. Well in paragraph 10 they said that they rolled their spacecraft 25 degrees to center in the Face in the feild of veiw. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camer's absolute maximum reslotion. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters, 43 in the 1976 Viking photo. This tells everyone that they did not make their decsion based upon 20th century technology, but they captured thier photo with morden day technology.

In conclusion, I belive that ""The Face"" was a just a natural landform. I belive this because of the eveidence that NASA provided and the fact that they went back to space and took anthor picture with up to date technology.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
84FFEF07FB0D,"There are many questions about the mystery of the ""Face on Mars."" The article states that the picture of the Face is "" the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" More information about the ""Face on Mars"" is in the following statements.

It has been scientifically proven that the Face is nothing more than a rocky landform. Although it may seem to be formed my aliens, the Face truly is just a natural rock formation. There is no actual evidence of life on other planets. Why assume that just by a mesa? The Face is made up of shadows. You too can probably make shadows that look like something it is not.

NASA has taken photos at different pixel sizes. Not everyone agrees with NASA's statement because they truly believe that NASA is hiding information from them. Talk about the Face began after some people decided that it would be a ""good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Afterwards, many conversations and arguements were about the Face. It became a pop icon once it reached across the nation. Many people paid attention more to what they were watching rather than what they were told by NASA, the people with the facts.

Conspiracy theorists began saying that NASA was holding out on them by not saying the complete truth about their discovery. Much goes into a discovery that shouldn't go without apreciation. Scientists still held onto their beliefs and avoided correction by a few simple facts. The time that the first picture was taken could have been a perfect time that the sun was creating a shadow. I believe that the Face is just shadows that are made by indents on Mars. You would need to have more than pictures of a rock formation to support your theories on whether or not alien-life does exist or not. More goes into a theory if you can support it with proper evidence. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
1D0B32213E00,"Just another day working at the Jet Propulsion Lab. Day's at the Lab went by as any other day for the scientist's, not finding anything new up in space, just a few minor event's here and there, but nothing big. I went in my office, and was informed today we were going to try and find any possible landing site's for Viking 1's sister ship, Viking 2. As usual we went to work. Orbiting Mars for what seemed like an eternity! I'm literally bored out of my mind, until out of the corner of my eye I see something, not just a star or anything, but to my eyes looked like a human face staring right back at us through Viking 1.

Confusion is all us scientist's felt when we saw that face on Mars, just plain fear and confusion. Nothing was spoken much about it among us scientist's since we were all super shocked and speechless, that was until we were on our lunch break. All I heard was ""Alien's"", really alien's can they possibly pin this ""face"" on Aliens! The table next to me also seemed to think alien's made this Egyptian-type face. I dont know what came over me something just clicked and I said ""How can you possibly pin this on alien's?!"" of course this started a one-on-one argument with me and another scientist ""What do you mean, how can it not be Alien's"" he answered. ""First of all, it was spotted near Cydonia, a part of Mars where Martian Mesa's are commonly being found everyday, so how do we not know it isn't just another Mesa?"" ""If you think this is a mesa, how would it take form to look like a human being's face? Dont you think that is too much of a coincidence to happen?!"" at that I left it alone, maybe it was too much of a coincidence, but that wasn't going to affect my thought on the ""Mesa""

The word on the ""Face"" spreaded around the world, becoming a hot topic for people everywhere, most of them thinking it was made by Alien's. I didnt really get much into it until that scientist kid came up to me again, ""Still think it wasn't made by alien's?!"" ""Of course, why wouldn't I?"" ""How can you not think it was alien's! The picture became known to the world and everyone think's it was alien's, which they are probably right!!"" ""How can we know for sure this was created by alien's!? Think about it we dont have great technology yet, that ""Mesa"" was in the form of a face because our photo was too blurry and it was really cloudy!!"" I really didnt want to end up on the wrong foot with this guy so i just walked away.

April 5,1998- I walk into the office and apparently we are going to take a look at Cydonia for the ""Face"" again. This was actually a releif to me, because I know that now our technology is way more advanced and we could see with a sharper picture what this thing really is, a mesa. So it happened Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and took a picture ten time's sharper than the old one! As to my conclusion, the egyptian face ended up to be a mesa! This mesa took form of a face because of the shadow's that went over the mesa. As I heard of this new's I couldn't help but look back at that one scientist, and whipering ""Look who the right one is now!"" with the most accomplishing smirk on my face that I can make. ;]",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

D9B86C17ED6A,"So, you think that this face on mars, was made by an Alien? Well you thought wrong. There are many reasons why this was not made by an alien. It could be the formation of the land on mars or spacerocks hit it, or it could even be something from inside mars. You dont always know. But Im going to explain why.

Scientist have already went up and discovered this face on Mars because at one time, a lot of people though it was a face made by aliens. Everyone was so excited to see pictures and everything. But some of the information in this article thinks otherwise. In paragraph 7 in this article, it explains how Michael Malin, flew over mars and captured sharper pictures of this ""face. "" But it soon revealed that it was not made by Aliens, it was just a natural lanform and there was no Alien Monuments.

A lot of people were dissapointed, but like I said anything could of happend. The people from NASA took a bunch of pictures and did a lot of tests on it and the picture pretty much said the same thing all along. Plus, Aliens were alive 1000 years ago, if that and so why would people think that they would choose mars, out of all the other planets, and burry an alien in Mars, and it all the sudden show back up. Now do you really think this is true? Now I think it is just a formation in land like the article said.

In the article, some people think that the Alien markings were hidden by haze. Thats a logical reason but I still dont think it is realistic enough. If the haze did not show up in the picture that they took, how could they of not saw it. Plus the Article says that the picture that was most recently took, the lenses on the camera was 10 times sharper and better than the photos that the Vikings photo.

Near the end of the Article it talks about how they even went back again that was even better than the 2 pictures before and that zoomed in so you could see every little detail. Then again it came back with the same results. It was a land formation. They think that it was just a lava dome and has the same formation.

So with all of fthat information I think it is pretty reasonable to say that there was no Aliens on Mars and there deffinataly is not a face from them. This could happen on any other planet to. All along it was just a land formation. At the beggining of the Article I also thought that it was a face from the Aliens too but then I went through the article and there is no possible way. Land forms on its own. So with that being said I guess mars formed with a face on it. Plus rocks and stuff could of made the indents in the face to make it look like eyes.

I hope that was a agreeable argument that aliens were never on mars and proably will never be again.  ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The Face is a natural landform because while the first picture was bluried the second was ten times sharper then the original, the photos are reported to be of a natural landform, scientist say it is a mesa (common in the western U.S).

As I stated before, scientist say the second photo is ten times sharper than the original photo. This means it was more accurate. The article showed the second picture to readers at the top third picture to the right. It shows what looks like, and is ,a natural landform. One scientist, Jim Garvin, compared it to a mesa.

In conclusion, the Face is an all natural landform that formed on Mars. I said that it's natural because the photos (which are more accurate than before) are said to have a picture of an natural landform, which they do. The Face can't be a Martian relic as it is a mesa. If it was of Martian descent wouldn't it look more noticable and detailed? The Face is a natural landform because the first picture shown to the masses was bluried and unaccurate while the second was sharper and more accurate than the original, the second photos are reported to show a natural landform, and scientist say the Face is a landform not unsimilar to a mesa (which can be found in Western America).",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

In the article they bring up reasons to believe that is is a natural rock formation instead of an alien, yet there are still people who believe that it is an alien.

In the article when the author starts talking about the Face on Mars they give many reasons as to why the Face is a natural landform. One way you know that the Face is a natural landform is because 18 years after the original picture was taken NASA went back and took newer pictures that showed that it looked as if it was just a big boulder on Mars. In the article it states, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.... revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This shows that the Face was just one or a couple of years, but it went away and is now shown as a flat rock surface. Another way you know that it is a natural landform is because in the article it says that when the original NASA picture was taken they captioned it saying that it was a rock formation. In the article it says, ""NASAs Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face....A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head'."" This explains that even though the people at NASA also thought that it looked like a face they still said that it was just a rock formation that happened to look like a human face.

There are many more reason to believe that the Face is a natural landform and there are really no reasons why someone should believe that the Face is still on Mars, but we aren't getting good enough pictures. In the article it mentions a lot that the Face on Mar is just a landform and that even though people have come to believe that it was an alien they really should believe that it is a landform because there are so many more reasons to belive that.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

019FE7DD2DF7,"Have you ever heard about the face on Mars' surface? People think that it could be aliens, but more people believe that it is just a mesa or a butte. The Viking 1 gathered the first pictures of the face ever. Many conspiracy theorists think that NASA knows that it is evidence of an ancient alien race. It still remains somewhat a mystery to people all over the internet.

The Viking one captured the first pictures of the face in history. It was searching for landing spot for it's sister ship. The mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab were surprised when it popped up on their monitors. The pictures surfaced on the internet a few days later. It was a great way to get people engaged in the attraction to Mars.

Although NASA and conspiracy theorists would be happy to discover that the face is evidence of an ancient alien race on Mars. The formation is probably just a mesa or a butte. They are both landforms common to the American West. Garvin commented'' It reminds me of a Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.''A lava dome that takes form of a mesa around t he same height as the one Mars.

If the face on mars was an alien artifact NASA would be famous for finding it.

Conspiracy theorists say that NASA is hiding the fact that the face is an alien artifact,but NASA would not be hiding the fact that it is from aliens if it were because it would benefit them a bunch. For example they could make a ton of money from the publicity of it being something alien. With the money they could fund even more projects like sending rovers to Mars to try and find out more about the face, and maybe they could even be able to get humans to Mars. It would get people interested in Mars and they would want more pictures and evidence of it being an alien artifact. That is why it would not make sence for NASA to tell people on the internet that the face is an something alien instead of just being a mesa or a butte.

In conclusion there is a lot more evidence that the face is a mesa or a butte other than an alien artifact. Even though conspiracy theorists are convinced they have proof of alien lifeform. Most evidence points to it being a landform, like a mesa or a butte. There is also not any logical reason for NASA to hide the idea that it is evidence of aliens if it were true. These are just a few of the reasons that I believe that it is just a landform and not any evidence of an alien lifeform. The rest of the internet should realize that it is not anything alien too.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
71CA8C7E2759,"Hello my name is Ben I am a scientist at NASA, I have been discussing the face on mars with someone who believes it was created by aliens. I have read the Article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", and I have gathered some information and in my opinion I think the face was created by natural causes and is a natural landform. Here are some of my reasons.

My first reason why i think it is a natural land form is because as stated in paragraph three of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" ""huge rock formatiom . . . which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.'' By saying this they say that the face is meerly an angle with odd shadows making the illusion of a human face.

My second reason is in paragraph 5 which states ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" By saying that the conspiracy theorists are completely controdicted and the NASA supporters are agreeing with them and saying yeah it would be good if there were actuallty life on mars and making it possative on their part.

My third reason is in Paragraph 7 which states that ""Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time."" The team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. And the photos revealed a natural land form, and there was no alien monument after all. This shows that at the time the lack of high-tech cameras and technology made the landform resemble a human face. But not everyone was satisfied.

Some may argue and say ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze. But NASA went back and took another look at Cydonia on a ""cloudless summer day"" with their absolute maximum resolution camera and captured an extraordinary photo. But the photo contained no alien life forms as stated in paragraph 11 ""So, if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyamids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

In conclusion the face on mars is really just a natural landform, and stated in paragraph 12 ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa--landforms common around the American West."" ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho."" said Garvin. Those are all of the reasons why i think the ""Face on Mars"" is actually just a natural landform.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
F8072F32F74A,"I would tell them that how could an alien do that if they have never seen a human. I would explain to them that its kind of hard to turn a rock into that, that is why i would think its natural. But since the rock looks like that it would attract attention to mars and it would make people want to pay and learn more about it. I would also say that thr face on mars has been in a few films,books,magazines,and radio tallk shows because when people found out about it it was a top/ very popular thing.

But things would be more truthful or realistic if there was some type of civilization,war,or history about people living there, like in the 700 B.C earlier and later than that. People that would believe in the aliens would want more info or proof. Talking to my scientist co-worker they want to keep going taking better picks so it looks better and so they see if there is any alien marks. But it is very hard for them to search and look for things like Cydonia for example. Its also very hard for them to take pictures of it when its winter because of the clouds and dust.

But in 2001 each images spans where 1.56 compared to 43 meters per pixels in the best 1976 viking photo. You can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size,so if there where any objects on the ground like houses,shacks,planes,water,aircraft, or anything else you would of been able to see it. But in a way the aliens could of been tiring to send a messages to earth to let them know it was life there. But if they continue with the pixels, and to make bettter pixels they would be able to see even more every time.

There are a ton of things on earth that look like something but its not its just natural (it just happen). So something like that could of happened on mars, but it would be kind of strange for something to happen like that to happen on a planet where the is ''no life'. But everyone has there own opinion on what they think but we can only leave it up to the scientist to figure it out a regular person mostly likely can't only the pros. Us scientist will be able to figure it out today,tommorow,next month,or even years from now but hopefully one day we will find out. In my opinion I think we will with the technology we have and the things that will still be invented and be released one day.

So there is no way to really prove if aliens are real or fake. They are most likely fake, because they haven't tried to reach earth in any way. But if they did they would come in some type of aircraft. The aliens whole entire world would be shock and scared. No one would know what to do,because no one would even think something like that would happen in this current generation. But it could happen whenever most likely when its least expected.

But in some part of the world some, or alot of people are preparing for this are always waiting for this to happen. People should always be prepared for anything rain,sleet,snow,tornado, or anything evrything. But if the aliens never knew about life in earth, and they decided to send aircraft to like we did if they saw a rock with a alien looking thing on it they would react like we did. They would keep sending taking more pictures, however they would look at it they would get curious and try to make a trip to earth not knowing that there is actual life there.

But if earth did the same thing it would be a problem its taking a huge risk. When they would arrive and look around if they saw aliens they would panic. The aliens would be stronger then them most likely they probably wouldn't be making a trip to home. The aliens would some what react like a dinosaur if the NASA people didn't move (but they would) they would't get attack. But if they did move they would,so tiring to have NASA to go to mars is very risky for NASA and the astronauts. So they could make a better attempt by sending a drone and going around the whole planet,but the drone cant do everything that a human can. So if there is a cave or a door only a human would be able to search it the correct way, plus the drone could easily brake down or fail.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
AD083E05BDC9,"Though some may argue that the Face is alien made I belive I can prove them wrong. There have been many theories many are just based on others opinions instead of actual facts. So, how can we the scientist be right well, it's simple you use research.

Though I am on the side that the Face is just a land formation I can start to see the theorists point. In the begging yes it was some what unclear. Because theorists gave reasons to belive we couldn't see only because it was a cloudy time as said in paragraph 8. Also, it's hard to forget or just drop something as big as this which lasted 25 years. The Face was a highlight to a dull world it gave some people reason to believe that we are not alone and that event sparked so many other theories. But, never the less these theorists certinally need to get a day job and just quite while their ahead.

Now, that we have delved into the side that most don't join. I'd like to talk about why the Face should just be forgoten. When Viking 1 had been sent up in May of 2001 we along with theorists were curious about what was found. But with careful examination we were able to see it was nothng out of the ordinary. In paragraph 3 we had described it as "" as a huge rock formation with shadow that gave th illusion of a human face. In which case meant we had nothing to hide although some beg to differ. But, with some still demanding we have a closer look we had finally agreed.

In our case it was not an easy as stated in paragraph 9 '' cydonia is not easy to target."" Nevertheless we had acomplished our task and gave the people what they wanted. We had even had the technology to show everthing that could be seen on there. And of cousre NASA is stil correct becausce nothing was found just a rock that looked like a face. To compare it we had said""

its is equivalnt to a mesa or the Middle Butte in the American west.""

In conclusion, I believe that I have shown enough evidence to put theorists in their place along with others, who belive the Face is alien made. Though we and many others would have loved\benefited from it it is now proven there are no

Egyptian style pryamids , airplanes on the ground, or even small shacks. So to wrap it all up I belive and have proven that the Face on mars is nothing and should just disapear.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
EAD04227D16B,"1976 Nasa took a photo of a landfill that looked like a human face. Later on though they discovered that the face was just a martian mesa, and that the shadows helped the mesa look like a face. It is not evidence to life on mars because , Martian mesa's are common around Cydonia, And on April 5th 1998 the surveyer took another picture of the face on mars, and the image was much more clearer and they could see that it was just a landform nothing more.

Martian mesa's are very common and can be found through out Mars. The only thing that helped it look like a face was, the shadows that the mesa made. The sun also cause the mesa to look like a face but when nasa took a closer and clearer photo of the mesa they found out it was just a simple rock formation that had very dark shadows making it to look like it had a nose, eyes, and mouth as the text states.

You see al it was just a landform there was no alien sculpture or anything like that, even though that would have been cool it just didn't happen.

AC588B53A805,"When you see this face like formation what do you think? Aliens, rocks, sand? Well if you thought any of those it would be rocks and sand. Some people actually beleived this was made by extra terrestrials on Mars but no it's not This is just a rock formation found by NASA who thought at first it might have been an extra terrestrail creation.

This is not an alien creation if it were there would be arms, legs, or maybe a body poking out of the sand and rocks. But if it is something we probably wont know for another century or a few decades. But if there is extra terrestrial life on Mars we won't know for a very long time. If aliens did create this then where are they, did they just leave Mars or get wiped out. If this was created by aliens they should still be on Mars or at least signs of them should still be there.

The face still kind of looks like a face in 2001 even though it show sand and maybe thats a little mountain. but it still oddly resembles a face. There might be other stuff like this on Mars in uninvestigated areas and maybe one or two have been made by aliens or other life. We found water on Mars so something had to have inhabitted Mars atr least once. Maybe mars was like Earth at one point in time and there was extra terrestrial life on Mars but something made them leave and made Mars just a floating sandy rock in space.

ED9BEDC624F6,"Face On Mars

Have you ever wondered if there was possibly other life forms out there, living on other planets? In 1976, NASA'S spacecraft ""Viking 1"" was circling Mars and taking photos. Suddenly, it spotted a form that almost looked like a human face. Some conspiracy theorists assume and consider it to be evidence of other life forms, while NASA knows it's just another landform on Mars. It's common to have forms like that around Cydonia, it's also proven that there is no alien monument at all, and the pictures actually show that it's a martian similar to land forms here on Earth. All the evidence NASA has brought upon us has proven that it is just another land form on Mars.

Firstly, it is common around Cydonia to have land forms as such. NASA

has taken plenty of pictures of Mars to know that it's quite common for there to be land forms like this. Although it may have unusual shadows, NASA could only wish that there would be possible evidence of ancient civilization on Mars. It being common, creates a slimmer chance of it being crafted by other life forms.

However, when Mars Global surveyor in April 5, 1998, Michael Malin was able to snap pictures with his Mars Orbiter Camera team. These pictures were much more clear. When the image was first revealed on a JPL web site, they realized it was only a natural landform. There was no alien monument to be seen. This strong evidence shows that with a clear image, there is no sign of any alien monument.

Furthermore, the pictures show that it's a Martian equal to a butte or mesa lanforms, seen around the American West. This evidence clearly shows that it's related to Earth land forms like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho. This Earth landform is only a lava dome. The height is similar to the height to the face on Mars. These landforms being equal, show that it's normal to have land forms such as the Face on Mars.

But, perhaps the alien markings were hidden by haze, and there could be possible evidence that aliens are indeed out there. Maybe a closer look into the image would clearify these statements. However, as likely as it sounds, the pictures taken were accurate, with an advanced camera.

Nevertheless, the chances of this Face on Mars being created by aliens is proven false. NASA

may hope that someday they might discover evidence of other life forms. Until then, they have supporting explanations on why it's not. For it to be common to have land forms like the Face on Mars, gives enough clearification. As well as, there being no alien monument at all, and the pictures actually showing a land form similar to ones on Earth. We never know what the future holds, so will NASA ever discover facts that support the conclusion of there being life on other planets?    ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
5E13DB8C700E,"They have many things that show that the landform is natrual. One reason that the landform could be real is by pointing out that back then the cameras were not as good with quality so the camera could make it look like that. Another reason could also br the weather in that time the weather could have a big part in the way it looks.

The angel of the camera could also make a big diffrence in the look of it. the angel of the light that was ln it also could mae the changed because it was the shadow that made the landform look like a human head. Back then the pixels of the photo were 43 meters compared to now which is 1.56 meters. The clouds could also change the look.

NASA took photos of the supposibly face with a high-definition camera, that was more powerful then the one Viking 1 had. The face is just a lava dome that takes the form of a landform. If there was a airplane, hut, or a Egyptian-style pyramid we would be able to see it with no problem, and be able to make out what it is.

567BB29B602B,"If you want to believe that the face on Mars was created by aliens, that is fine, but we have evidence that it was not. The reason behind this is that like a lot of parts of Earth, it all naturally happened. Even if we find a clearer picture we have comfirmed in 2001 that it was just another natural landform And in the more clear picture, this face is the same as buttes or mesas commonly fond in the American West.

As we have been looking for more evidence we have gotten clear picture one after one, just to show that there was nothing left behind from aliens at the time. That was just the beginning. If we really have found a ancient artifact, then we would have started collecting small bits and pieces to examin them. Now, lets say that we did find that aliens created these lanndforms. We probably would have let more pictures to be seen to show proof of what we found.

Yes, there was also a thing during our winter where that everything on Mars is also hazy so that could be why we have been left to conclusion that it just naturally happened. However, if the monument gets abandoned every once in awhile then there could tools and items left back at it. If a landform was man made or in this case alien made, then there would be mistakes made, changes every once time.

As in an article that was read not that long ago, Jim Garvin says that the face on Mars looks about the same height as a Middle Butte in Snake River Idaho. This means that it was no matter what others say, it is just a natural landform that has just happened to look like a face. As from what Garvin said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

For that being so, the face is not an alien monument. The landform just has happened to be there and look like some face. Which if you still want to believe in the fact it could an alien thing that is fine. We have no alien evidence at all. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

B9A6F8B12366,"My fellow scientist thinks that there is life on Mars because of the ""human face"" that was found on Mars in 1976, but I can give him three reasons why there isn't any life on Mars and that the Face of Mars is just a natural landform. One reason is that the ""face"", based on the 2001 photo, looks a lot like landforms on Earth. My second reason is that if there was any chance that there was life on Mars NASA would keep it to themselves. My final reason is that Cydonia has many other known mesas, why would this one be special?

In 1976 and 1998 I do admit it does look a little bit like a face, but in 2001, with the better graphics, the ""face"" looks nothing like a face. In 1976 it was very popular because it made people believe in life on Mars, but with the enhanced graphics the popularity of this ""face"" went down because people started realizing that it was not a face. Also, it looks almost the exact same as the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

If this ""face"" was made by aliens, NASA would more than likely keep it to themselves. If NASA were to tell this to the public saying that it was an extraterrestrial made landform, the whole entire world would freak out. They would most likely be terrified of the aliens. Another reason is since the United States' NASA found this they wouldn't want other countries to know about this, so we could be the ones to discover life on Mars beforwe the rest of the world.

In the region of Cydonia on Mars, there are a lot of other mesas and buttes. Why would this one be any different? If Martians made a mesa that looks like a face, why would they put it around other mesas. They would most likely put in a region that doesn't draw attention to keep there life a secret.

In conclusion, the ""face"" on Mars is just a natural landform because it looks like landforms on Earth, Cydonia has a lot more known mesas, so this is another of its many mesas, and last but not least, NASA would never tell the world that there is extraterrestrial life on Mars.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Judging by the ways the conspiacy theorists said it might be an evidence that life exists on Mars, and saying NASA is hiding it is just wrong. The theorists still don't have enough evidence to prove it is a real life face, and that it was created by aliens. NASA actually does research, not them (using fake facts), and that NASA would never do such a thing.

Yes, the face did appear on television, books, magazines, a movie, and haunted a checkout line for 25 years, but this doesn't mean it is a real face. The later photos (1998, 2001) would look different than the 1976 one because it (the mesa) changed too much, and that it was revealed in a JPL web site in 1998 that it was indeed a natural landform, and it reminded fellow Chief Scientist Jim Garvin of a natural butte that takes the shape of a lava dome in the Snake River Plain in Idaho.

In 1976, in the mission control room, the scientists founded something eerie on Mars, there was a human face on it! Many scientists said that it was just a Martian mesa, but many people still stuck to their primal thoughts instead of the scientists' well-educated minds. Scientists stated that the face was just founded out that it's just a mesa. Also, Earth have a similar structure as the ""Face"". And finally, if scientists discovered extraterrestrial life on Mars, what will prevent them from talking about the upcoming major event in scientific history. Many conspiracy theorists may state that this ""Face"" is a clear evidence that there are life on Mars. But how could there be life on Mars just judging that there is a landform that looks like a face? Therefore, this states that Mars don't hold life.

In Mars, there are many landmarks, canyon, mountains, and, of course, mesa. Life on Mars would be impossible due to harsh weather going down below freezing, and absence of liquid form of water. Then how could a creature make a monument that is two miles long without getting burned, frozen, or starve? With these harsh environment we can conclude that nothing can create this except that it got created naturally. With these reasons, we can conclude that this ""Face"" cannot get created by extraterrestrial lives.

Furthermore, Earth also have similar landforms as Mars. In the Western America, there are hundreds of butte or mesa. Mesa is a structrue that consists of elevated area with a flat top. Scientists say that the ""Face"" is just a mesa. In fact, a lava dome mesa that have similar quality with the ""Face"" that is located on Mars. Also, human brain is linked to analyzing faces. When you go to a sightseeing area, you may see some rocks that are shaped interesting, or during your way to work, you may see many non-human objects that looks like a face. So how could a structure that is present on Earth be a proof that life exists on Mars? In conclusion, Mars cannot hold life that many peoples believe.

And finally, scientist would not keep a vital discovery as a secret. Many space-related articles state that discovering life outside of Earth would be recorded as a major event in history. And if a scientist discover an alien, then he or she would be rewarded tremendously. Will anybody tries to prevent this ""once in a lifetime opportunity"" probably not. Also, scientists would be delighted for an advance in technology, they would not leave the aliens alone, they would attempt a communication to the aliens and try to learn many things about their life. Consequently, this shows that aliens don't exist in Mars.

Some may say that the ""Face"" is a clear example to show the life on Mars, and that these creatures created this landform as a sign or as an art. However, with art or sign, they would live near the structure, but there are no sign of a life around the area. Also, it is not reasonable to believe what the conspiracy theorists are stating. They do not have clear evidence, they are just following their primal thoughts like a primitive life. Clearly, it is not wise to believe the conspiracy theorists over the scientists in NASA.

All in all, this proves that life cannot survive on Mars. The ""Face"" is proven to be a mesa that is common on Mars. Also, there are similar landforms in Earth called as the lava dome mesa that have very similar properties with the ""Face. And finally, scientists would not attempt to keep this amazing discovery as a secret on their own but share with the world instead. It is unwise to trust yourself and not the others to make you well informed and educated.

8892A2EB9E0C,"In 1976 a mars global surveyor image from 1998, and the latest MGS image from 2001. Twenty five years ago a ""human face"" was photographed on Mars. NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was trying to photograph possible landing area for the Viking 1 spacecraft's siter, Viking 2. When they were capturing photos they came across a face. Now you're saying that it was created by aliens.

If it was formed by aliens, Where did the aliens go? Where did they come from? How do you know for sure that aliens exist there has been no sightings of ""Aliens"". Nothing can live on Mars. If so why are they not still there.

It was a Martian mesa, common enough around Cyndonia, it only had ONE unusual shadow. No more than one unusual form. We had researchers, we also had all the right rescources to figure it was only a Martian mesa. Where is your evidence that it was aliens.

It was just a landform that was formed on Mars. They only sent it out to attract attention to NASA. When it did it got way to out of control. The article also said that ""the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds"". If a high tech camera can't see through clouds then how could ""Aliens"" see through it.

The landform was equivalent of a butte or mesa, those are landforms common around the American West. If it wan't a common landform then maybe I would believe you.

It was not ""aliens"" sorry to dissapoint you. If you could please have more research next time, that would be great. Evidence is apart of what we do here at NASA.               ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
4A8B8527DD14,"You may think that the face on mars was created by aliens and we say it isn't it's a natural landform sorta like some natural landforms on Earth like the Grand Canyon it's a natural landform but we can't actually prve the the face is a landform but we have a spacecraft named Viking 1 and 2 that has taken pictures of it so we can see if it was formed by aliens or if it is just a natural landform.

Here is how we think that it is a natural landform, as it says in the article ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, se if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""and it also says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.

Even though we think it is natural landform you guys think that aliens have made it and your point is as it says in the article ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.""

So as it says in the article ""It's not easy to target Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips we just don't pass over the face ver often.""

In conclusion even though the alien thing has a good point the pictures that Viking 1 and 2 got show that there are no alien markings and it is probably just a natural landform like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho or the Grand Canyon.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
67B143000AE2,"Mars has been a planet that we have been exploring for many years. We have discovered many abnormal objects on the planet. In 1976, we took a picture of the region Cydonia, and we found something that seemed to look like a human face. Our eyes are adapted to recognizing faces and that is why we recognized the face on Mars more easily. Higher quality images that were taken in 2001 show that the face on Mars is no sign of ancient civilization on Mars but in fact a mesa. It is a natural landform just like it would be on our home planet of Earth. Although some conspiracy theorists say differently, and think that is some sort of ancient civilization building these objects.

First off, the cameras that we have today are more advanced than the ones we had. The first picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken in 1976 and the quality back then was not as good as it is now. The picture that was taken in 2001 was a higher quality picture and scientists figured out that is was just a mesa and not a sign of any ancient civilization on Mars. For example the camera used in 1976, spanned 43 meters compared to the camera NASA used in 2001 spanned 1.56 meters. In the picture of 1976, the shadows that were present that day formed an illusion that made it seem like there was a face. In paragraph two of the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says that, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

Another thing is that, Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist from NASA's Mars Exploration Program, compared the Martian mesa to natural landforms that occur here on Earth. In paragraph 12, Garvin said, "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about thye sane height as the Face on Mars."" Jim Garvin is saying that these formations on Mars are very similar to the ones that we have here on Earth. He is also saying that there os no face on Mars.

In contrast, conspiracy theorists say that there is a face on Mars and that there is ancient civilization on Mars. In paragraph 8, it says that, "" The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings we hidden by haze."" Conspiracy theorists also state that NASA would rather hide the evidence that there is an ancient civilization on Mars, as it says in paragraph 5. Also stated in paragraph 5, is that the defenders of NASA wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

The face has been a pop icon ever since the discovery of the formation. the face will always be a piece of history and will always been known to man. If there was an actual face on Mars then that would be a sign of life. The face ended up eing a mesa and nothing else besides that. Although it would have been an exciting discovery for NASA, we still have much more of space that is unknown and unexplored. NASA is bound to find some kind of incredible object. We will have to wait until that day comes and find something incredible and will be part of the incredible true story of space.                             ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
5F5BFA00EFBE,"I am a scientist at NASA, and I am going to prove to you that NASA was not created by aliens, it is just a natural landform. Other scientists, including me was around Mars taking photos. We took a lot of photos and when we came back to check the photos it looked like a human face. I used a new method step by step to see if it actually was a human face, but it was not. It turned out to be a rock shaped as a head, and the rock made you have an illusion of the eyes, mouth, and nose.

To many people are concerned about aliens going to attack, but it is not true. Some scientists just want you to think there are aliens that based off what they have saw. If you look on a JPL web site you can see that it is just a natural landform. After all there was no alien monument. The picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms.

According to what the theory is, another reason for it being a natural landform is because NASA would rather hide and the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Half of the time on photos things start to look like ghost or even aliens for this matter if you are scared and are thinking about aliens being alive or by you. The Face is a natural landform according to the mission controllers, where the lab is. Monitors will lok like a face when you first take it but you have to clear the picture up a little bit.

For the Face to seem natural to you, you have to believe that there is no aliens out on what people call bona fide, of life on Mars. You always want to make sure that you are not just having an illusion. To make sure you are not having an illusion you are checking what ever is happening twice. For an example of a natural landform, there would have to be pictures taken and on the natural landform there would have to be a mapping spacecraft and that normally looks straight down. For an example of a alien landform, there would be UFO's with bright lights shining and would have to have a hide out for them to live and to not be seen.

This is my evidence that I gathered from the method that I used to prove to you that the Face is just a natural landform. Yes, NASA does have a Mars but, that does not mean that there would be aliens, just because it says Mars. If you ever have need some help on getting a person to believe you about something like scientists wise, come to my website JPL and message me. Their are creatures but they are not on the Face of NASA. Do not ever forget if you take a picture and you think something is there try to clear it up or get someone else to clear it up.

A big idea is that a face has been put on Mars from another life form. It? a rediculous thought with many people such as me shaking their heads at the crazy theroy. There is no way the another life form could put this face on Mars. It? just a cool natural landform that ironicly looks like a face.

Their are many different planets with many different natural landforms on them. Mars just happens to have one of the most interesting natrual landforms however. The face as people call it, is a huge rock formation that gives us an illusion of a face. Humans have claimed that Aliens have put this massive rock formation on there, but from a scientific side their is not a single piece of evidence suggesting that Aliens are real.

Yes, the face is quite mysterious, but their are plenty of queer landforms on every planet. The media is a place that has taken ¨The Face¨ and it has made it out to seem like Aliens have made it to scare us. I can understand why one who has no sceintific background might believe this, but these landforms can occur any where on any planet over a peroid of time.

As a scientist if you belive something you try and prove it. With the discovery of the face and people skeptic of the aliens scientist? launched a spacecraft into space to see if it could find anything. Nothing. No housing systems, no monuments, no building structures of any sorts, and most importantly no life of any sorts. Mars has harsh living conditions so to find any sort of life would be crazy enough, especially aliens!

The face is just another one of those amazing natural landforms that space has given us. It amazes me and others what things can happen in space. There are for sure no Aliens in space, however. All of the evidence proves to the fact that there is nothing on Mars or in space that could build something. Who knows maybe in a million of years space could amaze us even more with another landform similar to ¨The Face¨.

A16CBD1B02FC,"Twenty five years ago, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars. While snapping photos of possible landing sites, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. The head is nearly two miles from end to end and seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. This head formation is just a natural landform on Mars. On the otherhand, some people think that NASA would rather hide the fact that it could be life on Mars, say conspiracy theorists.

The face on Mars is a natural land form. The article states that, ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" This shows that pictures would be taken to prove that the landform is indeed a natrual landform. The text also states that, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the face first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This peice of text shows proves that with the pictures, the head is a natural landform. These text peices show that the face is a natural landform on Mars.

The land formation on Mars is was not created by aliens. The article states that, ""On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. 'We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, Mailin's team an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.""

These text peices show that the pictures would have caught any signs of alien incounters so these prove that the natrual landform on Mars was not created by aliens.

Some say that the face has been created by aliens and that it is not a natural landform. The article states that, ""But not everyone was satisfied.

These text peices show that since it was a cloudy time, the alien markings weren't revealed which makes them believe that the face was created by aliens. However, new pictures were taken and shows that if there was alien markings, they would have been noticed which goes to show that the face is a natural landform.

In conclusion, 25 years ago, a face had been seen on Mars by pictures from the Vinking that is a natural landform and looks similar to a human face.

There have been many claims of extraterestrial life forms on Mars. Most of these claims lack evidence. There may still be life on Mars, but we have yet to gather any real evidence. I assure you that the Face is nothing more than a natural landform that shadows had an effect on to make it appear to resemble a monument.

The face had bumps on it that created shadows to make it seem like there were human features on the mesa. The 2001 picture shows this very well you can see multiple bumps and lowered areas creating shadows. Compared to the others you would still thing aliens created it.

Three pictures accurately represent the mesa for the technology used. For 1976 it looks like a face but they could only get this as the best shot for thier time. In 1998 the picture is much more clear and you are able to see exactly what it is but with some doudt because it was cloudy that day.

To assume simply because a rock formation looks like a face that it is an alien artifact is illogical. Martian mesa's are infact very common where the Face of Mars was discovered. It just happened that one of them happened to have weird shadows that made it appear to be a face.

In 1976, the quality of the cameras that took the first photo of the Face of Mars on the Viking 1 were inadequate. On the Viking 1 photo, every pixel was 43 meters, meaning the photo would be very distorted. In 1998, it was taken again with a better, yet still not great, camera that would reveal the rock formation merely only looks like a face because of the weird shadow. In 2001, the photo was taken by a MGS with a good quality camera. The camera on this MGS had quality of 1.56 meters per pixel. Meaning if there were structures or a Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you would be able to see it. This proves that the rock formation was not created by aliens.

The martian mesa is very common in the region where the Face of Mars was found, yet Garvin says ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" He continues by saying ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars."" It can be proved that this is not an alien structure as, not only is it common in that region in mars, it is also common in Western America.

There is strong evidence that proves that this 'Face of Mars' is not an alien structure, and instead simply a very common martian mesa that just happened to have shadows that made it appear to be a egyptian face. An alien structure on mars would be interesting, but I'm afraid this Face of Mars is not what it first appeared to be.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
8535C94E2AB6,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" a NASA air carft Viking 1 discovered a landformation that looked like a face but scientists proved that it's a mesa. Shadows from Marses clouds or from the atmoshpere could've formed the human like shadow. Theorists are saying that there is life on mars but don't have enough evidence from the article to prove so. NASA is wishing that there was evidence that there was life forms for the sake of their budget. These are some reasons that the conspiracy theorists are wrong.

When the Viking 1 took the photo of the mesa the maritian skies could've been cloudy,or the Viking's camera could've been foggy. Scientists have ruled out the idea that the picture could've been formed by some type of life form on mars. some scientists have concluded that the are is just another mesa. Which is common around Cydonia,but only with unusal shadows to form the human face. these are the reasons that scientists have ruled the area being a mesa.

Here are some more better reasons that prove that the picture from the article is just a mesa. On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin took a better photo of the mesa and uploaded it to a JPL website. But not everyone was satisfied with just this picture, the therorists were stills skeptical about the photo since it was still a little blurry. NASA's mission controller prepared to send another spacecraft to amrs for a better higher resolution photo. These are some better reaosn that scientists have ruled out that there is possible life form on mars.

NASA's misson contoller Garvin explains better reason on why the area is just a mesa and not a alien artifact. The photo that was taken in '98 was during the martiain winter,a cloudy time of the year. The cmaera on board the spacecraft had to peer through whispy clouds. On April 8, 2001 Mailn's team captured another photo of the area on a cloudless day on mars. The camera that Mallin's team used was at it's highest resolution so the picture couldnt be clearer. Garvin say's ""If there were objects in this picture like airplanes or Egyptian-style prymaids you would be able to see it!"", Garvins reasoning for this is because during 2001 if you where looking at the photo from a computer you could zoom in three times more to get a better quality picture.

In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" there have been theorists that have concluded that there is alien life form on mars,but only from a simple picture that was taken in 1976. Over the years scientists have been sneding spacecrafts to prove these theorists wrong,which they have. in 1998 sciencists sent a team under the leadership of Michael Mailn to take another photo of the mesa,once they captured the photo theorists still beleived that there was life form on mars. In 2001 NASA's misson controllers sent Mailn's team again to take another better photo during a cloud less day on mars. These are the reasons that the pictured caputed in the article is just a mesa not a alien artifact.",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The face on Mars is a mysterious object Mainly because how it resembles a human face from the first picture in 1976 but that picture is outdated. One of the most recent picture taken in 2001 shows that the ""face"" is actually just a landform that appears on Earth and it is common in the American West. This landform is that appears commonly on Earth is known as a mesa. If the face on Mars was proof of an ancient civilization on Mars NASA would have better funding than it allredy has and there would be more exploration on Mars.

Although the Face on Mars has become an icon in pop culture that dosen't change the fact that it is just a mesa and at that time the camera wasn't nearly as advanced as what we have now.

The combination of cameras that werent nearly as good as the cameras that we have now and the shadows that the image had on it made it look very similar to a human face when NASA first took a picture of the mesa. More current pictures show that what looks like a human face in one picture actually is an average land formation on our own planet. So in conclusion the Face on Mars is nothing more than a naturial land formation that can happen on Mars and Earth.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
36746D9B154A,"""The Face on Mars"". Many pepole think that its more than what it is. They think that we're hiding something. That maybe what we found was something that we didn't want you to know. However, I can assure you that if their was anything going on in the solar system, that we would tell you because, well thats our job. Our job is to analyze the solar system and keep the public informed on anything that is happening outside of earth that normal citizens couldn't see for themselves. If their was life or anything else on the moon of Mars we would have seen it by now. Also, we would benefit from their being something special about the moon of Mars. Another thing believe it or not we wouldn't keep something that could change the way that we live to ourselves.

We would have seen something extrodinary by now. The picture that was taken in April of 2001 would have shown you anything else that sat nearby ""The Face"". Also in an earlier picture they determined that the mouth, nose, and eyes on ""The Face"" were shadows. They were not built into a structure the way that they would have been if indeed the structure was built by other forms of life. This also just popped up, if say someone or somethign did build it then it would have progressed. It wouldn't have just came to in one of our pictures. However, if say an asteroid had hit the planet, then it could have caused the same thing that had happened here.

On another note, anyone that knows anything about NASA knows that we get funding from the government. When we get funded from the government obviously they need people to check things out. The people that check things out are obviously going to get paid because that is their job. So if we're going to get paid more and more money to try to find life on the moon of mars then why wouldn't we want their to be life on the moon. The funding that NASA gets isn't little. Some people would have the oppertunity to make allot of money. It would also give NASA a chance to get people interested in what they do for a living.

The whole point of our jobs is to go to school to learn how to see things that happen in space beyond what we already know. We want to help and make a difference and keep people informed on what else is out there. So if we found something again we would want you all to know about it because we could teach you something. So many people think that our job is stupid and useless because all we do is stare at the stars. This would be a good way to show everyone that what we do is real. We really do see things that the rest of the world didn't know about. Most kids don't want to be an astronomer anymore they want to be doctors or lawyers. So showing them that what we do is important would be a good thing for the kids. We alll want whats good for the kids so why wouldn't we tell them?

Life on the moon of Mars. It sounds plausable. It sounds amazing. So many good things could come from the fact that there is life on mars that it is unreal. However I can assure you that there is nothing there. ""The Face on Mars"", it's just a natural land formation that we took a picture of over the years. Nothing more , nothing less.

86ECDA1AC91E,"The face on the moon is just a rock that gives an illusion to the human eye. The face had become popular and eveyone was talking about it. It appeared on Hollywood films, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even the haunted grocery store for 25 years.

The face is on the planet Mars and other people thought it was a face of an alien of some kind. They thought that because it looked like it had a nose,pair of eyes, and a mouth. The first picture of the face on mars was in 1976 which is called the Viking photo. The second was taken by Mars Global surveyor (MGS) form 1998. Finally, the third image was the latest image from MGS in 2001.

A few scientists believed it was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when Mars MGS arrived at the Red Planet inseptember 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. April 5,1998 MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter April '98, a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. It reminds Jim Garvin most of Middle Butte in the Snake River. The Face on Mars became very popular and showed on many events like the television, newspaper articles, books, and the checkout area in grocery stores for 25 years.

422B54DC6821,"The Face is nothing more than just some landmark. Sure, it may have looked like a face in 1976 but now we have better technology to study it. From what we have found, its just a landmark, you're a scientist, not a conspirasist. You are just believing what you want to beleive, and what you believe has no scientific evidence.

When the mesa looked most like a face was in 1976, that was over 20 years ago. Technolgy has advance since 1976, I mean look at what we have now compared to back then. The NEWER photos from the NEWER peice of technology, the Mars Global Surveyor, has taken better photos of the mesa. That's right: a mesa.

Even when you get disproved, you try to argue about it, now you're just arguing from a point of ignorance. Gavin said, and i quote, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the sameheight as the Face on Mars.""

In conclusion, there is no face on Mars, just a mesa. You are arguing from a point of ignorance because anything you can be shot down almost immedently. Technology has advanced to meaning that we can get a better look at the mesa. So just look at the facts, and stop believing everything you hear. You're a scientist for crying out loud, act like one.           ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
A79BE7C6D5F9,"We are all human beings. We all have some different opinions and some same opinions. The interesting debate was about the Face on Mars. I am here to tell you that the Face is just a natural landform.

I have reasons to why the Face is just a natural landform. First, aliens are not scientificly proven to be real. Therefore, the Face could not have been an alien artifact. Second, the face appear that a person is inside the moon trying to come out and that is impossible for someone to be inside the moon. Finally, no one could have been to Mars and created that Face because it would be stated on the Internet on who created it.

There are numberous of evidence of why the Face is just a natural landform. First, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the original Viking photos revealing it as a natural landoform. In addition, the camera that Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo of using the camer's absolute maximum resolution. Futhermore, each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compare to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Finally, the picture that Malin's team capture showed that it is Martina's equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

Others say that the Face on Mars was not a Martian's equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms. Some people believed that it was from an alien artiface. Others like conspiracy theorists said the evidence that NASA would rather hide.

There are reason why the Face on Mars was just a natural landform. This eassy helps you to rethink your thoughts of what it really is. There are logoical supports and evidence. The Mars is an interesting place for a planet.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
183D9912EF76,"The Face on Mars is just a natral landform. Why i say that because, aliens are not real and they can't create the landforms that were seen. If there where aliens then it would been more information found on NASA. If no human or thing cant't breath in space a alien shouldn't be able to breath there either. There would have been extra evidence found in space if there was a alien seen.

Evedence was found that on the monitor a face apeared on it. But a few days later NASA unveild the image for all to see. The caption noted a ''huge rock formation . . . whitch resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'' a NASA scientist added. '' so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!''

Personally i think there are no such thing is aliens but if they were there would be alot done to earth and landforms. The NASA scientist has done a great job on taking the picture of the artifact.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
E6F348103B15,"The ""Face on Mars"" was just a natural landform. The ""Face on Mars"" was described at first as a ""Egyption Pharaoh"", when really it resembled the Middle Butte in the snake river plain of Idaho. If there were aliens who did make the monument, we would have not exposed this new information to the world, and have some scared, or excited about top secret information like this.

The natural landform must have been created by a shuttle landing,or has been here before we've known it. According to our team in NASA "" The picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle,or mesa"", as I have said at the beginning, also if the landform were to be created by aliens there would have been some type of physical evidence that something, or someone would have/had been there before us.

Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA explained "" We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it.""

meaning, as soon as there was a shot so our supporters could make out, the picture was sent in to them. But because our supporters were not as satisfied of the picture, and thought they were gonna have some type of sy-fy picture to show them, they were sadly mistaken. They also have to realize and understand that information exposed to the world like that would not only put them in jepeordy,but us and our jobs too.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
455C891CB795,"So all of this has been going on for awhile now on the news with all the gossip and rummors being spread its lead you to beleive there is life on mars. The question is is there really life on mars. The images shown from 1976 could eassily convince someone there is life on mars being that a single human has not ever been to mars before.

This dosn't necasarily mean anything though. Then they took an other picture of the so called face on mars in 1998 it came in clearer now becouse we had created new technolgy that lets us take better pictures. Then finally as techonolgy as we know it has become greater it takes better pictures now so in 2001 N.A.S.A took an other photo of the mysterios face. It turns out its not even a face it was just a land form.

With the new technology there was no dobt it was just a landform ""so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they are!"" As stated in paragraph 11. It is just a landform like land forms we have on our planet we have the grand canyon for instance it just so happens mars has some landforms of its own and it just happens to be a landform clasified as a mesa landform common in part of the american west. So dont let hollywood get to you with there myths and spooky tales the real evidence prooves its just a land form.

It is fun though to dream of it as a sing there is other life beyond us but for right now it is just a landform on mars. If your still not conviced let me explain more the reason that we had not came across the landform as soon as we had discovered mars is becouse we don't cover that area that often but it is shurley not aliens. Look at the time capsale at the beginning of the arcticle from 1976 to 2001 it clarifies more so you can see the image better it just is a peice of land perhaps the image that was taken was just clouds casting a shadow that made it apear as a face. I hope i have cleared any thoughts you have had other wise about this so now yo know it is just a simple lanform that was once dreamed as a face.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
B9653E66970E,"Just A Natural Landform..

The image shown in the capturing photos brought back from Mars revealed something, some call an alien, and others call a natural landform. The image seemed to have caught everyone's attention. As mentioned in the article, it has starred in Hollywood films, magazines, been heard on radio talk shows, and has appeared in books. The images seemed to have reminded people of other natural formations, looking like a natural landform.

Many things like this seem to remind people of other natural formations. Paragraph 12, from the exerpt, states ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Gavin. ""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" Gavin, like many others thought this formation looked like other natural landforms.

The face is just a natural form. Paragraph seven from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" also stated ""There was no alien monument after all."" The same paragraph also included ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were wating when the image first appeared on a JPL web site revealing... a natural landform.""

I can see why many people would think the natural formation looked much like an alien because, as included in the exerpt, it looked like a shadowy likeness of a human face. However, it looked like it was a huge rock formation with a human head formed by shawdows.

The images captured were just revealing a natural formed, that looked like some other natural forms found all other the world. As stated in the article, ""The face is just a natural form.""     ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
06836C5C3838,"I believe the Face on Mars is actually a natural landform. Even though the face does resemble something created by aliens, I still think that it is natural. I will show you why I believe that this is just a landform, and not a face created by aliens.

I believe the Face is a natural landform because scientists believe that the face resembles landforms around the American West. One scientist said that it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Also, the scientist added that its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face.

Scientists can be wrong sometimes though. However, scientists work on their research really hard, so I believe that they know what are doing and seeing. For example, scientists say that you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so we can see what the face is, a natural butte or mesa.

In the article, it states that on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped a photo ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image revealed that the face was just a landform, and no alien monument at all. The monument does look like aliens made it, but this fact just shows that the Face is fake and is actually is indeed a mesa.

This tells you why I believe that the Face is fake and is actually a basic landform. Even though the Face does look like aliens made it, it is more likely that it is a natural land form. These facts prove that the Face is not alien made.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
32D988FC1AA1,"Imagine, scrolling through google just like you do everyday, and finding something you could only remember as a nightmare from your childhood. Well that may have been the case for some. In 1976, photos from NASA were leaked around the world, revealing a strange face on the face of Mars. But is that reaally what it was?

When scientists saw this formation, they to were astounished. Most just believed it was a martian messa, but few didn't. They believed there was truly acient life on Mars. Messa's were very common in Cydonia, the place they found the landform. So that was what it was expected to be, but there were still skeptics.

People from around the world believed NASA wanted to hide something. That they didn't want anyone knowing there really was life on Mars. But why would NASA want to hide something so extrordinary? Not to mention the fact they would get even more publicity and money spewing their way. But the people weren't satisfied, so NASA decided that in 1997, they would go back and capture more.

This would prove to be very difficult for NASA. The rotation of Mars would make it hard to actually land near Cydonia, but in 1998, they did it. The photograph was ten times sharper than the last from 1976. It showed that the formation, was just a formation. Not any ancient artifact. NASA took all that time to prove something that was already proven. Yet few people still were not satisfied.

The people argued that, because it was winter on Mars, it was to cloudy for the camera to take a proper photograph. They thought maybe alien markings were covered by haze. So NASA decided to set off one last time. On April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second picture, this time with even better cameras. It once again, showed for sure that the landform was nothing but a messa.

One scientist, Jim Garvin, Even compared it to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, trying to help the people understand. NASA whent through so much trouble to prove to the people that it was not life on Mars. So they eventually came to the conclusion that it was just a landform. But there will still always be skeptics.
