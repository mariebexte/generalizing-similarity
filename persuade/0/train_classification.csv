""Come over here quick!"" As I told my NASA crew members, I told them that I had found something. Hi i'm a scientist at NASA diccusing the face that another scientist thinks it was created by aliens. As i told them they all came and was wondering what I needed them for and if I found clues. ""I think I found parts of the face that is not an aliens."" states one of the scientist at NASA. We didn't find anything unusual, except that there may be more than one of the faces.

Many of the scientist are starting to wonder if this face was created by aliens. Scientists have tooked camera over and there is no alien monument after all, But how do you get the others to believe thats theres not. Not everyone was satisfied. The face on mars is located 41 degress north latitude. The camera they had been using had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. They said the aliens marks may have been hidden by haze but some didn't even think that their were aliens marking and said that it is just a natural landform, but then again how could they prove it.

April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time ever. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal photos. Many anxious web surfers were waiting for the first image to appear on their screens. All they got was a natural landform no sign of alien transformation.

Lastly, NASA had many images for web surfer to see. The caption that they had noted underneath was huge rock formation. Which is resembles a human head. It is formed by shadows giving the illusion of the eyes, nose and mouth. The authors reasoned that it would be a good way t engage and attract the public attentions to Mars.

What the picture was actually showing was the martian equivalent if a mesa or a landform. Which was common around the AMerican West. It reminds many people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idoho. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of a isolated mesa about the same size as the face on Mars.                                                   ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
BA9B801E3540,"The face you see in the photos is merely an illusion to you. The face is a huge rock formation which resembles a head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, mouth, nose, etc. There has been three photos taken of this rock formation since 1976, since the 1976 photo the camera resolution, meaning the focus of the camera, has improved. Since the resolution of these cameras have improved you can see clearly that there is not actually a face on the surface of Mars. It is just merely a large buldge of rocks.

The face you may have once saw is only a shadow of a rock formation. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet to look for its sister ships possible landing sight when they found the rock formation, then they snapped pictures of the rocks. Remember the camera resolution was not as clear in this time period.

Due to the scientific studies and the fact of the camera resolutions we have found that there is not an alien life force on the surface of Mars. The only thing we've found are rock formations. The most recent picture taken was at least tens times sharper than the ones before, revealing it is just a natural land form.  ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
3AAAB238F2C3,"When the face on Mars was first descovred from a region of the planet called Cydonia first found in 1976, many people thought it might have been created by aliens. However this is not true, the face on this planet is a natural landform. The face is a natural landform because it is equivalent to a Martian mesa, there were no ther objects seen in the picture, and there was no alien movement detected.

The face on Mars is a mesa. A Martian mesa is commen around the area of Cydonia. The mesa is only seen as a face because it has unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. The shadows give the rock formation the ilolusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa which are landforms common around the American West.

There were no other objects seen in any of the pictures that had been taken. Michael Malin's team captured an extraordinary picture using the camers's maximum resolution. ""As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"" Garvin explaned. So if there were any objects in this picture such as airplanes, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even a small shack it would have been seen in the pictures.

There was no alien movement detected on Mars. If it was aliens that created this face the camers's would have picked up the movement and captured pictures. On April 5, 1998 a Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The image revealed a natural landform proving there was no alien movement.

The Face on Mars is a natural landform that looks like a face becasue of the shadows it was formed by. The Face is a natural landform that was not created by aliens because it is equivelant to a Martiam mesa, there were no other objects seen in the picture, and there was no alien movement detected.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

This ""Face"" is just a land form wy can you guys not see that. It looks and has the same formations as the rock formation in Idaho. They both are the same hight and they both look alike. Don't forget that it looks alot like butte or mesa.

3B890907ED43,"The face on Mars is just a natural landform. Their's really no existense of aliens, because theres no proof of them. The face is just a landform that was created with Mars. On Earth we have landforms that look like faces and other things that were created with Earth. There's also no proof that there's life on Mars, becuase there really isn't life on Mars.

The existence of aliens is false, humans and animals are the only life forms out there pretty much. If there were proof of aliens then why arn't they on Earth then? Aliens never made that on Mars, that face was created when Mars was. NASA just used the face to get money, because this face was starred in a Hollywood film, it appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store check out lines for 25 years. Then after that they really didn't care for the face anymore. Everyone was not really satisfied with the face on Mars.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-- landforms common around the American West. Garvin a scientist even says that it reminds him of the most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He also says ""That's a lova dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

As you can see the face was never created or made by aliens. The face was created with mars. In the story, it even says that the landform was basically created with Mars. So in fact there is no existence of aliens and there is no life on Mars.

In the ending of the story, it basically says the face is just a landform, it tells the height and everything about it. They even say that they don't pass over the face that much anymore. So it's just a true fact that the face a landform, they even said it was just a natural land form.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
61C3ADEA1DD5,"The Face on Mars The Landform

Do you belive the Face on Mars is made by aliens? The Face on Mars is a landmass on planet Cydonia or Mars. I beleive that the face is just a natural land form.

The face was found around the 1990s by a ship named the Viking 1 in shearch for a possible landing sites for its sister ship the Viking 2. The face is about 2miles from end to end. A few days after scientists figured it was another Martian mesa NASA reveiled the photos to try to atract public atentin to Mars.

People got the wrong idea about the face they thought that the face was a ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars. the face was everywhere it appeared in a Hollywood film, in books, magazines, radio talk shows,and even haunted grocery stores. In September 1997 the Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program sent a [MGS] Mars Global Surveyor to take a pictuer of the face.

As I said befor I belive the face is just a landform on Mars. the mesa or butte forms on Earth to but Mars' land formations are larger that of Earth's in conclusen i hope this essay helped you see that the face is probaly just a landmark.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
760319CEF2E8,"Do you believe that the face on Mars is made by aliens? I know my opinion doesnt matter, what matters is whats real. I know you are also thinking that this is crazy, because we all know aliens do not exist. There is no proof of aliens.

It has to be a natural landform, because in the 12th paragraph Garvin said it reminded him of Most Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. Our universe can create anything, just because something look like it was made does not mean it is. There could of been rocks there, and the dust just blows around them. Making it look like it was made, by something or someone. The very most obvious thing is aliens do not exist, there has been no proof of alien. Even to this day in 2016 there is still no proof of aliens.

In the 3rd paragraph NASA even mentioned it as a ""huge rock formation"" scientist are very smart if there was other such thing that made it, it would have already been discovered. Also the face on Mars was a good way to get attention, like paragraph number 5 said so. The face of Mars turned into a famous pop icon. It was on Hollywood films, all the way to Haunted grocery store check out lines. If people could get the public to think that it was aliens that made the face, it would have maybe become way more popular. Plus most people do not believe in such thing as aliens, if they do not have real proof.

My very last example is , if NASA found out was aliens they would have already told the public. It would be huge for NASA to discover aleins. There is no way they would hide the proof that aliens are real. It would help their budget, if they did discover an ancient alien civilization on mars. As it says in paragraph 6 scientist started hunting for more information. It became a priority for them. All the pictures they took revealed it as a natural landformation as it says in paragraph 7.

There is no way it is related to Aliens. So if someone says that NASA is just hiding it, it would be false. NASA would surely reveal that there is aliens on another planet. Just imagine how much attention they would get if they actually discovered it. They would probably be one of the richest people. It is positive that a face on mars, made by aliens is not real. It is just a natural landform of rocks, that looks like a face. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
5667801661DF,"The face as you call it is just a natural land formation. We took pictures that prove us correct but you still think it was created by aliens. All we saw was that it was a mesa and that its shaddows look like a face. So why dont you belive us if you lok colsely at the 1998 picture you can clearly see no alien markings but yet you still belive why. Every body else belives us why cant you all you we see is a big rock so why do you think aliens put it there.

In the article it clearly states that the so called face was not made by aliens but just natural formations. There is no life what so ever on mars. It was not made by aliens but instead by mother nature. It was found in cydonia where a lot of other mesas located there and if that is not proof enough we sent three misions and they all reported it was a mesa nothing more nothing less. Unfortunatly some scientists belived it was an alien artifact so we took more pictures and the showed the exact same thing.

But we sent another mission to take pictures with more pixels and they showed no proof of alien life. But you still dont belive us and I dont understand why you dont belive us. even though we gave you all this proof you dont seem to care. What will it take to convince you that its not a face. If I were you i would have belived NASA as soon as they showed the picture.

But I am not you so

I will try to convince you. But if you reject the idea I will not care.

I will simply leave . So I will. continue when they told the public they even said it was a natural thing but still . the face is not really made by aliens but it is naturaly awsome. so i will leave telling you that you are wrong and that NASA is right. but the face is still cool and if it broke off and fell to earth it would be alien so food for thought.

164A6DA5E4E0,"25 years ago something hysterical happen around Mars.

NASA'S spacecraft called Viking 1 was circumnavigating the planet, snapping photos of possible landning sites for the other spacecraft viking 2.

When Viking 2 was found, it was a shadow likeness of a human face.

It was huge, its length was two miles from end to end. The caption noted it was huge rock formation, but it resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

That does not mean it was an alien, it just means that thats the way the natural landform formed.

The ""Face on Mars"" has been everywhere from Hollywood films to grocery store checkout lines for 25 years.

Very few scienists believe that he Face was an alien artifact, phtographing Cydonial became a priority for NASA and Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in Septemebr and the year of 1997, about eighteen long tirinig years after the Viking mission concluded.

It says in the story that the team which is called MOC snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Vikings photograph.

Thousands of peoples anxiety were coming out when they searched the web waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site revealing the answer.

The answer is a Natural landform, there was no alien monument after all.

On April 8, 2001 a war summer day in Cydonia.

Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.

""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,""

said Garvin.

Malin's crew captured and extraordinary image using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

Each pixel in he 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo.

But as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times better and bigger that pixel size.

So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they where.

The picture actually reveals that there is a martian equivalent of butte or mesa landforms common around the American West.",1,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
E28D7D67A8F7,"When Nasa discovered this ""face"", at first they didn't know what to say. So they just passed it as another ""Martian Mesa"". ""Scientist figured it was just another Martian Mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Eighteen years later after the Viking space trip, they decided to take more photos of it. The technology improved so it was giving them a clearer image. They got the pictures, and soon put them out for the public to see. ""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars"". Thousands of people that were waiting for this image soon saw it was just a landform, ""JPL website, revealing...a natural landform, There was no alien monument after all"". Then later they figured out that the picture was acually a butte or mesa. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, landforms common around the American West"".

6A70033E7F52,"Many people seem to believe that ""The Face on Mars"" is alien activity. However, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same heigh as the Face of Mars."" In that quote Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Explaration Program, states that he mainly recongnizes it from the land forms on Earth, rather than seeing it as alien actvity.

When the first picture was taken in 1976, technology was not as great as it is now or even in 2001. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared oto 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Meaning the qualtiy of picture taken in 1976, which convinced most people of alien, did not have great or even decent quality. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonis for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOS) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photo.

After taking the picture thousands of anxious we surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing.... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. When this statement was said not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April of '98-- a cloudy time of the year in the Red Planet. The camera in board had MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics alien markings are hidden in the haze. Which that is a resonable argument, but not being 100% postitive is too risky to throw into the public.

Garvin made an arguement that states, ""As a rule if thumb, you can descern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objests in this picture like airplans on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shack, you could see what they were!""

Using all of the evidence and arguments, and just by seeing the picture, it was just a strange occurence that a natural landform found on Mars was shape as a human face. Also the fact that the picture was taken about fourty years ago changes a lot. The amount and the quality of technology has changed tremendosely.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
3E875F22BACF,"Plan:A photo from 1998,is a pciture of a mask. So why they ""MGS"" claims is not a face? We don't,be we do know is that a high-resolution images and 3D altimetry takes picture from outer space. It says that ""NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet,snapping photo possible landing sites for it's sister ship"".

It also says, ""A few days later NASA unveilied the images for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth. So basically it tell the readers or the scientist thatat some point of time their was humans on ""Planet Mars"",and really they're trying to get them to realized just because its a""huge rock formation"" what if they'rereally humans skulls under all of the rocks?""The Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide,say conspriacy theorists. This shows that NASA was trying to keep it a sercet that theirs are head with a mouth,eyes,noes,and ears on Mars and they wasn't trying to put in no type of effort to get deeper in the situation or not even assummed is not normal for a planet that has nobody lived on and has a unusal head that just poped up out of nowhere on ""Planet Mars"".",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
DEA8B37D9FB0,"Now there hasnt been real information on the existence of aliens or any other lifeforms of that kind. Stories behind those creatures are usually made up by many people. We dont have any evidence as to seeing or taking pictures of any aliens or UFO's. So why would aliens be on Mars?

Due to the fact that researchers have identified that the ""Face"" is juast a mesa, I think is safe to say that there are no alien life forms on mars and there never was.

Nasa has very good cameras that are way better than the ones in 1976. They can zoom in way more and take 3-D images as well. if there were aliens living on there you would be able to see UFO's and a whole lot of aliens on the planet. And if there were Egyptioan style pyramids or even small shacks you would be able to see them to. The ""Face"" is a martian equivalent to a butte or mesa as scientifically proven by scientist.

Another reason as to why the mesa on mars is a landform and not some alien made artifact is that in the article it said that there were shadowns giving off the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. ""Its a good way to enage the public and attract attention to mars"", as said in the story. Also making the Face a pop icon also would make more people think that there really is life on mars without any real evidence. The face appeared on movies and magazines, which made more and more people follow this trend of life on mars.

The final reason as to why the object on mars is just a landform and not an alien made thing is that on a cloudy, wispy day, the photo was taken. Making it seem like the aliens did it on purpose. But, scientist took the photo again on a less cloudier day and found out that is was just a landfrom after all. when they shot it with their better camera, it showed that is was just made by mars just like earth makes its own lanforms sometimes. So it seems as though technology from back then just wasnt updated enough to get the job done.

Ultimately, the reason that evryone thought that there were life on mars is because technology wasnt as evolutionized as it was in 2001 compared to 1976. With the technology today, we would be able to find out right away if there were actually life on mars. So in conclusion, there is not life on mars and there never was.

A4D0859B9524,"In 1976, Viking 1, a spacecraft, was in search for its sister ship, Viking 2. When searching, they snapped photos of various Martian landmarks including what is now known as ""The Face on Mars."" They took this photo from an angle where it look as if a face was coming out of the ground. At first, NASA thought this might possibly be an artifact from Martian civilization, but were disappointed when they found it was just another landmark. Conspiracy theorists believed NASA was simply trying to hide the truth from them, but all of NASA's research proves the face is just an unusually shaped landmark.

Viking 1, the initial spacecraft to spot the landmark, didn't have the best technology. compared to today's technology, the picture would be considered blurry and out of focus. Yes, at first a few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, but instead of jumping to conclusions, they did more research. this meant another spacecraft would be sent to get better evidence.

On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor to get the better quality pictures to conclude their research. At this point in time, the technology had improved tremendously and the picture turned out ten times sharper than the first picture taken by Viking 1. This helped both scientists and some conspiracy theorists to understand it was simply just a landform. Still, there were some people who believed it was an artifact. They complained they took the picture during a cloudy time of year, and that this might have affected the picture quality.

Again, even though it was becoming quite an expensive mission for NASA, they returned to get another picture. On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor came close enough for a second look. The 2001 one picture was such a high-quality picture, it was said if there were any objects on the ground, they would easily be able to zoom in and identify what it was.

Releasing this to the public would benefit them more tahn if they hid it. The latest picture the spacecraft took of the landform proves that it simply IS only a landform.

A4ECC77D6EFE,"The ""face on mars"" is not a real face. The face is a mesa or butte that looks like the ones found in the American west. It looks like a face by the shadows that form on it. The camera that found the ""face on mars"" was old and later a new one took a picture that can clearly see the surface. The new camera cannot be argued with because it is the latest and clearest. Also why would NASA try to hide the fact that there was aliens on Mars when it would clearly benefit them alot.

The mesa or butte on mars is nothing but so. Saying that the government is hiding something like that kindof sounds dumb. If you think about it in the way i do it would be lke an alien race looks down on our planet saw a mesa that looked like a face and thought we knew he was there and wanted look at him/her/it.

Also dont you think NASA would have made a bigger deal about the ""face"" it was a real face. All in all the face just got blown out of proportion when it is just a rock.

If you are about to blame the camera and say it was the cameras fault and how it is a face and not a mesa you are wrong. First: NASA stated that they would take a better picture so why would they lie? Second: NASA would not spend all the money it took to get the spacecraft up in space to take a picture if it was not real. Third: if they did spend the money to get it up there why would they send a crappy camera? Fourth: NASA also stated they was going to wait for a clear day too so it is not clouds. The camera was fine, the weather was fine,and the image is completely real too.

If ther was really aliens on mars it would benefit them alot. Think about it why woul NASA lie about something helpful. If there were aliens on Mars NASA would get billions and billions of dollors to study them. Also if there were aliens why would we keep it a secret any way,because what if they had technolligy we didn't wouldnt we already have it? If there were aliens wouldnt they have already discovered us, so if they had bad intentions we would already be at war.

The ""face on mars"" is totally fake. Now that ive bestowed upon you my knowledge maybe you can pass it on to other conspiracy theorists. Then maybe the ""face on mars"" thing wil finally blow over.

Finding out how to survive on mars and the other planets is important and is something humans should learn how to do just in case if something happens to earth and we aren't able to go back to it.

NASA has studied this topic and has come to the conclusion that it is simply landforms. Now the question is what kind of land forms and how did they form?

NASA has been studying this topic since 1976 to 2001. Team Nasa has been reshearching and studying picturers and has come to the conclusion that the face is a landform.

NASA has studied pictures that are so high tech that if there was small shacks on the planet you could see it! This reshearch has been fun for team NASA.

EE84462914A3,"In the month of May, 2001 something strange and quite funny happened on the red planet, Mars. As NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the red planet, they snapped a picture of something that had the ""likeness of a human face."" Some people think the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens, but research has been showing, the face is only a natural landform.

On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time to see if they could get another shot of the ""Face"". Sure enough one man snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original photos from the Vikings. When the image appeared on a JPL website many were shocked to find it was only a natural landform, there was no alien monument after all.

After all the searching for more information on the ""Face on Mars"" scientists yet again in April of the year of 2001 drew close enough for another look! Michael Malin and his team captured an amazing, unbelievable photo using a camera with maximum resolution. When examining the photo, they found that the picture actually shows it is ""the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West.""

In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is only a natural landform and most certainly did not come from aliens. Thanks to the new and improved technology today, scientists were able to find out that the ""Face"" was only a landform which is even common on Earth. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
C620D8B8466B,"About twenty-five years ago, something happened around Mars. NASA, snapped photos of the object. On Mars, there is a face printed on the plant. People think it was created by aliens. NASA said it was created on it's own. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. Those are common around Cydonia. A couple of days later NASA saw a nose, eyes, and a mouth. Everyone belived it to be a face of an alien, but NASA said it's just a face on Mars.

The face on Mars has become a popular icon. It has starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines and more! Some people think the face is ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. The face, is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98.

Mission controllers prepared to look again. Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the plant like a fax machine. Thousand of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site. The pictures were revealing a natural landform. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, com[ared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 viking photo.

""As a rule of thumb, you can discern thinkgs in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"". In egyptia-style prramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were! There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Proupulsion Lab when the face apperared on their moniters. NASA, a few days later, unveiled the image for all to see. The authors thought it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.

ADDAB3785A00,"The Face on Mars is not what everyone thinks it is. Hollywood shows, magazines, and radio talk shows can exaggerate to make the landform sound like more than what it truly is. As a NASA scientist, I believe that you should know exactly what this historic landmark is, so you know the correct story for years to come.

First, you never know what publicity will do with the next big story. Media usually talks up the whole situation, to display the story bigger than it is. In this case, many people are under the impression that the landform is a face created by aliens, because of the media. Once a story is out in the public eye, people have different view points as well. ""Some people think the Face is bond fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This excerpt from the article states that many people believe that NASA is hiding something from the public, something that they don't want everyone to know about. However, NASA scientists, like myself, know that this is no extraterrestrial impression on the face of Mars, but rather a small mountain or hill that seems to resemble a face.

To back up what NASA has already said, you could easily have a prediction of what may have caused this mound to form. ""....landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin."" Garvin clearly gives us a connection that we can relate to. We don't all have the privilege to go into space, however we can understand what a landform like the Face may look like, if it is similar to a landform on Earth. Mountains, canyons, hills, or valleys are all form by different forces. The Face may have been formed by the winds on Mars, eroding away the rocks around it until there was a small hill left. Water could have possibly carved around the mound, leaving this landform. There are various, reasonable explanations for how this landform could have been formed.

In conclusion, the Face may be seen as multiple things to the public eye, but the experts at NASA know this landform is nothing more than a coincidence. This landform could have been formed by various causes, but it is merely a lucky chance that this mound would have the features resembling a human face. Although much talk may lead you to believe the Face is an alien creation, trust the expert scientists. The Face is nothing more than a normal landform on the face of Mars.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
0298ECE3D4C6,"Why do you believe the face was created by aliens? When looking at this image, you can think about that at first but if you believe it immediately, then there is something wrong about that. I will explain to you why the face was not created by aliens though i will also explain why someone may believe that.

The face is an image we found in 2001 that was taken by our Viking 1 spacecraft that was circling the Mars. The face is an area of land on Mars that has the illusion of a face. The illusion of the face comes from the shadows making the land look like it has a nose, eyes, and a mouth that resembles a human face. It was a surprise for most people here at NASA but we didn't believe it was alien works immediately because we didn't have any real evidence of it. It just so happened to be a patch of land that looked like a face.

We couldn't say it was made by aliens because we needed proof of that and we haven't studied Mars' enough to prove that aliens made the face. We know Mars is similar to Earth but it's still a different planet in our solar system. Although we hoped it might've been an alien civilization, we studied the face more and it was simply a landform similar to a mesa or butte of our world.

Even though we know it was just a landform, there are reasons we could see people saying it might've been made by aliens. We know Mars is able to sustain life because of it's conditions and there has been few deposits of water found there, but we have never found an actual living species on the planet itself. We as humans still don't know if aliens live on Mars or if aliens from other worlds exist at all. Many people believe there are aliens from other planets and some don't really care about the subject at all but it is possible that there's life on other planets.

Because we haven't figured out if Mars has life, people believe the strange and convinient findings on Mars (like the face) are works of alien beings. Although we have confirmed the face was not a work of aliens, we still don't know if aliens exist. We can conclude that the face is not the work of aliens but there just might be unearthly beings on our neighboring planet, Mars. Before we can confirm there are alien beings on Mars, we would need evidence to explain they do exist at all. But we can conclude, the face is not made by aliens.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Another example from the text that makes me believe that it wasn't made by aliens is that, ""People think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars,"" I believe this supports the claim that there is no proof of aliens because if there was then NASA would have already put in the papers so that could get money to go and explore Mars but, since they haven't put out any information about Mars obviously they haven't found anything to prove that there is life on Mars.

The second reason I believe that it was not aliens who made the face is because the astronauts might have just taken the photo when the shadows were in the right place. I believe this because the text states that, ""What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West,"" I believe this piece of evidence supports the claim because it proves that the shadows were only causing an illusion there was not eyes, or nose, or mouth they were only shadows that were in the right place. The second piece of evidence that I believe supports my claim is, ""

Scientists figured it was just another mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like and Egyptian Pharaoh,"" I believe this supports my because even the scientists believe that it was only shadows that made it look like the rock had eyes, nose, and a mouth.

After studying it, they took a picture of it, and they engaged the public with it.

The others are trying to protect it so NASA could be a little bit safer. The picture did look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. NASA said it was a ""huge rock information"" because it is very similar to a human's face. Next, you cannot just asumed the planet was made from aliens because there is a human's face on it.

After that, you got to be able to back up your answer , and saying why it is not a face. ""Thousands of anxious web sufers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform.""

People can asume it is a human's face because it look likes it. Another thing is that there is human's face on it, can mean life on the planet, Mars.

From what scientists have researched, they found many evidence to support their conclusion.

Some people do think it is the work of aliens, but many people have more resonable explanations.

That they can support from evidence they have either seen, watched, or heard about, that make it a valid explanation.

First off, scientists thought it could possible be just another Martian mesa, because they were common around Cydonia.

Most of all they wouldn't send pictures and information out to the public without being possitive about their discoveries.

Escpecialy if they knew how big of a pop icon it would turn out to be.

My reason that the ""face"" discovered in Mars is fake because the area where the ""face"" was discovored (Cydonia) has stroms their a lot and snow. So, there is a possibility that it was huge landform and the weather wore off the the landform to the point where it was a face.

As of right now we are trying to look at the ""face"" to look and conclude it is another Landform and not ""aliens"". we have also found that the landmass is the bottleneck of a volcano so maybe in a few years it will erupt and prove that it's not a face.

The landform on Mars is simply not a face or supernatural thing. This is just a mesa that has the resemblence of a face. Many say that it's evidence that supernatural beings actually exist on Mars but, there's simply not enough evidence to support that claim. Also it's a landform that can only be caused by natural/ geological changes. The so called 'face' can't be man-made (supernatural).

When picture were taken of the mesa, it was during the winter season on the planet. Also the Viking 1 was only able to take the picture with 43 meters per pixel. When scientist tried to snap the picture again in 1998 it was durin the winter season of the planet also and the camera had to cut through wispy clouds. So in 2001, on a clear summer day, the picure was finally taken. The difference with this photo and the one from 1976 is that the 2001 photo was taken with 1.56 meters per pixel whereas the 1976 picture was taken at 43 meters per pixel.

Now some people may say ' Well how come the 'face' is in that exact spot and it doesn't move ?' To be honest it would be the same as asking ' Why is Mount. Everest in the same spot and never moves ?' Now do you see the logic. The reason those landforms don't move is because the landforms were created by the planet ( Again not man or supernaturally made ).

Ultimalely, through advances in technology and knowledge about relating planets, this isn't a face on Mars. It is considered to be a natural made mesa. With the pictures taken, they had variables of why they looked how they looked, except the 2001 picture. Some cameras weren't as powerful as the pictures that were later taken.

I can see why people can believe its an actual face because it has the qualities of a face: eyes, mouth, and nose. Here are my reasons why this is definetly a landform.

First, there is no evidence of anyone going to Mars. "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" Mars has a very harsh climate and no one would even dare go off to a terrible, deserted planet to just not come back.

Secondly, there is no history of anything in space involving aliens and their artifacts. Many would say that the aliens didn't want us to knw they exist but the article states it could have been a person going to Mars. Scientists would have contacted the world and said we have evidence or living organisms on Mars.

Yet many people would believe living organisms on Mars and I can agree with that if they have fantastic reasoning to their theory. They might say that if someone went to Mars they coud have not brought back anything or they got stranded on Mars and that could have been their body. People may believe that anyone on Mars would not survive the deserted planet with harsh climate and they would surely die there. Some sort of creature may have made it and they would give us evidencce of life on Mars.

Revealing a natural landform there was no alien monument after all . But the other scienctist still was satisdied for what he belived in but as i was telling him that if there were some type of face or alien we could have seen by the picture we had tooken just as we could see if there were objects like ariplanes on the ground or even small shacks , you could see what they were.

553B7DD398EE,"I believe that the so called face on Mars is just a landform. One reason i believe this is because everytime we took a picture of the ""face"" it looked different. This is because the shadows are at different lengths throughout the day. It also looks different each time because the cameras where becoming more advanced and the images are having less and less pixels.

The reasons i believe that the landform on mars is a landform because shadows change how the object looks, the cameras were bad and were very pixelated making parts of the photograph look blurry, and mesas are very common in Cydonia. Like on Earth shadows can make objects look like something they aren't. Like I said mesas are very common in the area so there is a good chance that it is a mesa.

Because of this information thats supports the claim that the face is a mesa i believe that the claim is true. The technology over the time of taking the photos became more advanced therefore the cameras were able to take less pixelated images. When the last image was posted to a website in 2001 many of the people who thought the landform was a face or an alien artifact stopped believing. One scientist said that if there where buildings or aircraft on the surface that cameras would show if it was real or fake.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

On that fact if NASA did see any aliens on Mars they would have kept it top secret and wold have not showed the images to the world. Not saying its true but if NASA had shown an alien on Mars the world would freak out and we wold destroy each other.

Now tell me if you seen an alien on Mars what would you do?

All I am saying is in 1976 if aliens did make that face then why are we still here? Why haven't the aliens came yet ? Because if aliens were to make that face on Mars then that means they seen NASA's cameras circling their planet so they would've found a way to get them down. But I think it's a big pain in the butt to the people that think thier is alien life on a planet in our Solier System.

Now in days most people think that everything in space that might haved popped out is made by aliens but that is not always the answer. I personally think that it's not caused by aliens but there's always going to be people out there still thinking it was created by aliens.

In 1976 Viking 1 was cirleing around Mars when it took a picture in the region of Mars in Cydonia. It wasn't something that we would expect. It was very surprising, it looked like a face in the photo taken. A few days later NASA released some of the picture they took. Since than the ""Face"" became very popular it even has been in some Hollywood films.

I think that the ""Face"" is caused by the natural landform. Have you ever wonder why Mars is like Earth's twin or sisters well because they are alike. Earth has had natural landform just that in Mars it looks different but it doesn't mean nothing it's still a natural landform. Now I do understand why some people might say that it looks like it has been created by aliens cause it does look like a real face. The nose, eyes and mouth litterly looks like a real face of a person but just cause of that it doesn't mean it was made by aliens.

Now here is my true evidence that will convice people that the ""Face"" wasn't created by aliens. In 1976 was the first photo Viking 1 took. In 1998 another photo was taken later on in 2001 another photo was taken. If you see the pictures it is so obese that the ""Face"" on Mars is a natural landforming.

The Face attracted attention to Mars because many people believed that it was created by aliens. It was used in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and grocery store checkout lines. People began to believe there was life on Mars.

The Face is actually a mesa, or a huge rock formation, with its shadows making it appear to be a face. Jim Garvin said that if there were any objects in the picture of the face, such as airplanes or small shacks, they would have showed up. Therefore, civilization would have been seen in the picture. The Face also compares to something on Earth, which leads to the fact that it is a natural landform. It is similar to Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

82360EA27601,"There are a variety of perspectives and opinions related to the Face on Mars. Many say that it's simply a lava dome, or that it could just be a strange rock molded in such a way where it may appear to be a face. However one of the most popular arguments is that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. Although this is a very well-known opinion, it is false.

This is not the first time that such a conspiracy has been made in different cases, therefore something like this isn't as frazzling to the experts. On May 24, 2001 when sight of the Face on Mars was first made the scientists at NASA simply thought it to be another Martian Messa which was not the first sight of it making this something not taken to drastic measures. They thought of many different possibilities to why this was formed in a way that reminded us of an Egyptian Pharaoh such as the possibility of the camera's angle, the shadows covering it. Basically we thought of everything minus the chance that it may have been the works of such ""aliens"".

Aliens have been the illogical reasoning to many things we find on the various assortments of planets so hearing that this recent discovery was blamed on aliens isn't very shocking. We spent a few days deciding whether or not to show the images captured to the public, but in the end we decided to do so. The Face on Mars instantly became a well-known subject all over the world things such as movies, magazines, and even radio and tv talk shows all spoke of the mysterious Face on Mars. Many considered this discovery as the new pop icon. During this there were many conspiracy theorists who began to state that the Face on Mars was the work of aliens. However that's the thing, there are no statistical facts simply a load of different conspiracies made from people who strongly believe in such things! Considering there is lack of proof on even the stance that aliens are real the ""case"" was never thoroughly thought through.

There can be various reasonings and opinions about the Face on Mars and though they may be very amusing or interesting to hear, the reality of it is really that it is simply an isolated lava dome.

97156FFD0206,"Face on Mars? Aliens? What? Some conspiracy theorists believe that a face found on Mars from a photo taken by Viking 1 - a Mars Global surveyor -

was created by aliens who lived on the planet over 300 billion years ago. NASA released information and a picture about the 'Face on Mars,' to the media, with the caption, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head."" The face believed to be found on Mars is nothing less then a rock formation, and was not created by aliens.

Mission controller Garvin says, ""It's not easy to target Cydonia."" He also noted that his crew does not pass over the Face very often. This rock formation is nothing more then a piece of the planet that has been wore down by the clouds on Mars. Research shows evidence that this formation has been on Mars for billions of years. Over time the wind and atmosphere has shaped the rock into the form of what looks to be a Face.

NASA leaked evidence about the Face on Mars when they unveiled the image for the public and media to see, stating clearly that the Face was formed by, ""shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting to see the image on a JPL website, the text in fact quoted, ""It was a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

The people that do believe that there was alien life on Mars, think that the aliens markings were hidden by haze, and believe the Face is ""bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars. Contarary to what skeptics and other theorists think, there is no actual piece of true evidence discovered by NASA to prove otherwise.

Garvin and his team said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyarmids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" So this actual NASA evidence that the mysterious ""Face"" found on Mars was nothing but a simple landform.

The NASA Space Program has been around for decades. NASA has not yet found evidence to consider the Face on Mars was alien artifacts. Even with NASA's best cameras, there just isn't a theoretical proven fact that this could have become an artifact from ancient aliens. The Face on Mars, is not a face, but simply a landform, that was formed over billions of years ago. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
54351180CD4F,"Many have claimed that the human face found on Mars is an alien artifact, but how certain are they. According to NASA, the Face on Mars is just a rock formation that resembles the face of a human, but others may disagree. I believe that the Face found on Mars is just a natural landform. To further investiate this topic, we will begin by analyzing how the Face was formed and how it compares to lanforms on Earth, where it was located, and what causes others to believe that it is an alien artifact.

Some might believe that the so called ""alien artifact"" was lefted behind by aliens, but NASA unveiled an image of the Face and this is what they came up with. According to the caption of the image, it noted a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, annd mouth."" This image was even compared to natural landforms found on Earth. According to the passage, the picture portrays the ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. The passage also claims that the image reminds him of the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" and that the Face on Mars is about he same height of an isolated mesa- which is a landform.

The Face on Mars was located at 41 degress north martian latitude during the winter of April 1998. This time of the year was also considered to be the cloudiest time of year on the Red Planet. The fact that this image was found during the cloudiest time of year on Mars can affect the turn out of this theory. A few scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact, and photographing the Cydonia became one of the biggest priorities for NASA. As soon as the Viking mission was ended, the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated that they ""photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it."" I believe they did this to clarify their foundings.

As stated before, many people, including scientists, believe that the Face on Mars is an alien artifact and here are their reasons why. As the photo of the Face on Mars was being taken, it was claimed that the ""camera on board MGS had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the Face,"" and according to skeptics, ""alien markings were hidden by haze."" This did not stop mission controllers, and they prepared to look again. Garvin states that "" It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" and that its hardwork. Conspiracy theorists believe that the Face is ""bona-fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide."" Now this may all sound convincing, but it was also added that you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, causing false illusions.

In conlusion, after analyizing the data and research given, I believe that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Others may disagree, but it is all about your interprutation on the topic, and hopefully the evidence used to support my claims did just that.        ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
F11772D20D78,"The face on Mars has been said to be created by many things. ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars.""(paragraph 5) Other people believe that it is a natural landform. It could have been aliens, but we have yet to find life on Mars. The reason that makes the most sense as to why its there is that it is indeed a natural landform.

Sure the land may look like a face but it is simply a natural landform. It is possible that other life-forms were on this planet at some point, but it does not mean that it was created by them. Landforms like these occur here on Earth too. They are common around the American West. These are called buttes or mesas, and buttes are simply ""a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa.""(paragraph 12)

This landform even reminds people of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. These two are roughly the same height. The pictures of this mesa has changed over the years. In 1976 it strongly resembled a face. In 1998 it didn't appear as human-like as it did in 1976. And lastly in 2001, it just looks like a simple mesa, no face, no alien markings.

I do realize that it might make sense to you and other people that it could be made by aliens. But we have yet to find actual life on mars, let alone have it be made by non-existent creatures. This object object may seem extraordinary, but it is simply just a mesa on a planet we haven't even found running water on. I would love to say ""Yes, this was actually made by aliens!"" but sadly I cannot because it is simply just a landform.

Therefore it could not have been created by aliens because these landforms appear on Earth. It looks similar to landforms on Earth. It also has been photographed many times over the years with better cameras each time. Scientist can gladly say ""This is only a landform, in fact these also appear on Earth as mesas or buttes.""

2A624BC3D806,"Scientist know that the face is created by something else, but someone thinks aliens created it. I don't think aliens can do that. Many things could be the cause of the face on Mars, but I'm sure it's not aliens. Scientist have not proven that aliens are even real yet. If aliens were real scientist would know about it, and they might try to capture one. The face would of been causes by wind, the spacecraft, or it could of been a natural landform.

The face on Mars could have been caused by the wind. When planets rotate it could have cause some wind, and the wind could start to form piles of dirt. The dirt could have been moved into the shape of a face. The shadows give it an illusion of eye, nose, and mouth. The face didn't have any footprints around it so aliens couldn't done it. On Earth the wind blows, and pollen from one flower goes to another. Dirt on Mars could of blew to one area, and it could form a face.

Spacecrafts flying around Mars could have cause the face to appear. The air that is blowing out of the spacecraft could of blown the dirt into piles. Piles of dirts can form since the scapecraft is big. When the scapecraft takes off it could form the face because when air is blown out it leaves a mark. A spacecraft couldn't have left a mark by the face. The fuel on the spacecraft could of left a mark after blasting off Mars.

The face on Mars could be there naturally. It is the third planet from the sun. If there's any volcanoes; lava can explode out of it. Aliens wouldn't come out, and randomly make a face to scare people. The face on Mars must be natural because I don't believe that aliens are real. If aliens are real we probably would have seen one by now. Aliens can't be alive; if they were alive they would have to find food sometime.

However, the face could be have been maded by aliens. I'm stil shocked that people think they're real. I've never seen one before. aliens could be able to fly, and they don't have to touch the ground. The could pick up the dirt, and place it where ever they want to form the face. Inconclusion I still don't believe in aliens, but something had to happen to Mars. It could of been a natural landform or it could of been a spacecraft flying around Mars.

First, it was just a shadow that caught NASA's eye. Second, it was shown has a huge rock formation. Finally, they thought it was a alien markings.

When NASA first saw this they thought it looked like a face. A few days after that it says in the caption ""...the illusion of eyes nose, and mouth."" (3) But as it say it is a illision which means it plays tricks on your mind to make you think that's what you saw. This ""face"" appeared on the Viking 1 spacecraft.

Next the illision of the face was really just a rock formation. Qouted from the passage it says ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head..."" (3) This proves that it's just a rock in the shape of a human's face/ head. It also says in that same passage ""It would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Therefor this shows this it really was just a illision and that people really just wanted attention for mars.

Finally, the main thought of as a alien momument. This was proved wrong by the Mars Global Surveyor when it flew over Cydonia snappining a picture. These pictures were ten times sharper than the Viking 1 photos shot twenty five years ago. In the passage it states that ""the MOC team snapped a picture and it was 10x sharper than the first taken by the Viking 1 photos.""(7) This states that the Viking photos weren't good enough because it didn't show as much. After these pictures were taken they were then posted on the JPL web site that revealed it was just a natural landform.

B494FBAA8EAE,"The face on the plante of Mars was not created by aliens. Scientist have been studying this object for many years and with the new high-tech cameras and the new gear they have they are able to look at the picture very much more clear. The scientist have been studying and have recently just found out that it was just to be a mesa. The mesa is very common in Cydonia as it states in the article. It would make a tlot of sense if it would just be found out that it actually was.

The huge face was studied by Jim Garvin. He traveled to Cydoia to take a look at the face for his self. When he arrived by the huge mesa he took a very good picture to prove it was only a mesa and nothing more. Many people were not happy when they found out what Jim had to say. They were making statements that it was a winter day in that part of ""The Red Planet"" so it was very cloudy and so he probably just didn't see any of the symbols or signs that the aliens must have made.

The surveyor then went to Mars again in 2001 when it was all summer time by the huge mesa and he then took another photo. "" The photo was an extraordinary photo that was taken."" says Garvin himself. They eventually found out that it actually wasn't anything that the aliens have made but only a mesa.

Many other people or scientist might say that it is part of alien life because of where it was placed and how it actually looks. People say it is a sign from the aliens or martians. It is impossible for it to be from the aliens because it has been studied for years and years and photos have been taken multiple times to show that it was nothing more than only a mesa.

Aliens don't have the knowledge to know how to make a human face because they have never seen one before. How would an alien or a martian know what a human face looks like. They don't lnow so it couldn't have been from any alien activity

My ruling stands in what in know about the mesa that was found on Mars. People cant argue because it was scientifically proven that it is not a face on the face of the planet it is only a mesa.

When our Viking 1 was scanning the planet to find a safe place for the next space craft to land, Viking 2, Viking 1 suddenly ""spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" The scientists at first, were excited, but then we realized that it was probably a common Martian mesa. We just assumed that ""this one had unusual shadows."" We believe it to be just a natural land form that just happens to have the right shadows to look like a face, not some alien monument.

Soon, we decided that we needed to get a better picture. On April 5, 1998 our Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia to take a picture of the Face. The picture was ""ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" The photo revealed that the Face is just a natural landform. There were no markings on it or anything that could prove the Face to be something like an alien monument or anything made by possible life on Mars.

Then we had people arguing that because of the location of the Face, 41 degrees north martian latitude, and that it was ""winter in April '98-a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" People said that our camera would have to look through clouds. Skeptics said ""alien markings were hidden by haze."" Even so, it is unlikely that all the markings would be covered up, but we began to get ready to look again to hopefully settle everything about the Face.

Although it is very difficult to target Cydonia, on April 8, 2001 we got a second look. This was a ""cloudless summer day."" ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the feild of view,"" Garvin said. The picture was taken with maximum resolution.

So, if there were objects in this picture like arplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

In conclusion, the Face is just another natural landform. There are no signs of it being made by possible life on Mars. If there were signs even of possible life on Mars, I am sure we would have been able to see clues of it and if the Face was made by them. There is nothing provided to us to suggest hat the Face was made by aliens. We just don't have proof if it. The Face is however very similar to a butte or mesa.

5C9E3926D9B3,"Are aliens real or just a myth? Aliens have supposedly done many things on the planets. The question is, did the aliens create The Face on Mars? Or is The Face just a natural landform on Mars? There are many theories on which one is true.

The Face on Mars is just a natural landform on Mars. There is a theory that has been going around for centuries, that aliens created The Face. Many people will believe whatever they hear on T.V. or anything that draws the media attention. People forget that they need facts and or evidence proving something. Otherwise it will only ever be consindered a theory.

Mars happens to be like Earth in many ways. There was once water on the red planet. That has facts to back it up. Mars is believed to have once held life, it may or may not be true. NASA is still working on whether or not Mars had life there once. Yet, since Mars is our sister planet, also may have common characteristics. As in there natural landmarks.

FD65FEAAB0BC,"Yes, many people do think that the ""Face on Mars"" was a monument created by aliens, possibly creating a sign of some sort. However, this is not true. What you think is the ""face"" is actually a natural landform. This natural landform may appear to look like a face, but why?

The landform looks like a face becuase of the shadows that hit the landform in certain areas. ""... this... had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh (2)."" It makes it look somewhat like a face. ""...a huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth (3)."" Another reason why the landform looks like a face is becuase our eyes, that play tricks on us, may make it seem real that it is a face. Such as illusion that make it appear that the landform looks like a face that is staring up at the camera on Mars. Many poeple, however will still ask for more evidence that the landform is not alien artifact.

""...Mars Oribiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the origional... photos... when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no monument at all (7)."" ""What the picture actually shows in the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West... That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars (12)."" So the landforms that you are seeing are actually common along the American West. They don't just pop up out of nowhere. They have been seen before. It's not like it is a first thing that scientists are just discovering.

This evidence proves that there is no alien monument on Mars, it may appear to look like it. But scientists have proved that it is only a natural landform, created naturally, on Mars. Not an alien monument that was created as a sign by aliens on Mars.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
1493603F96F3,"The face of Mars is a landform that looks just like a face. Even though it looks like a face, it has been proven that it is just a landform and if you zoom in on it, you can tell that it isnt manmade. There are landforms on Earth that look just like the face too.

Scientists have zoomed in on the picture and have proven that the face of Mars is just a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Butte's, or mesa's, are landforms common around the American West and are also on Mars. The face of Mars is just a really odd shaped butte and people have mistaken it for alien structures. The face also kind of looks like a butte called Middle Butte in Idaho. People have also said that the face looks about the same height as the Middle Butte in Idaho.

The people at NASA had the first pictures of the butte zoomed out enough that it looked like a face. The NASA camera that takes pictures of Mars is in a wierd position so it doesnt pass the face that much and when it does, its not very close so when they zoom in, the pixels are too big to see. When they actually got a good picture of the face, people started to relize that it was just a wierd landform. When they got a good picture, people probably stopped thinking that aliens made it and just ignored it.

Even though scientists have proven that the face of Mars is just a landform, some people probably just think they are trying to cover it up. Landforms can have all kinds of shapes and the face of Mars just has a very unique shape. In conclusion, the face of Mars is just a odd shaped Butte.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
D627DA8BF3CB,"Do aliens really exist and are they capable of doing something like this? I don't think they could but if they were capable of doing something like this. We will need some proof to stand with this. There is 3 reasons why this is just a natural landform. They can just be like any landform on earth, a face like this can happen anywhere else, and if you believe in aliens are they really capable of doing something like this?

The first reason why this is just a natural landform is because it can also happen on earth. For example, this can happen upon natural sources. Such eratation and it can just be a mesa. Another example is, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough round Cydonia""(2). If this is common than most likely it wouldn't be made by any alien. My last example for this is, most landforms have ways it can look. The landforms can happen anywhere and that wouldnt mean it was caused by an alien. If something like this happened on earth most people would think it was caused by natural thigs like the weather.

My second reason is that things can happen anywhere. For example, another planet my have this but that doesnt mean an alien went and left it there so we could find it. If an alien did this we would be able to find something almost the same as this face. Another example is, ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars""(5). This can be true but if it was an alien wouldnt they do a face they new or reconized. Lastly, in the passage it states that ""There was no alien monument after all"". The picture clearly showed a landform not an alien made monument. In conclusion, things like this can happen in different forms but nobody has proven it was made by an alien.

My last reason for why this is not an alien made monument is because there is no proof that aliens made it. For example, have aliens been proven to exist. No proof was every made that aliens exist in the planet mars. Secondly, how could they build such a thing. if aliens built it than there must be a great amount of them that we did not know about. Lastly, if aliens aready built a Face on Mars why can't they do the same thing on Earth. there is no explanation of they wouldn't be able to do this. In order for the aliens to make something like this that would mean they are capable of this and more but they still haven't been proven to exist.

In conclusion, the face could have been made by something other than aliens. The three reasons explaining why it couldn't have been aliens is it could have been done by nature, it can happen somewhere else, and are aliens capable of this. This can prove that aliens didnt build it, that it could have been made by different things.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
2EB693F2A6DD,"The face. A pop icon, a very controversial topic, an alien landform. Those are some of the most common pieces of discussion surrounding this mysterious landfrom captured in 1976. Is it a hub for aliens? Is it a landform much like the ones we study in the American West? There are many theorists that believe the landform has alien origins, but they have no substantial evidence. While many continue to believe given the reality, there are no alien origins to this landform.

There was no alien life form ever captured in any pictures. In 1998, the picture was retaken 10 times sharper than the one released in 1976. It showed, absolutely no signs of any alien life at all. Still, many believed NASA was covering up some conspiracy surrounding aliens, or blaming the weather, which happened to be cold and cloudy. Since the weather could have been a factor, they reshot the picture in 2001 on a sunny and cloudless day, with a better spacecraft, and Jim Garvin, the chief scientist at NASA stated that it looked like a butte or mesa, landforms common in the midwest. He called it a lava dome that had taken the form of a mesa, having the same height as the face, proving there to be no alien origins, just a natural landform.

If there was alien life form on Mars,NASA would benefit from it. They would go down in history as the first people to have discovered alien life, get funding for years of research, and become more popular than ever, increasing their livelyhood. A few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, showing that the scientists had also been hoping for any chance of alien activity, but hadn't found any. They released pictures to the media, asked for feedback, and kept everyone updated on their findings. They themselves seemed optimistic in the first two expeditions to Mars, hoping to find any signs of alien life, reshooting repeatedly to get the best picture. It would be useless for NASA to not release information that could be beneficial to themselves.

They took multiple sets of pictures in different years. They performed multiple trips to Cydonia, snapping multiple pictures. They went in 1976, when it was first discovered, 1998, revealing no alien life form, and 2001, revealing it to be a lava dome. Each time, they took multiple pictures, studying and publishing them for the world to see. They had found absolutley nothing in 1998 and 2001 that could point to any life forms existing on Mars, proving the theory of aliens on the face to be false.

While many people continue to believe that the face is proof of aliens, they have no concrete evidence. They are using old tales, myth, and folklore, with little to no evidence to help their argument. All the arguemnts made against the pictures were silenced, making it impossible to find strong evidence to prove alien origins. After snapping the picture in 2001, it became clear the face was just a mesa, nothing more than a natural landform with odd shadows and ridges, resembling a face.

If we were trying to hide something, why would we show it to everyone? Those are the crazy things I'm talking about. Un-needed sceptics and conspiracy theorists to question the goals of NASA as a whole, just because we found this and shared it with the world.

However, when its another world, its a completely different story? No. Mars is a desert, and why cant formations like this be found there? The truth is they can.

NASA has all the evidence to prove that their isn't a face on the planet Mars, but just a regular landform.

Some people were unsatisfied and some was with the conclusion NASA came up with involving the Face on Mars. Others thought perhaps the alien markings were hidden by haze.

2E7B7DA84C7A,"On May 24, 2001, a NASA Viking 1 spacecraft had saw a landform on Mars that had happened to look like a human face. The spacecraft had taken pictures of this landform and show the world a few days later in order to attract people to Mars. Some people, like conspiracy theorists, say that it's evidence of alien life that NASA has hidden from the public, but if this had been something NASA was hiding, they wouldn't have show that photo at all to the public. Scientists and astronaunts have denied this by adding titles that suggest otherwise on there photos, showing the photo in the first place, and going back up to space to take more pictures.

According to paragraphs 1 though 5, NASA had found a landforn that resembled a human face of an Egyptian Pharaoh located on a region called Cydonia. Mission control was surprised to see the face, but believed it was just another Martian mesa with unusual shadows, so they decided to reveal the pictures to the media, knowing there wasn't anything ""top secret"" or alien like about it. Then, according to paragraph 5, NASA had captioned the image, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth,"" basically telling the public that it was just a quirky looking natural landform, not a big alien conspiracy theory. People defending the NASA budget even claimed they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars, basically meaning there wasn't life that they knew of. Finally, in paragraph 7, another NASA spacecraft went over Cydonia on APril 5, 1998 and took better, sharper pictures, showing that it was just a natural landform that didn't have a civilization in it.

In conlusion, NASA was not trying to hide a whole big alien civilization theory from the world. They had just saw a cool natural landform with weird shadows that made it look like a human face and decided to share it with the world. If there was a conspiracy, NASA wouldn't have showed the picture to the world, added a title stating that it was an artifact, or have willingly went back up to space to take another picture of the landform. Therefore, NASA is not hiding any ancient alien civilizations from the United States, or any other part of the world.   ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
6BBB2ED0EDDB,"The Face on Mars is a natural landform and not something that was created by aliens. The Face is a natural landform because the sharper pictures that were taken after the Viking photos revealed that it was a natural landform. Secondly, the scientists had taken another photograph which helped confirm what exactly the Face was. Also, the text states that the Face is ""equivalent of a butte or mesa."" Although some people think that the Face was created by aliens, there isn't enough information to support that claim.

First of all, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team flew over Cydonia in 1998. According to the passage, they ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" This means that this camera probably caught eye of more objects and got a more detailed idea of what this formation looks like. The Viking photos weren't as detailed, so the people who saw those photos originally got the idea that aliens had created it. The picture that was captured had revealed that this was, in fact, a natural landform.

Secondly, the Mars Global Surveyor went back to Cydonia on a cloudless day, since some people were second-guessing if the picture was accurate or not. According to the text, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution,"" meaning that they could retrieve even more detailed objects. For example, the story says that if there were objects like shacks or airplanes, then they could see what they were. Also, the text states that ""each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" People could trust these pictures and what scientists say that it is a natural landform because these photographs were very detailed.

Lastly, the very detailed photograph that was taken showed that the Face was equivalent to a butte or mesa. Butte and mesas are landforms that are commonly found around the American West. According to the passage, Garvin compared the Face to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He had said ""that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" Also, the scientists had already figured that this Face was another Martian mesa because they were commonly found around the area of Cydonia. This information is showing that the Face is most likely a landform.

The Face on Mars is a landform because of the factual evidence that was found. The cameras that were used were high quality, providing photographs that were very precise and accurate. Also, the photographs had showed that the Face was similar to formations on Earth. Therefore, all of this information concludes that the Face on Mars is indeed a landform and was not formed by aliens. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

I see why most belivers, in aliens, believe that aliens did it; its out of the ordnary,just not answerable,or because it's more questionable than anything. Now you can go around saying that aliens did do it, but be positve and ahve evidence on why you think that.

Web surfers were anxious while waiting for the image to be reveled on the JPL web page. The image showed what appeared to be just a natural landfoorm, not an alien monument or anything that had to do with aliens at all.

Belivers thougth that the alien makers were just covered up by the haze or fog. Then the next time on April 8, 2001 on a cloudless day the ""reasearchers"" spotted the face again after a complete orbit around Mars and snapper another quick shot. It wasn't as easy as it sounded, they had to roll the spaceraft 25 degrees to the middle so you could see the face entirely.

After they had gotten the second picture they ""blew it up"" and made it 3 times bigger than its original size. When that happened, you could see anything and everything else that was around on the planet in that particular spot, if there were any airplanes or any other pyrmids.

While, some people think that the face on Mars is ""bona-fide evidence"" that there once was life there. NASA has defended that remark by saying that they wish that it was a mark of ancient civilization but, it's not. NASA has also made it a priority to photograph the face because, they felt as if it was ""important to the taxpayers"" to give them evidence that it wasn't an alien landform.

So, in 1998 they flew a shuttle over Cydonia, the face/lanform, for the first time to go take pictures of it. Thousands of people were waiting to see pictures of it. It had turned out to be just a landform ,like NASA had said, not an ancient lifeform. Many people disagreed with the pictures that NASA took because they had stated that it was cloudy during the time they had taken the pictures on Mars so, they couldn't really get a clear shot of the face. While NASA agreed with them that it was a cloudy time of year on Mars they are still sure that there has never been life on the planet.

Everyone seems to believe that the face on mars was created by Aliens. They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform. But, do they actually do research like the scientists do? There are many reasons that the face on mars is just a lanform, and here are those reasons.

First off, when NASA's Vicking one spacecraft was just circling and roaming around it came across something unexpecting. By snapping a few pictures, they believed it was a face. Later, when it was revealed to the world, people believed that aliens had made that mark on mars. The texts says, that no one has past over that ""face"" in awhile. So how come a few pictures identify a face by using one camera? So that's when scientist decided to investigate the face on mars.

After scientists did a little research on their own, ""The Face"" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west. How can that be? Well, i will expect no one to believe that because for 25 years it was known as the face on mars. Scientists had to travel up to space by Mars and snap several pictures of the face. After they did their research collected thir data it came out to be a landform.

Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera. What's the difference its just a camera. Well, that camera captured the truth about mars. For proof, if you looked online you can actually see what was really there. Even NASA's spacecraft revealed it to be a messa. So, it was just a false staement. There was no alien monument, in the first place. So for 25 years the face on Mars was actually a messa. But NASA would rather hide the truth about what they saw. So until, it's revealed as an actual face, it will be known as a messa or some peopel still say it's the face of Mars.

So with that all said, the face turned out to be a messa. So with the actual data, everyone should know that it is a messa. So wa sthe face really created by aliens, no it was not. It was really a landform.            ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

First of all, many photos taken by NASA themselves show no evidence of aliens, but natural landmasses. On April 5, 1998, NASA sent the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) over Cydonia. MIchael Malin and his team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Once that happened, it was revealed to the public that the Face was just a landform. This proves that the mass was indeed a landmass. Also, these pictures were taken after the original one(the one that got everyone speculatng about the origin of the landmass), which means that the new pictures are much clearer and thus more believable han the original.

Secondly, many of the theories around the Face of Mars being a definite sign of aliens, are all conspiracy theories. The fifth paragraph states,"" Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This quote from the article proves that there are many people who make up theories that have no credibility or legs to stand on. Also, many of these claims hold no cocrete evidence but are rather based on speculation.

Finally, NASA deployed the MGS yet again on April 8, 2001- a cloudless day in Cydonia. Paragraph ten explains,"" We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution."" Also, paragraph twelve states,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West."" These quotes prove that the picture was the best resolution it be, and the Face was still depicted as a landmass. Also, they compare these landforms to landforms commonly found in the American West. This concludes that the Face is not of any extra-terrestrial activity, but just a misunderstanding made by conspiracy theorist.

In conclusion, based on the evidence from the article, the Face is in fact a landform of Mars. This states that there is no extra-terrestial life in our universe( as of right now). This article teaches people that you should not listen to conspiracy theories, but facts that have evidence to support it.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The only reason the formation look like a face is becuase of that shadows. The angle that they were at made shadows that looked like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. The carma they were using at the time also wasnt that great. It was good for the time but it is not as accurate compared too more recent camras.

In the next few photos of the face of mars you can clearly see that it is just a rock formation and not a face. The face of mars was just a rock formatoin and some perfictley placed shadows. In the most recent picture of it you can see that it looks nothinhg like a face and just like a hill or big rock. Some people might say that NASA is just trying to hide the alain life but this is false.

If NASA really found life forms on a diffrent planet they would tell every body because they would make a lot of money. Every body would be interested in the new life forms and want to learn all about them. They would help found NASA to do research and do every thing they could to learn more. This meaning NASA would expaned a lot. It would get so much more income and job applications.

The the face of mars looks just like some of the natural land forms on earth. This is also just another way to prove that it is not a sign of alein life.

On May 24, 2001 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the plants when it took a picture oof a face that was planted on planet Mars known as the Red Planet. The picture looked like a shadowy likeness of a human face. The head in the picture was enormous. We figured that the face was nearly 2 miles from end to end. Some time later after studying and researching the picture, we leaked the picture to the public so they could give us there thoughts about it because NASA always likes to here from the people. As soon as the picture was public lots of people where saying that it looked like it was created by aliens. It was attracting lots of people. But a big percentage of those people said it looked like an aliens face which was a Huge rock formation but they kept defending their statement. But i want to make people believe NASA hat it was a Rock formation created by erosion and rock movement through out the years.

Most people have been saying that this face was created by aliens but i dont think so. The reason why i dont think this face was created by aliens is because just like on earth there is erosion,rocks,and plaitonic movement. On Mars there is that to, the only three things Mars dosen't have is oxygen, water, or any subtance of food or plants that make oxygen. The exprience at NASA over the years and the studying and researching every day and having to do expriments on the picture, have determine that those figures are caused by rock movement or metiorids that hit planet Mars. The thing is that no one really could of created that without any food or water.

I think after all the research NASA has done and the studying of the natural landform on Mars that was created by Rock Formation turns out to be ture and for evryone that thinks that me and my team at NASA are wrong well no i don't think i am wrong i think i am way beyond positive that we are right because NASA has done everything they can to bring the people the right information. The people that think the natural landform was created by alliens need to join NASA so they can come along see that NASA brings only the truth noting but the truth to the people.

261221C64ED0,"""So, what you're trying to tell me, is that out of some kinda coincidence, the face was truly just an illusion due to the shadows?"" the man asked. ""I'm not buying it.""

""Yes,"" I replied, ""and I'm about to show you why I'm right.""

The man momentarily snickered and went on to say, ""I'm all ears.""

The face on Mars has long been debated about whether or not it was pure coincidence, or truly an alien landmark that could spark the truth of whether or not aliens truly may exist on planet Mars. Today, I (Nasa Operative) am going to confirm this coincidence simply as nothing more than Martian terrain with a perfect and unusual casting of shadows to create the illusion, along with the help of the article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"".

To begin, as of the past, technology was not very advanced when the first glance at the face was looked at. As of then, the picture was more blurry, and an illusion was casted. These two go hand in hand, as it makes the landscape look more like a face. However, the recent pictures withold better, sharper, and newer quality in which were taken at different angles and lighting, have proven that the ""face"" was nothing more than Martian landscape. I know this because, ""Malin's team captured an extrodinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. 'As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, ' he added.' 'So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa---landforms common around the American West.""

Furthermore, this set of information proves the theory of an alien artifact wrong. Although many still believe the artifact and that it regeardless may be true life is on Mars, the face is irrelevant to an alien theory and has been debriefed as no more than part of a Martian messa.

""Whatever, geek! You're just saying this stuff to put it in my head!"" angrily defended the man.

79E165166080,"Many believe that the ""Face"" on Mars was actually created by aliens.

This landform gives off the illusion that it is a face.

To clear all confusion, the Face on Mars wasn't created by aliens.

As the cameras traveled around Mars what appeared to be a head from end to end stretching two miles was actually a Martian mesa.

Martian mesa's are common around Cydonia therefore NASA made the assumption that it was.

This Martian mesa was a bit different than the others.

This one had unusual shadows that gave off the look to be an Egyptian Pharaoh but was still considered a mesa.

Secondly, this landform was common around the American West.

This butte or ""mesa"" was just more oddly shaped than the others. This landform was created by a lava dome which caused it to look like a face somehow.

Garvin refrenced the Middle Butte in Snake River Plain in Idaho which is another idea that it was just a landform.

On the contrary, this could be an alien made figure. The landform gave off an illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth.

The passage also stated the landform stretched two miles from end to end which made the ""head"".

If the structure was bona fide that means it was well-rounded and nicely structured which means it took time to come together then it was done by what we call a second life.

NASA would rather hide that being afraid of conspiracy theorists.

To conclude, the ""Face"" on Mars isn't an actual face.

This structure is just a landform proven by NASA with statistical facts and photographs.     ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
34090CBF1239,"Did aliens create an amazing masterpiece on Mars or are you just imagining that they did? Aliens surely do not exist or are for sure not on Mars. It is theretithized that aliens have formed or made an object that seems to look like a human face. I think that aliens didn't do it in many different ways. Such as, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Also, by using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of them. Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Just because we wonder about something, doesn't mean that it's really there.

First of all, this object resembles different landforms that co-exist on Earth. Different landforms that it resenmbles are rivers, volcanos, and mountains. This closely resembles the Snake River Plain in Idaho because of it's swirly indentions. Also in one of the pictures it looks as if it have hot boiling lava bubbling inside of it. And finally it shows high elevations such as the Rocky Mountains. This ""alien created object"" looks very similar to the many different landforms on Earth. This is one of the many reasons why it was not made by aliens but if there were any aliens wouldn't we have known about them by now?

Concequently, using our satelittes, we would've already seen pictures of the aliens if they lived on Mars. With all of the advanced technology that we have today you would've thought that our satelittes would've taken pictures of the aliens, right? Some reasons why we should've already seen aliens are that we have satelittes that can take high definition pictures, not only but also; we've launched many different programs towards Mars to take pictures but none of them have came back with positive results for aliens. And finally the rovers that we have sent to Mars have come back with little information about vital items needed to survive on a planet. With high definition pictures we can tell if there are any shelters, food, water, etc. on Mars, however there's not. Then again many different space progams hav launched satelittes to take pictures, but there is no vital signs. Finally the rocket propelled rovers that have landed on Mars have came back with little information about items needed to survive. There it is, another good reason and reality why aliens did not create this human looking landform, but it might've just been positioning why we thought that it looked human.

Finally, many different factors could've made it to look as if resembling a human face. Different factors such as the position of the sun, clouds, and or temperature could've made this ""plain"" look human. The sun might've made the shadows of different hills look like eyes and a mouth. The clouds could've covered or angled the sun to make different shadows on the hilly area. Maybe the heat waves deformed the plateu to resemble a human. Nobody knows for sure and unless the exact same situation happens again we might find out, but until then I beleive that it is not possible that aliens made this landform.

It is possible that aliens exist and I don't doubt that they live without of our reach but I think that it is not possible for them to exist this close to us and we have not found out about it yet, therefore they are not real.

Everyone wonders what is beyond our reach, but just because you imagine it does that neccesarily mean that it is real? I think that all the examples like it looks like landforms on Earth, we should've seen picture of aliens, and many different factors might have effected our view are definitly reasons why aliens did not create this. Wondering and believing are both good things but if you don't focus on the truth of reality, you will not suceed.   ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
CFDF8A9D409D,"""Face"" the Facts

The face on Mars. We've all heard of it. From pictures on Instagram to movies, it has become a phenomenon of the modern age. Since 1976 the face on Mars has had conspiracy theorists dying to uncover the ""truth"" about the face. Some think it's proof of alien colonies or other supernatural reasons. Some think it's proof of a ancient chicken supreme race. OK, maybe not, but that's barely anything compared to the crazy theories about this face. To tell the truth, the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing more than a natural landform.

First, why would NASA lie to people? They wouldn't lie. In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" it says ""...defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" (Paragraph 5) How popular would NASA be if they found proof of alien life, or how much support they'll get (or money) to fund NASA and the projects to space if they say they found alien life? They'd get a lot of fame and support if they say that they found their proof of alien life. Covering up the fact that there's proof for alien life is pointless and unneccecary to NASA.

Next, aliens can't exist on Mars. Sure it can support the life of some bacteria, but can it really support the life of any creature? A creature that can live on Mars without needing water, air, and can live off the cold is simply impossible. Not to mention that the creature would need to be smart enough to build the face and procreate. There's no alien babies on Mars. The creature that supposedly lived on Mars didn't come from thin air. If Mars was suitable for life then why isn't it today? The answer is because it never was.

Finally, it has been scientifically proven that the face is the result of a Mars equivilent of a mesa. According to the same article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" (Paragraph 12). That same paragraph goes on to say how the face on Mars is very similar to a Butte on Earth: the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It's not that far fetched to think that the face is a mesa. There's solid evidence behind it like the picture that the MGS took in 2001 proves there's no face.

To add on, Its time for theorists to take off their tin foil hats and face it. The possibility of aliens building the face on Mars is impossible. That won't stop them from finding something to counter the logical evidence. Theorists never stop believing in their own theories. The evidence presented is enough to

In conclusion, alien life on Mars is impossible, the face is a mesa, and NASA wouldn't lie to people in that sense. It's just that simple. Even though the theory that the face on Mars has been disproven, don't stop believing in the impossible. The world is a magical place, and there's more mysteries to be solved.

D9C24EDF97A9,"Since we had sent surveyors to Mars we have found many interesting things. We learned about much of the landscapes there and compared them to what we have here. Like the Earth, Mars also has a mesa biom. The face in the area of Mars know as Cydonia is a mesa biom, so natural formations accur. The face that we have discovered is not an alien structure because almost no true scientists think it is alien, high resolution cameras showed no signs of alien life, and it is natural because it is in a mesa biom.

The first reason that you should not believe that the face is an alien monument is because almost all the scientists agree that it is not a alien structure. As it said in the article, ""Few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact."" They are the ones that truely study this topic and know all about it, so we need to believe them. They also took the picture to draw attention to Mars and how unique it is, not to convince every one that there are aliens. The picture was slightly blurred and showed a unique stucture that was naturaly created.

The second reason is that the first image was burry and did not have the best quality. This could have made it look like it was made by someone or something other than nature. The new images were cearer and prooved that it was natural and that there were no alien artifacts.

The biggest and most obvious reason that should convince everyone is that it is a mesa biom. Things like this form all the time and should not be thought of a being made by anything other than nature. Take Earth for example, we have the same kind of region and it has land forms just as unique and different in their own ways. The formation on Mars was just more unlikely to accur than the other ones. Throughout time things change, and chances are that the Earth has or has had a similar landform that looked like a head.

There is no proof that aliens are on Mars. There is no proof that aliens are real. Nobody will ever be able to prove that aliens created the face because it will change, and eventually will not look like a face anymore. The face on Mars is obviously not an alien relic because almost every scientist agrees, high resolution pictures show it is not alien, and it is a mesa biom so this is natural.",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

In the world of today, you can never prove anything to be real without people spreading rumors.

Some conspiracy theorists like to think that there actually is life on Mars, and that's fine, but their reasoning is not credible and make believe. In the story it states ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This reasoning behind believeing that there is life on Mars is unfactual and merely people's opinion. But as soon as my co-workers and I heard that people thought the Face was real, we took matters into our own hands and managed to take a couple of other photographs of the landform. Under a closer inspection in 2001 we were able to see that the mysterious Face was a ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" as stated in the text. No ancient alien civilization, just a common landform.

In conclusion, my team here at NASA and I have proven that the pop icon ""Mars martian face"" is actually a natrual landform that can be found just about anywhere.

Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars."" Garvin also said about the Face. Natural landforms are usually formed by Natural events. Probably the same thing that happened on Mars. When Mars Gloval Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, it snaped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking pictures and all it revealed was a natural landform, no alien monument. Although some said that the alien markings might have been hidden by haze, there still was no alien markings to be found after the next picture they took on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia.

There is no Human, or animal that has a face that is that big The biggest animal on earth is a whale, and the face looks like a humans, and humans aren't miles wide and long, so there is no way that that ""face"", is real.

Alien's aren't real, People try and try to find alienlife out in the universe, but they never find it, you know why? It's because Aliens don't exist, so since they don't exist, then there is no way that they made the face, and a pyramid on mars.

I believe that the Face is a natural landform because of the information from the text.

Starting of on May 24, 2001 when the Viking 1 space craft found the face when it was searching for an area for its sister Viking 2 to land.

In 1976, the Face was not that clear at the time until 1998 when it started to take more shape.

I believe that if it was not a natural landform, NASA would have probably kept quite about it until they offically knew that it was or was not a natural landform.

Just because when it came, people are statring to think that the Face is ""bone fide evidence of life on Mars.""

If there was life on Mars, people all around the world would know about the it, and possibly would try to travel to Mars to see such life forms.

Yet know has tried, we humans have only sent robots to do the work on Mars for us.

On April 8, 2001 when they took the picture the second time, they have recievced a photo that they could compare to the picture that the Viking 1 took in 1976.

I believe that it is just a landform because the qoute from Garvin when he said ""It reminds me nost of Middle Butte in thr Snake River Plin of Idaho"" so it must just be a landform creation when it can remind some on of an experience the already seen.

In closing, from the facts from the story I believe that the Face is not alien life, but it is a natural landform that has been created over time.                                    ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Although many people disbelieve this is not a face, there is many places out west that look like this, and the cameras we used for this mission are to clear, and catch the smallest details, to be counted as incorrect. I believe that the Face, is only a landmark.

Based on the story, Unmasking the Face on Mars, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" When this picture was showed to the world, many people thought it looked like a face, just like many scientst. but the people from NASA called it a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head..."" formed by shadows, giving it an ilusion of a face. Many people still doubted this, and wanted to believe it was a face. I can see how it looks like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but just because it looks like somthing, it doesn't mean it is that.

Don't get me wrong. I do believe that it looks like a person, or alien, but many things look like something else, and it doesn't mean thats what they are, because of looks. The story, Unmasking the Face on Mars states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American west."" So based on this sentence, it could be a formation like out west. it has the same height as one in Idaho. It could have a different face then ones on Earth, but I highly doubt it is an alien.

The first, and second image on Mars look like faces, and appear to have all the needs to be a face. The second image wasn't really clear, and many people are right. Some people say, ""the face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it is winter in April '98-a cloudy time of yer on the Red Planet. Perhaps alien marking were hidden by haze."" This could be true. I do believe that if there was anything little, or hard to see, it couldn't be found when it was really cloudy outside, and the picture wasn't taken clearly.

Even though you couldn't see what was there, on the second picture, we did take another one. I do believe that some things could have been hidden, but they would have been found, with the third picture. Based on the text, ""if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" you would be able to see anything. So there was nothing there. the only thing that was there, ws a land formation, just like Earth has. We weren't able to find anything that would make the formation, considered to be some type of alien creation.

Based on research, and facts from, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" I believe that the Face, was actually just a land formation. For those who believe it was an alien, then you might be right, but from evidence, I think that it is just a cool and unique formation. The first images were unclear, to tell, but the thir image, was very clear, and us people from NASA, discovered that it wasn't an alien, but just a formation, like a butte or mesa. The Face, had shadows that made it look like eyes, a nose, and a mouth, but it actually wasn't. ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
D0F868BF34E6,"I think that the face on mars is just a nautral landform because the text states that few scientists believed it was an alien artifact. Also, the passage says that on April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and the team snapped a picture, revealing that it was just a landform. Even though the team did this, people still beleive that it was a face. The Face of Marshad become a very big thing for pop culture. It was on TV, was in books, and on the radio.

We see things in everyday life like clouds. They remind us of animals, objects, maybe even memories. I cannot make a conclusion and say that cloud is a bunny and think that one day a bunny was in the cloud and it's face started to form. It is based on your perspective. To me, it looks like a natural landform on Mars but maybe to other people it looks like some type of ancient face. If people think it is an ancient face then people are going to ask questions then it creates an even bigger mystery. This was just coencidence. So, that is why I think that the creation on Mars is just a natural landform.         ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
20A7311B9BCB,"I believe that the face is just a natural landform. I know this because people discovered or proven if or if not there is life on Mars. People always talk about martians, but never really find them.

Mars has peculiar weather conditions. They have dust storms. They dust gets whipped by wind. Mars also gets hit by meoters and rarely, astroids. An astroid hit Mars hard enough that a piece of it flew to the Earth. When Mars gets hit, it forms craters on the surface and can go deep into the ground. The wind could have possibly pushed dust into a crater and formed the face.

Also, NASA sends different space crafts and structure to take a look at Mars. Usually the crafts land on 3 or more legs. The craft could have possibly marked a dust mound. Wind three or more legs, you could form the face on Mars' surface.

What NASA needs to do is send more crafts and robots. I think they should do that to get mor eevidence then just taking some pictures. THe robots can do things that a human would. The robot can feel the face and dig to see what is under it. Yes, it would ruin the face but we would get evidence and details if we try.

In conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform. We to strive to find evidence on why it is there and why it formed. Maybe there is Life on Mars. The world may never know.      ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
F6E5CE071DA4,"The face is just a natural landform and not evidence of an alien attack. There are many reasons why this landform is only natural and not any type of alien proof. One of those is that if NASA found a secret alien civiilization they would tell us because it would help increase their budget. Another reason that it's just a natural landform is because it is just like some other natural landforms on Earth and other mesa's on Mars. The last reason that I will be talking about in this essay is that NASA is scietifically trained and would know if it was proof of alien's existence but the conspiracy theorists aren't scientifically trained and would be less likely to know exactly what it is.

The first reason that it's just a natural landform is that NASA would tell us if it was proof of an alien attack. It states in the text that ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars"" which shows how it would help increase their budget. Since the Face is so popular and has even become a pop icon if NASA were to find out it was proof of an alien attack they would most likely tell us because since it is so popular it would give them a significant increase to their budget. That is just one of the three reasons that I will b talking about in this essay.

The second reason that the Face is just a natural landform is because it is just like other landforms on Earth and around that area on mars. In the article it says ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa--landforms common around the American West"". That passage from the article shows that there are landforms on Earth that look similar to that one on Mars so it couldn't be proof of an alien attack. The article also says ""scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharaoh"". That shows that other landforms that resemble the Face on that part of Mars isn't uncommon. The only thing that made the Face stand out from other landforms was the shadows which made it appear to have a face that looked like an egyptian pharoah.

The third and final reason that I will be talking about in this essay is that the scientists would know better than any of the conspiracy theorists would so we should believe them. NASA has no reason to hide the Face from us because even if it was an alien attack, as I stated in paragraph two, it would help increase their budget. Other conspiracy theorists believe NASA is just trying to hide the proof of an alien attack but if that was what they were doing, they wouldn't have released a picture of the Face at all. Also when NASA realeased a new high resolution image in 2001 and a 3D altimetry of the Face, the landform no longer reseambled a face, which is proof that it is just a mesa.

Those 3 reasons are the reasons you should believe scientists and not think it is an alien landform. NASA has nothing to hide since it would increase their budget. They also are more trained in knowing what landforms on mars are than any conpiracy theorists are. The other reason is because there are many other landforms on Earth that resemble faces which could be compared to the Face. Those 3 reasons are why we should all stop trying to make conspiracy theories and just believe what NASA is trying to tell us, that it's just a mesa.         ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
3241E716DACF,"Long ago, Vikings spotted a shadowy figure that resembled a human face. It was about two miles long and was located on a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Some people are convinced that aliens on the Red Planet, but others would beg to differ. Most scientists agree that aliens are just a myth and they did not build the ""face. Technology has also improved the findings of scientists about he ""face.""

For the most part, scientists are convinced that the theory of aliens building the ""face"" is just a myth. They figure it is just another Martian mesa. The only unusual thing thing about this ""face"" is that there were shadow that give people the illusion that there are eyes, nose, and a mouth. Very few scientists fall for the myth that aliens built the ''face."" Most scientists, including myself, would agree that there is no alien life after all.

Still not satisfied with my argument? If not, listen to this. With all of the new technology these days, there is even more proof as to why there was no aliens who built the ""face."" A camera took photos of the ""face"" with maximum resolution. With the high technology cameras, scientists could look at the photo three times as large as the origianl snapshot. Becasue the scientists can zoom in so much, they would have been able to see if there were any aliens on the planet. The picture actually shows Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa, which are llandforms commonly located around American West.

Most scientists would agree that there never was alien life on Cydonia. Thanks to technology, this point can be proven even further. Obviously, aliens did not build the ""face"" that is on the Red Planet.           ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
6480432E6A80,"Do you believe in aliens? In 1976 the Viking 1 spacecraft of NASA discovered an eery landform that looks like a human face! Some people mainly conspiracy theorist believe it is a sign of extraterestial life on Mars. While scientists like me are finding more and more reasons to explain this strange phenomenom. Today I am only going to explain a few.

The first reason why this ""face"" should be considered a landform and not a sign of life is because it is a huge rock formation that resembles a human head. the facial features: eyes, nose, and mouth are an optical illusion. The reason you see a resemblance of a human face is because the rock casted a shadow of one.

Another reason you should consider this a natural landform is because, these type of landforms are common in the US. An example of these types of landforms is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.

However some alien conspiratists believe that there might have been a chance of alien life. The reason they thought this was because on the second picture the clouds could have been blocking some form of alien markings or monuments. But there weren't any on the third more clearer photograph.

So in conclusion the ""face"" on Mars was a natural landform. It is classified a landform because it is a rock formation. Also, because these types of landforms are common in the US. It should not be classified as a sign of life on other planets becausethere were no alien marking and it is an optical ollusion.             ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
FD918AF59BD3,"The Face on Mars

The Face on Mars is a natural landform.

The formation is just another Martian mesa. Many conspiracy theorists get too overwhelmed when they see this face, because they are so eager for scientsists to find life on another planet. Although it looks as if something made the Face, it was made naturally.

First, the Martian mesa is very common around the area of Cydonia. It was not a big surprise to some scientists to find that it was formed naturally. NASA revealed the image captioning, ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The unusual shadows made the landform seem to be a human face.

Next, the Mars Orbiter Camera team captured a photo that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This made the picture even more accurate. When the picture was first unveiled on a JPL web site, people found that the Face was a naturally landform. It was not caused by aliens or other life forms.

Then, Malin's team took a clearer photo than the 1976 Vikining picture. Malin's team's captured a picture on April 8, 2001, in which each pixel spaned 1.56 meters compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the Viking photograph. According to the article, you can distinctly view objects three times bigger in a digital image than the pixel size. In paragraph 11, the author says ""So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The 2001 picture shows that the Martian is equivalent to landforms that are common near the American West.

Ultimately, the research and pictures were clear, the landform was not made by any life forms. The Face was formed naturally. The Martian mesa is very common in the area of Cydonia, where it was found by. Scientists and their teams captured photos that showed that this was landform was caused naturally. With the technology the scientists like Malin used, it is easy to tell that there was no aliens that affected the mesa.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
C2BC3CD62837,"There has been an argument saying that the face on mars is a ancient civilization. Well they are wrong because it is an old landform. My three reasons of why it is a landform is because the planet Mars cannot support life. Also because it is just the lighting forming the eyes nose and the mouth and it is just a landform. I know it is a landform that has just eroded over hundreds of years.

On Mars there is no oxygen no water or life that is because the planet cannot support life. The planet is compleltly dead. If there was a civlization then they would of had to of built a house with airlocks just to survive. Even if the Aliens did not need air to breath they would have gotten to hot and they need mosture to survive. And you would think that we would have found a civilization or something that would have kept them alive by now. In the text it says it would be cool if there was an ancient civilization.

The landform looks like it has eyes a nose and a mouth but really it is just the lighting reflecting on the landform. If the sun is hitting the landform then it will cause a shadow to creat the look of eyes a nose and a mouth. But after many years the landform has eroded to form a face like look. Sense the planet Mars has allways been the closest to the sun. It is alot hotter than earth so there is allways heat waves so that is what caused the erosen on the landform. In the text it states that the eyes nose and mouth are just an illusion.

This is a landform because the planet is completly dead. Mars cannot support life because it is too hot and it gets heat waves. Also the light refelects off the landform and creats a shadow of eyes a nose and a mouth. The landform has had many years to erode. In the text it states it is just a martian mesa common enough around Cydonia. Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

It would be cool if there was aliens that created the landform. We could see how they adapted to surviving on the planet and its harsh conditions. They might help us addapt to Mars and we can help them adapt to our planet. But NASA would become more famous than what it is today. Because they would want to have all the land marks for artifacts and it would probably make the aliens mad.

The landform on Mars was not created by aliens because we would have known by now. Also because Mars cannot support life the lighting on the planet creats the eyes the nose and the mouth like a illusion. And for all we know it is just a landform. I know it is just a landform that has eroded over hundreds of years. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

NASA thinks aliens made the face because it looks like a face. Studys show that it could be a natural landform like a butte or a mesa just like we have on planet Earth. NASA argues that aliens could be hiding their markings behind a haze. Critics argue that it could be a natural landform. NASA took a photo of the face and it appeared to look like a butte or mesa.

NASA should stop taking photos of the face because they already have enough pictures of the face to look at. In 1976 the took a photo of the face by using Viking 1. Nasa argues that they can get better views when take new photos. critics argue that you dont need that much of photos to figure out what the face is. In 2001 they used the Viking to take a photo of the face and they got back a good photo. It showed that it was a natural landform and it looked like a butte or a mesa.

NASA should stop showing it to the public because they know what the face is, and people dont need to worry about it. The face starred in a Hollywood film, and appeared in books. NASA argues that they need to get the information out to people. Critics argue that people dont need to worry about it and get freaked out about it. The face was on talk shows, checkout lines for 25 years, and in magazines. This shows that the face was out in the public for people to see.

In conclusion NASA is over reacting over this face on mars because they think aliens did it, they been taking alot of photos, and they been showing it to the public.

Don't you think that with our intelligence, we would know if something that looks like alien evidence actually is alien evidence? We would not only let everyone know, but we would make a very big deal out of it. This is just a natural landform.

I know it is silly that there is literally a face on Mars, but it's not as big of a deal as you think. Have you ever looked at the leaves in a tree or the coulds in the sky and seen something put together that resembles an animal or shape? This is kind of like that. It's cool, but it doesn't exactly mean the universe is trying to give you a sign of life. When we released these photos to the public, people thought for sure we were hiding something like we had an agenda to have an alien takeover. They said it was ""bona fide evidence of life on Mars"". Trust me, we wish there was life on Mars! That would be ground-breaking news! We are not hiding a single secret, and we are speaking the truth.

Perhaps, of course, we will find life on the red planet someday. This landform is not evidence to support that moment.

First, If the face-like landform was created by aliens why would that be the only mark? Usually if the face was created by aliens there would surely be a way bigger mark. As well as there would be plenty more marks surrounding that face. This proves that this mark is simply just a landform.

Also, there is plenty of life-like landforms created with the surface of the area. Just so it happens to be on a planet doesn't mean there has to be a wild explanation to this landform. There is life-like landforms that sometimes look a a full body and there are some that look like half of a body. Many of those landforms have been scientifically proven to be just a landform.

Here at NASA we have the equipment to tell us if it is terrestrial or not. One thing we discovered in our research was throughout the years that we have taken these photographs that the ""face"" has started to just look like a big rock. It was due to the shading that the ""face"" looked like it had eyes and a nose.

We also discovered that the rock formation is much like some of the formations here on Earth. All of the Earth formations were caused naturally and not by aliens. The fact that it was a cloudy season when the last picture was taken is true. Although in the picture we can see that it was clear.

In conclusion with all of the facts we have found this is indeed not a face created by aliens. There is enough evidence to tell us this. If it was an alien structure then we would benefit from it.

0FBAA0D3D726,"Three pictures were taken of this odd feature on the land of Mars. The reasoning for the interest of the pictures is because they think the figure of the shape is a face. The first time they saw it they were astonished and had many questions that they sent other spacecrafts to take pictures two other different times. I believe that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a natural formed mound and scientist need to stop listening to theories.

One reason to stop looking for a civilization is because it is not important. Mars Global Surveyor even said that finding the face is hard work itself because we dont even pass over the Face very often. We don't need to wasting our time on something that is not going to affect us here on Earth. Also, after the discovery and the first picture was taken it was just a landform not an alien momument that some people predicted or hoped to be.

Second, if you look at the pictures you see a difference in all three of them. If there was an ancient civilization wouldn't you think the pictures would be more extravagent each time after the first. What we see is the complete opposite of what was just explained. As each picture gets newer the face looks much more deteriorated than before. They face is practically gone by the third picture and there is nothing really of it to say that it was a face.

Lastly, Even if there were airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or things smaller you could see them from the cameras. So don't you think that if there were people on the planet you would also see them as well in the other three photos.

I can see where some people might be interested in the idea of there being people on another planet. It would be awesome to know that you could or can survive on another planet knowing if something happens to the one we are on now. We could even add more information on alien research NASA has been doing.

In conclusion, the Face did turn out to be a mesa and or butte. The same thing as a mesa but a lava dome and just maybe happened to be the same height as the Face on Mars.

It might be even in high definition so that they can see if thats actually a face or if its just a mountain with craters.

Like in the beginning of this article it said that they had take pictures in 1976, 1998, and in 2001 but all of those pictures are on cameras that make pictures blury and in order to see if the picture was actually a face they had to do something to make that picure clearer than it shows. They might argue that im wrong because they might say that why will they need the technology and they might say like well we already have a picture and its a face. But it could possibly be something else. It could be a mountain with craters, it can be mostly anything. I also could be wrong becuase they do have a Mars rover up there so my theory can be wrong and it is a face all along. If I was the a scientist at NASA talking to someone about why the face on mars wasent created by aliens i would tell them that extra terrestrial life couldn't of done that because we dont have enough evidence to prove that they exist. But for now we don't know 100% that aliens did it or if metors hit it and it looked like a face or if aliens did it. And if aliens really did it then we need to get nother camera up there and see if there is any other life out there.

70FA630251FB,"The face wasnt designed by aliens. There isnt any proof that alienseven exsist. The face is an illusion, you have to catch it at the right angle because if you catch it at another angle you ont be able to see it. You can see that aliens didnt make it because when they took the picture in 1998 you couldnt really see the face, but in 2001 you could see it 3 times better than the first one. When taking pictures you always have to get the right angle because either something gets left out or something dosent shows up. If there were any aliens we would have seen them due to the fact that we have spacecrafts taking pictures of it and we have been on the planet ourselves. If aliens did make it why are we just noticing it why didnt we notice it the other times. or better than that why havent we seen any aliens working on it.

827472D8F8A9,"There are always peple saying that aliens are alive and maybe that there is going to be an alien invasion. In 1976, a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) found an image of a peron or as MGS says a ""a Viking photo."" I believe the image of the Viking is just a landform and it wasn't created by aliens. I will explain to you why i think it's a landform.

I believe the image is a just a landform because scientists haven't discovered life yet on mars even though they have found water on Mars. In paragraph 2, the author states, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydnia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah."" I agree with this statement because if the Martian mesa was made again, that means that they will be around for a long time and it will never disappear. The author also states that people think the image or the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. By the looks of the images, I could see that every year they have taken it, I can see that it's disappearing. In the introduction, it says, ""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is is: A mesa."" If people want evidence of aliens or other creatures, they will have to do research on their spare time because scientists have a job to do and they will only do what they are ordered to do. Just to be clear, when they took the photos of the Face on 1976,1998, and 2001, the technology wasn't as advanced as it is today but, if we take a photo of it today, I believe there will probably be another one of the landfoms or probably we might see the Face but just slowly disappearing. These were some of my reasons to argue with to support my belief of the Face being a natural landform.

In conclusion, the image of the Face was just a myth and I will never say it was created by aliens. Aliens aren't even real, that hasn't benn confirmed or said. Not one scientist has said that they have seen a living creature on any planet walking or doing anything. These were just rumors and it can be said as a myth if people want. Based on these reasons, I believe the Face is just a natural landform on Mars.    ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
2C7061AD8E4A,"My name is Proffesor Yado, and my colleague and I were discussing on the infamous ""Face on Mars"". My colleague believes in superstition and conspiracies so he stated that the face on Mars must be of extraterrestrial origin. I said that was porposterous, but my colleague continued to try and convince me to no availe. I told my colleague there are many reasons why the some scientists and people thought the ""Face on Mars"" looked like a face. I then procedded to tell him my reasons.

First off, cameras at the time were not as advanced as they are today. The cameras of the day would ""distort the image and it would only capture the major features of the butte or mesa. The most recent image taken of the ""Face on Mars"" in 2001 looks very different from the original image taken in 1976. If there was a actual structure left by aliens, modern cameras would be able to see it. The the more modern cameras of today are able to see the more defining features of a object.

Secondly humans are remarkably good at seeing faces when there is not one there. When you look at a wall socket you can see what resembles a face when there is not one there. It is the same thing with the ""Face on Mars"". With the aid of shadows from the Sun, are ability to see faces when none are there, and the angle the picture was taken, the butte or mesa looks remarkably like a face or some alien made structure.

In response to what I said my colleague had some things to say to try and disprove me. Due to my colleague believing in superstition and conspiracies he believed NASA and the government are hiding the truth from us. He stated they were hiding this from us because of what happened with H.G. Wells The War of the Worlds, which caused a massive panic. The government don't want another mass panic so they have been keeping us away from the truth that aliens exist. My colleague also stated that possibly alien markings were hidden by haze as some other theorists thing so. I thought that was perpostourous but my colleague still believed the theory of aliens existing.

Even thoug hmy colleague still believes in the ""Face on Mars"" to be a alien made structure. I still believe it's only a butte or mesa. With my evindence of the ""Face on Mars"" only looking like a face due to the techonology of the time, the shadows of the sun, the angle the picture was taken, and our ability to see faces when none are there, I believe I have conclusive evidence that the ""Face on Mars is nothing but a butte or mesa.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
64FDD417A151,"People actually thought that the face on the planet was a sign that there was still life on that planet or an alien monument , and that the NASA was trying to hide the photos alot of people couldn't wait to see the photo of the face .

In NASA we thought that it was created by an alien , because thats what people thought , they thought it was bona fide evidence of life on mars because why would an face just appear out of nowhere it had to be an reason for it . so people thought that it was somebody on that planet or an alien . But people never really thought that it can just be and nartual landform we know that sounds weird because , out of all things why would an face just appear so that had people thinking of weird or different ways it formed or got there .

In all reality that it was just an natural landform some people didn't thought we were lying and just trying to hide how it really got there . Defenders of the NASA budget wished that there was an ancient civililzation on mars so we could really know how it got there . But nobody knew so we had to do more resreach , just to find ou that the face was not an alien or a signal to something like life still on the planet it was just a natrually landform but not everyone was satisfied becasue that was a weird landform . they said that the alien markings were hidden by haze .

When they took a picture with the special camera that shows every little detail .

The picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa , they said thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on mars .

The NASA and all the other groups thought that it was an alien mounument or a sign of life on that planet they never really thought of a natrually land form because it was weird that a face had came out of nowhere on a planet , they had took alot of pictures people thought that nasa was hiding the pictures . they did alot of research just to find out that the face was a natrually land form we already knew , they didnt cause they thought it was weird that a face just pops out of nowhere so everybody thought it was something different but in reality it was just a natrually landform that everybody thought it was something different .

6176ED4EFF53,"That photo is not an alien. What photo am I talking about? The photo the NASA took of the ""face""that is shown in a lot of places. In the arcticle its says,""The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk showseven haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" Lots of people believe it is an alien, but it is not. It is not an alien because it is just a natural land form, it is hard to target(because it never moves, small and blends in with all the rest of noraml mars), and people say it looks like a normal natural lava dome (and it does).

It is just a natural land from. It is only shaped like a face. There is nothing odd or strang about it besides the shaping. It just happened to look like a face. In the texts it says, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This shows it had nothing to so with aliens, it was just a land form.

If it was a living thing, or used to be living shouldn't move around?Its not easy to target Cydonia, says Garvin. This shows it is one spot and small. It also proves it blends in like in other natural land form would do. If it was something special you would think it would be easier to find. If you don't look very closly you don't even see the face at all.

Not only is it natural land, but it is also reminds Garvin of a lava dome of Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. This again proves if you ignore the fact that it looks like a face, it looks completely normal. It looks like a normal thing any planet would have, even earth.

Some may agrue it looks to much like a face to not be something like an alien. Even though it is funny how much it looks like face, there are too many facts proving it isn't anything different from everything else on the planet mars. It just happened to be the way it formed it looked like a face.

There are many things proving, this thing on Mars is not an alien or created by aliens. First, it is just like anyother land form, just a ""werid"" shaping. Second, it blends in, is small and doesn't move. (This makes it hard to target.) Finally, it reminds people of a lava dome, again showing it is just shaped weird to us. The face got the attention of the public for a while, like the text said,""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" But, everyone needs to let it go because it is nothing to talk about since we now know the truth. It was fun for a while, but if you still believe it more than a normal part of mar's natural land, you will look like a fool.

C9D0C8653C63,"As a scientist at NASA, I know that this ""face"" found on Cydonia is just a natural landform that makes the shadow of a human face. Natural landforms often make shadows when light hits it at a certain angle. This causes the shadows to form things like faces, animlas, or other things. For example, when Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, taking photots of possible landing sights for its sister ship Viking 2, it spotted a shadow likely to be of a humans face. The shadow made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Some scientists think that the ""face"" could also have been an alien artifact. That may be possible but, its more likely to be a shadow caused by the formation of he land.

0B58C8B94F19,"The conspiracy about there being life on the moon in this article is not correct. For someone to claim there is life anywhere but the planet Earth needs to provide evidence. Providing evidence is not just having a theory with people backing you up. Evidence is providing proof, proof is pictures lab tests and finding all possiblities that that is the only thing it could be. The article however cannot provide proof or hardly any evidence there are living things on Mars.

The article does provide a picture, but the picture is nothing but a mear misunderstanding. The picture provided is what is called a lava dome, simply shapes creating the form of a face. People like to take little things and make them into something just because they can. Many people are making a large amount of money off of this discovery and that's what people are after now, people care about money and publisity. This scientific breakthrough is nothing but a scam really.

People want to believe what they hear and so most of the time they will. Things can be photoshopped now a days with all the new technology so I suppose you can never know for sure. New discoveries are scary and scientists will keep on discovering the world and even whats outside of our world but there's no gaurentee this is a real ailen artifact. Things form together and make random shapes, this shape on Mars just so happened to be a face, big deal that doesn't mean anything.

Angle is everuthing, angle can make something look like it actually isn't, it plays tricks on your mind and your eyes.

The only reason that they think it was aliens because everyone around the world always talk about how aliens live on mars! You can tell by how the face looks like that it is a human face. The reason that make it look like an alien face because of how long it had been there for,and that was about twenty years,and also that its covered up with rocks and dirt.

But to let you know that its not a person that aliens had created,because if you look at paragraph seven that Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC), took good,very sharp picture of it,it revealed . . . a natural larmform.

That it was no alien monument after all. But they had to get more evidence to really make sure that it was a ordinary human and that was not created by aliens because lots of people belive was not satisfie,and actually belive that it was created by humans.

So whe they look back at it they discover somthing, they discoverd that it was a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. And thats what had lead people to know that it was landform human face.     ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
62CF0CE1297D,"How do you think the Face was formed. There could be many reasons how the Face was formed. However I think that the Face was not formed by aliens. One reason is, is that they haven't prove that aliens are real yet. Also, that the day they took they picture they said that there was wispy clouds over it. Another reason is that it all happend because of science.

Mars is an odd planet, I've heard people call it the pizza planets because it was red, I think. That's not the point though, the point is, is that the planet has not proven that aliens live on that planet. The face had been thought it was created by aliens. NASA said that the Face was a ""huge rock formation"" showing the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. There are more reasons why they face was Face was not formed by aliens.

Another reason is that the day they took the picture, there was wispy winds. In order to take a good picture you need to have good weather. The weather can effect the picture because if it's windy you need to make sure that everything is not blowing around. The wispy winds could have effected the picutre becuase the winds were blowing so the rocks, sand and everything else was blowing around. So, when Viking 1 captured that picture, it can everything else blowing with it. Wind storms happen on planets, I am not sure om which ones but i know they happen-just like how on the sun it doesn't have wind storms but has almosr like volcanic action on it with lave everywhere. There is one more other reason.

One more reason is that is just plain old science. Science occurs in a lot of discussing and working on the planet. When planning to send some sort of machine to a planet, you have to undertand the planet. In 1976 there wasn't the best technology at the time. They didn't know when a storm was gonna come or if they would have to send their machines threw a bunch of metors. When they sent out Viking 1 a win storm occured and the camera on Viking 1 couldn't focus right and that is why it looked like a face.

There are many more reasons why the Face was not formed but an aliens. Some are that it was that aliens have not been proven yet. Also, that there was wispy clounds. One more is that is was all science. Those are resons why that the Face was not formed by aliens.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

It may aslo be a feture that is only unique to this palnet like the moon has thousands of craders. I just feel as if Earth has all the water and green grass on it mayb Mars has these land forms instead. Also it might be like how people gaze at the stars or the clouds to see if they make an object or a human face. If you look closley you can see that the

In hopes of debunking this suspicion, I am hoping you will read through my provided evidence that supports my claim that this ""face"" was not created by aliens.

First off, NASA would not be trying to hide the existence of aliens from the public. Their budget is primarily based on the tax and donation of those who are interested in space. If aliens were to exist, and NASA knew this, telling the public would give their budget a massive increase. So, to dismiss the accusation that NASA is hiding proof of evidence from you, I assure you that they would have told us just to get the much needed rise in their budget.

The picture of the ""face"" was taken forty years ago, just seven years after we first landed on the moon. As stated in the article, this was, in fact, the best resolution they could take the picture with. If you put two and two together, you can conclude that the highest resolution at the time was not very high at all compared to modern day photos.

Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars was taken in 1976. The camera's absolute maximum was 43 meters per pixel. By looking at the photograph, you wouldn't be able to make a definate conclusion about what exactly the figure was and how it got on the surface of Mars.

The ""face"" on Mars has been a topic of discussion for almost twenty-five years. Was it created by an unknown species of aliens? Definitely not. Although, some people do think that, the ""face"" on Mars is actually just a natural landform that happened to be shaped like a face. Obviously, the ""face"" on Mars is a natural landform, not something created by aliens.

To begin, the ""face"" on Mars is just a natural landform. What else could it be? Some say it was a statue built by aliens. But, that can't possibly be true. There is no proof that aliens exist in the first place, so how could a species that doesn't exist build a statue? Also, NASA released information saying that it was just a huge mesa forming into the shape of a face. The shadows just give it the illusion of eyes and a nose. Finally, the pictures of the ""face"" obviously show that it is not a built structure. It is just a natural landform on Mars. The pictures get clearer each time they were taken, so it is very apparent that the ""face"" is just a huge formation of rocks. So, all of this shows that there is no possible way that the ""face"" on Mars was built by aliens.

Although, I do understand why people could believe the ""face"" was built by aliens. It does look like it could be a monument, like the ancient Egyptians built for their people. However, life does not exist on Mars; therefore, the ""face"" could not be built by aliens. Also, some people think that aliens do exist on mars, and that NASA is just hiding it. But, why would NASA hide that they found an alien civilization? That could only help the company, not hurt them. And, if you still don't believe me, if there were aliens on Mars, wouldn't we be able to or have seen them by now? Once again, I say that the ""face"" on Mars is just a mesa that gives the illusion of a face, not a statue built by creatures that don't exist.

In conclusion, the ""face"" on Mars is just a natural landform, not something that was created by aliens. In the future, we might find out for certain what that ""face"" is.

287ED74F757B,"Have you seen the ""Face on Mars""? If so, do you believe it is natural or created by alien activity? Many people believe the face is evidence of alien life however this is probably not the case. The Mars Global Surveyor ,a mapping spacecraft, has passed over the area few times. However the few times it has passed over there has been no evidence of any form of alien civilization. This led us to believe it is just a natural landform.

This all began when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting Mars. Viking 1 was snapping photos of possible landing sites for his sibling Viking 2. In the midst of doing so Viking 1 spotted what looked like a human face. This was extraordinary because it was on planet Mars! When the images were leaked it led the public to believe that this is evidence of life outside of Earth's atmosphere.

This might not be the case however. NASA believes that the face is just a natural landform similiar to a butte or mesa on that of Earth. There was a lot more evidence pointing towards the side of NASA but that didn't put peoples hopes down. Some of the public hoped and believed this was in some shape or form, evidence of extraterrestriel life.

The pictures of the ""Face on Mars"" that NASA had were actually kind of foggy. They were foggy because the Mars Global Surveyor had to get the photos through clouds. This then led people to believe that NASA was hiding something in the fog. They thought they were hiding the evidence of life. NASA, however wanted to show them this was not the case.

NASA then ,a few years later, passed over the face on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, and rolled the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. NASA eventually captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. This photo cleared up a lot of confusion.

As NASA studied the photograph, they came to realize that the Face was in fact caused by natural means. They then leaked the image to the public and cleared up confusion there too. However, there will always be that group of nay sayers. This group still wanted to believe that the ""Face on Mars"" was evidence of alien life. They still might believe that to this day.

The ""Face on Mars"" has caused a lot of confusion and mystery in the world. Many believed it was natural from the beginning and others not so much. Some have even grown to believe it was natural other than caused by aliens. Of course there are people still on both sides and as of right now we will never completely know the truth.

Many people think that Mars has life living on it. One example would be the two mile long landform, the Face. People have been wondering for years what this odd shaped landform is, could it be an alien statue or just a natural landform. The Face is not an alien formation, but a natural landform.

When NASA sent Viking 1, in 1976, to photograph Mars. They took images of the landscape there and stumbled upon a newly forming mesa or butte. Once NASA brought the images back and analyzed them. They found that the Face was nothing more than a Martian mesa with unusual shadows that made it look like a face.

Then, in 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over the region again. They snapped several pictures of it, at a ten times higher resolution, I might add, and analyzed these new images. They finally put their images on the internet and revealed to the world, that the Face was nothing more than a natural landform.

Finally, in 2001, NASA sent Mars Global Surveyor a second time to photograph the Face. The team at NASA used the highest possible resolution to photograph this controversial piece of Mars. They found that the picture shows the, ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa,"" which are are also found in the American West. NASA's chief scientist for the Mars Exploration Program says,"" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

Some people think that the Face provides evidence for life on Mars becasue NASA could not get a good shot of it. They do have a point that it would be hard to get a clear image of the Face with challenging weather. Yet, NASA has proven over and over again that the Face is nothing more than a natural formation.

The Face is nothing more than a natural landform and not an alien formation. Scientists found that is was a Martian mesa but the unusual shadows made it look like a face. NASA also found that it was nothing more than a natural landform and the Face looks very similar to buttes or mesas here on earth. Others think that NASA could not have gotten good pictures because of the weather, but NASA has proven that the Face is just a natural landform. The Face is just a strange piece of Mars and not a symbol of alien history.   ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
8EB905FB00AD,"So you think that the land formation coincedentally 'a face' created by the weathering. Proves to be a significant amount of source to say there were aliens or a civilation. One thing will not prove anything there are no signs of homes or even indented marks of other species being there only this simple marking. Well i beg to plead the opposing side see what you have seen from 1976,1998, and 2001 is technology has proccesed this and its clearly nothing but a mark. Your conspiracy will live on if this was a life form why would it only be one life form? where are the others there are no trace of them a form of life can not just be created by nothing it has to reproduce. There is only sign of one so there for it does not exist as of the evidence given it is simply just a mesa, a mesa is a rock formation.

this is just a coincedence that it looks of so nasa revealed they wish there was life form to give us more to study of but not much evidence comes from a plain old rock that looks like a face. in conclusion you personally will not change your mind about this becuase it a conspiracy life has been held up by this making money off of this rejoicing of nothing but a rock. Just like area 51 another conspiracy theorys where there is claimed to be unexposed life form when really its just a testing site for us millitary. Also the illumanati claimed to be the ones running the music industry and society. there many conspiracy theorys, but maybe just maybe theyare controlling us of what they dont want us to know making people think the conspiracys are a joke when in reality they are true.

C8F903603634,"On May 24, 2001, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling around Mars while taking photos of possible landing sites. As it was taking photos, it noticed a dome that resembled a human face. The face was nearly two miles in diameter and it appearded to be staring back at the cameras from an area of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Some say that this is evidence of life on Mars.

In paragraph 2, they tell us that the sensation was short lived. It also says that scientists assumed it was just another Martian Mesa because it was so common around Cydonia. This one had shadows that made is look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. They should not have came to the conclusion that there is life on mars only becuase they saw shadows that resembled a humans facial structure.

In paragraph 7, it states that on April 5, 1998,

Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took photos that would come out 10 times sharper than the original Viking photos. The photos revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument. If there really was an alien monument to begin with, it surely would have appeared the second time around, especially because they used a much better camera.

In paragraph 12, it says that the picture actually shows a Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa, which is a landform that is common around the American West. Garvin states that it reminds him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That is a lava dome that is about the same height as the Face on Mars.

The Face on Mars is most likely a natural landform. Martian mesas are common around the Cydonia area so it could have easily been mistaken for what appeared to be a human face. They claim to have seen evidence of life based on shadows that appeared on a natural landform. This seems very unrealistic. Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera team took photos using a camera that would leave pictures 10 times sharper than the orginal Viking pictures, so if anything was actually on Mars, we surely would have seen it.

7C2974EB31DD,"If i was a scientist at NASA and had to do research on of the face that is on mars i would say it isnt a human face. I think it is just a natural landform.

My evidence that the face is not really a human being is first of all it doesnt even have a body. Since they took pictures of the face, they could have croped the pictures to look real. In the pictures that scientists took of the face in 1976 to 2001 the pictures look nothing like a face. The pictures show cracks that may appear to look like a face but really isnt.

When a scientist was taking a picture on mars he noticed an enormous head nearly two miles from one end to the other end and it seemed that it was staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called cyndonia. The cause of that could have been a shadow and not a human looking back at him. Another thing is that i dont think they seen a Martian because when they said that they had pictures of a Martian, picture cant always be true because of how people crop pictures today.

Even though Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, it did shoot a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.

2E4427B65439,"NASA. The United States form of a dominating space academy. The Viking 1, was in fact NASA's spacecraft that was launched in 2001. The spacecraft was set course for the small, red planet that is simillar to Earth. The planet is called Mars. Viking 1's ""sister"" Viking 2 was supposed to be landing on Mars, and that's why Viking 1 was sent up in space to begin with. While Viking 1 was snapping photos, its camera picked up a weird face-like structure on the surface of Mars. Some believe its a mysterious face that ""so called aliens"" built. I believe that their reasoning is just a bunch of garbage. What I think that is, is just a simple and natural landform made by the underground volcanoes, sandy surface, and rocks that landed there.

One reason I believe that this is a natural landform is from looking at the photos. The ""face"" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.

That part of the theory makes more sense if you take into consideration the angle the camera could have been taken at. Notice photo two? Its seems to be taken at an angle where there looks like there is a small mountain range looming over the rest of the area. This is key evidence explaining how this is just a natural landmark on Mars.

If you still do not believe me, then this next part will. If you think about it, why would NASA keep an amazing discover like this a secret? The answer is that they would not. If NASA went worldwide with their ""face"" they would make more money than millionaires or even other space academies. It does not make sense that the academy would keep an alien encounter hidden.

In conclusion, NASA is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their ""face"", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not. Therefore; This ""so called face"" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

first, in the story it says"" its's not as easy to target Cydonia"". This mean its not as easy just to pop up and see it. meaning theres a possiblity thats not it because it wouldn't of been that easy to find.

Second, most scientists think it was an alien. In the story it says"" Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at tge REd PLanet in sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the viking missionsended"". which means they never know what it is it can be a alien or an face but most likely just an alien in their case.

Last , you dont just see pass the face any other time. As it says in the story ""We dont just pass over the face very often"". With that being said its not some you can just see any minute its maybe once out of a blue moon or your just lucky.

No one know how it become a human face or if it a human face at all, and some think the reason behind it is that there are evidence showing live in Mars. I agree that the shape is a human face shape, but I also believe is just a landform. The reason is that as it stated in the article, the face is to attrack the people. As Technology improved, the picture are showing the real image of the face which reveal to change it shape.

The first reason to support my claim is that the face is use to attrack people, so that the people who made up the idea can earn the money. According to paragraph three it said that,""huge rock formation.. which resembles a human head... formed by shadowss giving the illusion of eyes,nose and mouth."" Following the evidence is that also on paragraph three it say,"" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to enage the public and attract attention to Mars."" This evidence tell me that with the idea of having a human face in Mars, it allowed people to think and believe what they told them.

On paragraph twelve, Garvin say that,"" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""The second reason is that the face was due to a land form. The evidence not only gave me the idea of how it was form, it also give me the idea of how it reminded them of the a real life thing happen in the United State. We can already agree with this evidence that the idea of the formation for a human face was due to landforms. Also when in a different planet landform are still the same as the earth by how the land change.

There may be live in Mars, and no one know that is true. In any case the Face of Mars might looked like a real human face, but if you look closely at the face that viking take in 2001, it doesn't look like a face. In the picture it show how the landform change it, and that the reason for why there are no Face in Mars. This argument will show you why the Face of Mars is just any landform like you see in earth.                  ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
0FD4EC19268F,"Myths. Fables. Tall tales. What do they mean to you? People just want to believe things that are not true. Some may say NASA is just not wanting to tell people about the Face that was created by the aliens, but NASA claims that it is not true. The Face found on Mars cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence that it is extraterrestrial life; however, some may say that in fact there is no real evidence and the Face looks like an actual face. All in all, the Face is just like any other natural landform.

Strangley, the author of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars""

suggests that the season changing might have affect on the Face that was found on Mars. To clarify, in the text the author states that in April of the year 1998, it was the middle of winter in Mars. The author also explains this was ""a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet,"" referring to Mars. By this strange thought, the author is trying to explain that the landform might have just looked like a face through both the clouds and the winter being in full swing. Although, several years later, scientists returned on to take a closer look at the Face with newer technology and to find a better view with the clouds being gone. At this point in time, scientists found that the Face was the size of normal land form that would exist on Earth.

Ultimately, the Face is the size of what a normal land form on Earth would be. In the text, the author stated, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" What the author is trying to explain is landforms including volcanos, some mountains, and rock sculptures (like Mt. Rushmore) are about the same size of the Face. Chances that the Face is just a landform is extremelly likely. If you truely think about it, what creature is as big as even just George Washington's face on Mt. Rushmore?

All in all, there is no ""true"" evidence that the landform was a real face or creature. There is no recorded history of the face moving. Also, what ""face"" is the size of man made Mt. Rushmore? In the text, the author states, ""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" The author is trying to explain that technology has grown with the landmark, and a sharper picture actually reveals an alike picture of the landform that had no sign of any life. The author explained in the text that the high resultion camera was so strong that pyramids, airplanes on the ground, or even the small shacks that you see when you drive down the interstate were crystal clear. This means that the Face had to have been landforms that one person might have mistaken for life on another planet.

On the other hand, some may also say that they is no proof. The Face could just as well be life on another planet, but there is no true evidence to prove so. In fact, scientist have came up with more ways that the Face is not life rather than if it was. For instance, in the text the author stated, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West,"" and, "" Michael Malin and his MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform."" With all this said, the Face could have a slight chance of being real life; however, it is highly unlikely that it is true life on another planet.

Ultimately, the Face shown on Mars is just a nautral landform. The Face cound just be the seasons changing, it is the size of a natural landform, and there is no actual true evidence.

This landform was created by natural causes; saying that it was created by a differrent lifeform is irrelavent. It's irrelavent because NASA would have a higher budget than we do now to explore further, if you take a look at the pictures the three are very distinct, and the third photo didn't show any other landforms, pyramids, houses, or lifeforms.

NASA's budget is assgined to them by the new discoveries they find in outter space. If there were alien life on planet Mars we would've told the public, federal government, etc. because we want that extra money to discover more about it. Why would just hold on to that secret. We took a pictures of the landforms lets see how they turned out.

As we compare the pictures of the same landform there are many differences. The 01' picture we took has multiple cracks and craters in the monument. I'm pretty sure the aliens wouldn't bulid a monument some place it could get beat up at. The 76' and 98' pictures were captured with not too good of a camera, causing it to have the appearance of a face.

In 2001, we had created a camera with the highest camera quality we were able to obtain. We researched and studied on the camera itself to see that each pixel was 1.56 meters instead of 43 like the other cameras. We came to the conclusion that we would be able to see any other landforms, lifeforms, ships, etc. ,but all of the above are absent.

The people who do think that this is an alien made landform have not done as much of the research to figure it out, since they do not have the same high technology equiptment that NASA has. Many people think that the Face was made by aliens, but I believe that it is naturally formed, and it just happens to look like a face.

There is no real evidence stating that aliens are real, or that they have ever existed. There has been research done, but no clear evidence that they are real, leading to the conclusion that most people think that they are not real. The Face, to some researchers, looks like what is similar to a mesa or butte. This is a natural landform that looks like a landform you would typically find around the American West. The differences in the pictures over the years help explain why the Face is not alien made.

The pictures over the years change gerastically. In 1976, the picture is pretty blurry, looks smooth, and almost resembles a face on a statue. In 1998, the picture looks a little more like itself, a little rougher, and it does not resemble a face as much as the first picture. Lastly, the picture in 2001 looks more like a landform and is a little rough, but it is a much clearer picture than the other two. The last picture still resembles a face almost, but I believe that that is just a coincidence. NASA did plenty of research on the Face.

NASA has done a lot of research on the Face to prove if there is life on Mars or not. The Face was found by one of NASA's spacecrafts called the Viking 1, which was taking pictures of possible landing spots for the other spacecraft, Viking 2. They let the picture out to the public, which got really popular really fast. The Face was really popular for 25 years! After those 25 years, they decided to get a better picture of the face. The picture turned out to be ten times sharper than the original photos. The pictures showed that the photo was a landform. Some of the scientists were not satisfied, and had to get a better photo, which still showed that the Face was just a landform.

The Face was a natural landform on Mars that happened to look like a face. Although many believe that it was created by aliens, the evidence shows that it is just a landform. The three pictures that were taken help compare and tell us why it was not alien made. There is no evidence stating that aliens are real, so it is not a valid conclusion to state that aliens created the landform.

13E2AB835DE1,"Unidentified Object

Scientific observations at NASA leads us to belive that the theory of an alien face on mars is fake. The idea that the object is anything more than a natural mesa on the planet is not backed up by proven facts.

Theories of the mesa on mars actually being some sort of alien face or object have no proof. NASA has refrenses from our own planet to compare the object to, and high-resolution camers to photograph the object. While skeptics on the other hand, have nothing more than thier own personal beliefs. Unfortuianly the rest of NASA and other people in general belive otherwise.

After researching the landform it saows resemblence of a mesa. The ""face"" actually had the researchers think of formations in the American West that would become a type of dome shape that would form from lava. That theory has a decent amount of real life facts compared to the alien theory. So far that is the best theory NASA has on what the object is.

In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" whilst reading throught the fifth paragraph, they quote that defenders of NASA's budget wish there was an ancient civilation on Mars. This made me wonder why they would think that. It's because it would be more than just a landform like a mesa. They would have more to look into than just a face looking terrain. But being scientists they realized it was not as much as they'd hoped for. Therefore having no reason to lie about the mesa.

However putting myself in the shoes of a person who wouldn't know about all these facts or opinions, I could see why these beliefs are taken seriously. But that's why we have researchers like NASA. To look into theories with more knowledge behind them and see how they turn out afterwords.

Some might think one thing is special effects, others will think it is real. In Unmasking the Face on Mars, the author explains controversy of the ""face"" found on Mars' surface. It became an icon once it was released to the public. It was highlighted for decades and the society argued over it being an alien making, or just a land form called a mesa. The face was just a natural landform and it shouldn't have been thought as an alien form.

The most logical answer to this was that it was a mesa, and that the shadows on the surface happened to make it look like a human face of an egyptian pharaoh. This struck civilization in the late 70s and caused a lot of arguments. The people that thought is actually was an alien structure were just people of the press who just wanted attention.

Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared an a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This quotes directly states and gives evidence that it is just a natural landform.

There isn't even any true or logical evidence that the face on Mars was an "" alien artifact."" It was just a rumor that went around to keep things interesting and intrigue big movie companies. The cameras even took a picture with a ten times better resolution than the 1976 picture of the face. In addition, the new picture even had each pixel in the image span 1.56 meters in comparison to the original 43 meters per pixel. Garvin talks that "" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" and that "" if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" Garvin directly states here that no matter what, the formation couldn't have possibly been an alien formation or even a pyramid. This is even more proof that it is ridiculous to think that the formation was an "" alien making .""

Although the face was thought to be alien, there is too much evidence that denies it, and that it isn't. Scientists would wish that it was an extra terrestrial sign, but the odds of that are too scarce to even consider. This was a very controversial topic, as I have stated before.

This evidence gives even further support that it isn't extra terrestrial, and states that it isn't, shich exposes that it is a fluke.

The face on Mars was an ongoing argument for years to come once it was released to the public. There was no reason to do so. There was already valid points that gave proof of it being just a mesa. Things like this occurence happen all the time, even in your daily life. If things like this run across your mind, think about it the logical way and not a very, very unlikely path about it.

The first photo we had of the Face on Mars was taken in 1976 by Viking 1, which would not have had the most advanced cameras.

Though some people believed the Face was an alien artifact, this theory is disproved quickly because in truth the Face on Mars is just a mesa. The Face on Mars is in the area of Mars known as Cydonia. Cydonia is known for having lots of Martian mesas. Martian mesas are very similar to mesas or buttes found in the American West. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program Jim Garving quotes, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Which is a lava dome the takes the form of an isolated mesa, and is approximately the same hight as the mesa known as the Face on Mars.

Though some theorists still believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, it turns out to be just a Martian equivalent of a mesa. This is proved true by the advanced camera quality, the proof that it was just shadows creating the illusion that the Face on Mars was actually a face, and the fact that the Face has been confirmed to just be a mesa.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

How can you believe that the face on Mars was aliens? it is obviously just another landform of Mars'. Here, i'll go through some evidence that it is just a landform.

First of all, landforms like that are common in Cydonia. Also, keep in mind that appearances can be decieving. You can even see a similar landform right by the ""face"". And plus, there is no scientific evidence of life on another planet, let alone Mars. Simply stating that a haze could've hid the ""alien"" markings is hardly a compelling argument.

Second off, The photo they took in 2001 proves even further that it just a normal martian messa. and accourding to the article that have read, ""you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" if you want to check this article out, you can find that information in paragraph 11. so if there were any alien objects, you could both see what they were and even know what they were.

I think i have proven my point. so don't even try to argue that, you will not succeed. i know that you might say, well NASA is just lying. My response is that if you had the money to afford a satellite and you sent there, with the current high grade cameras, you would find that you were wrong all along. so yes I win this argument, and that the ""face"" on Mars is just a messa.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Is it still possible for there to be aliens on the planet, maybe. We could go back to the planet and see if there is any evidence of alien life forms now.

The face on Mars is formed from wind blowing dirt and sand around, pileing it up and packing it together. Now it just so happened that it managed to form a face with eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Now is this a strnge thing to have happen, yes it is indeed but it still happened all on its own. If we were to go and look at the photots you would see that there are no footprints or anything aroun the face, there is just the face.

Unless the alien life forms are living beneath the planet there are no aliens. Is it possible for aliens to be living underneath the ground of the planet, yes it is possible. For all we know there could be aliens living underneath the crust of our planet.

7CE58A7E90FD,"These photo's that were taken by NASA are rock formations. These photos were taken in 1976, 1998, and in 2001. People thought that the formations were from other living things that are on Mars. Nasa took several pictures of these rock formations because they were shaped like humans. The rock formations starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even ended up in haunted grocery store checkot lines for 25 years.

Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. After taking several more photographs of these landforms people started to realize that they were natural landforms and not made by other living things.

NASA put the photots on JPL web sites so that people could see these pictures up close. Few cientisct thought that these artifacts were made by aliens. When NASA first took a picture of these faces they said that the face was staring back at the camera. They looked like Egyptian Pharaoh's.

There was no alien monument after all. The pictures actually show a butte or a mesa landforms comman aroiund the American West. These are natural landforms becuase scientitst say that there is no life on Mars. NASA took pictures in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.

71FD8098572A,"Have you ever just wondered if there could be life somewhere else from earth?

If so then how about the face that they found on mars. Many people dont agree that it's just landform that built it's self up and just happened to resembul a face. Others would disagree and say that it is just land and that shodows were the main purpose of the enitre thing that made it look like a face. Why did the face on mars not look the same in 1976 i looked like a smilly face at first.

When the picuture was taken it was taken in many different angles. That shows that there is a posability that the picture that they took at the time was in a way that made it have shadows an some sides. The camara that took it could have been faceing in the direction that the sun was shining and got some of the light make shadows on the landform.

The scientist that looked at the picture taken by Viking 1 says it was only landform shaped in different ways. Makeing it appear like something that is not really there. Garvin says that it remindes him of a lava dome around the America West it's about the same height as the face that they found on mars.

When they first took a picture of the face in 1976 it looked nothing like a face it only looked like a smily face and even that was hard to tell. After a couple of years in 1998 in looked like an oval shaped box and it was sunken in. And in 2001 is when started to shape into something over the years in changed and over more years it will change even more. After that and so on because that's just what landforms do they change but, you can't always see the same thing you sole once.

I can see why some people don't see why it could be a landform And that its actually something else it does look like a face .it could actually be a statue and not just land shaped in to something but the thing is of it was really a statue or remaines of something or someone But,then why wouldn't it looks fuler or have actuale face there would be bones. And if there was a statues then why is it only it's head you would a lest find the other parts of the statue but we haven't and that's because it only a land form shaped into something almost everyone beleives to be actuale life.

In conclution that object that was found on mars is only land built up that looks some what like a face and not a statue or remains of a living person or creature. but something that was a different landform a long time ago before it became what is know as the face on mars.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
6848515B048E,"Switching Sides

Have you ever heard of the man on the moon? Well Mars has a similar thing. They both ,at the time, had formations that looked like human faces. Some think it was made by aliens or some other superior being. However, the reality of it is that its just a natural formation that looks like a face. That part can be nocked out when you zoom up on it. The lines and basic formation of the mesa,the face, are too natural to be made by an intelligent species. Finally, if there was some marks or sign that it was created by aliens it would have shown up on the image due to the high resolution. We are looking farther then we should with this natural formation.

At the moment the most recent picture from 2001 completly exterminates any facial recognition. You can see natural lines that run across the mesa and the higher elevation of certian areas. The eyes are just a steep hill that geos to the top. While the mouth seemingly isn't even there anymore. You can see the worn away parts indicating that its been there for quite awhile. The shadows aren't even there at the time which creates the distictive features. It bearly even looks like a face anymore.

I was talking about the NATURAL lines that appear on the mesa. The lines on the mesa are to distictive to be created. If something made it they would have wanted smooth edges as well as an even ditch. If they tried to recreate the natural look it would have looked faulty and unbeliveable. The species would have completly deformed the hill exposing its true colors. Also what reason would they have for creating a random face with the possibility of no one ever seeing it. There is no point to it.

Finally, the final reason for it not being alien-made is if there was marking on the mesa giving reason to believe it was created be aliens they would have been shown. If any wierd symbols showed up on the screen we would have seen it and still release the image. Why would we hide this from the world if it would increase the amount of funding we get from companies. You can study the image for hours, but not find a single symbol anywere on the image. The camera would have picked it up and we would have studied it.

The mesa was not created by aliens if only looks that way to us because are minds are hardwired to find faces. Its much easier to remember a face rather than a name. Everything about the image is natural it wasn't put there for some unnoticable reason that we can't comprehend. It just existis thats all... nothing more nothing less. No aliens had anything to do with this mesa. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
D63614D8E957,"In 1976, a remarkable natural landform was discovered on Mars, a land form known now as, The Face. Scientist have debated on whether The Face is a natural landform or created by an ancient civilization on Mars. I believe this is really just a natural landform, and the reason I believe this is because of recent evidence. Reasons why I support this are, in 1976 picture quality wasn't as advanced as it is today and, this rock formation is similar to ones that occur on Earth.

The Face, a huge rock formation, at nearly two miles long. This face like formation is also known as Cydonia. Cydonia in the mid 70's was thought to be a strange landform built by aliens. Although, really it's like any other naturally occuring landform on Earth. According to the artical ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" In the new updated picture of The Face, it is clearly seen as a land formation, not done by aliens.

Then in 1976 picture of Cydonia was not as advanced as it is today. In the 2001 pictures, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 photo."" This quote from paragraph 10 explains that, the picture power was very noticable different in the photograph from 1976 than 2001. This means that the pictures from 1976 are not reliable because of the poor pixel quality. Proving that The Face is just a natural landform.

On April 5th, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor traveled to Mars and flew over Cydonia for the first time. These photos were said to be ""...ten times sharper than the original Viking photos,"" according to the artical.

So on that day in 1998 people tuned in to find out the real truth. A quote from paragraph 7 in the artical states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waitng when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform."" In the end, it turns out that there was really no alien monuments.

In conclusion, my claim is that The Face is just a naturally occuring landform. First, are Earth landforms that are similar, called mesas. Next, pictures took in 1976, are outdated and have poor pixel quality. Lastly, since April 5th, 1998 there are pictures proving that The Face is just a natural landform. Therefore making my claim true, The Face on Mars is nothing but a natural landform.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

I think my statement is correct because, what else would it be. It is an old face grounded into Mars. It proves there is life on Mars even though it could poswsibly be an alien. It is either a human being or alien possibly inside of this planet with their face sticking out perminately. This suspicious face could be anything that was alive at one point. there probably isnt any life on Mars because the photograph was taken from an airship. So it it most likely an alien. If it was a human, he probably died instantly.

my inference now is it is an alien. because, the face was located 41 degrees north martian latitude. The face seems to be in a very random spot to be seen. My inference is it is an alien. however you never know

Now i personally think it is or was an alien. the face looks very plain and in a random spot for a human to roam. the altitudes have no life on them, Mars has no life on it.

B0D9B3EA4E5A,"On May 24, 1976, NASA's Viking one spacecraft was circling mars. It took many photos of landing sites for its sister ship Viking two. As viking one took pictures, it came across a pecuiliar formation on the surface of the planet. The formation seemed to be an enormouse head similar to that of a humans. The scientist figured it was just another Martioan mesa, that was commonly spread throught the surface of Mars.

Conspiracy theorists think that it is bona fide evidence that there is life on Mars. Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acncient civilization on Mars. And so on April 5, 1998 another Mars global surveyor flew over and took a picture ten times sharper than the original photos. This led the the scientist to conclude and reveal that the face was just a natural land form and that it wasn't an alien monument at all.

Some people were not happy. The face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north of the martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. This was a coudy time of year on Mars. They had said that the camera the pictures had been taken with had to peer through clouds to see the Face. They believed that the alien markings were hidden by the haze at the time.

On April 8, 2001, there was a cloudles day on Mars. The surveyor drew close for another picture. They said they increased the image quality to take the best picture they had taken of the face. They added that in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixle size you could see things like airplains, egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks.

This showed people that it was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. This showed that the conspiracy theorists had been proven wrong. Since NASA actually researches theier data to learn more about it and they make hypothesize, it shows that they have a lot of since in saying that theorists are wrong. Theorist just make theories and they don't have anything to back them up if someone were to arugue about the subject.

B68A2726F120,"Many years ago there was said to be a face on mars. Research since have proved that the so called face was just a natural landform. There are such landforms like a mesa that the scientists think is what the face really is. People today still do not believe scientists that the so called face is just a landform. I think people should believe that its a natural landform, because scientists have improved their cameras, scientists know more on the topic then civilians do, and people assumed and over exaggerated too quickly.

Scientists have improved there pictures since the Viking 1 took the photo. They have better quality and have done some more research. The aricle says that there cameras have improved and been upgraded. The scientists say that there are several options that the mound could be. Two options are a mesa and a butte.

The people do not know as much as the scientists do. The scientists have done research and gone to school over this type of thing. They can identify it easily. In the article one said that the landfrom looks common to some in the American West. They compared it to the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This shows that the people have less knowledge in this area then scientists do.

People over exaggerated it when they first found out anyway. They weren't positive that it was what they thought it was. The aritcle stated that right away people made movies, stories, and articles about it. The picture shows on the Viking 1 that it was just shadows. The newer pictures were shown to not really show facial features. Yes people could see the figure of a face, but its outrageous to think that an alien formed such thing.

These facts show that it is highly unlikely to have an alien form such thing. There is more proof that it is a natural landform.

If you look at the picture from 1976 it can resemble a face, but if you look at the 2001 picture it just looks like a landform. Here's another thing, the one from 1998 looks like volcanic activity is emerging, which could be the case. These pictures contain important information, and data that can be analyzed, which will help NASA find out more about this.

Let's go back to the Viking 1 spacecraft. This machine was built in 1976, which could possibly mean the machines camera was broken, or malfunctioning. One major factor in this is NASA. NASA is a company who study's life outside our atmosphere. When they launch probes into space it costs millions of dollars to do so. When they find real life outside our atmosphere they get paid for all the research they've done.

Then there's the rumors that certain people spread around. Usually it's untrue, but there's a possibility that it's true.

This landform is made completely by nature and it is a very neat attraction and we should admire it but remember that it wasn't made by aliens.    ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
103B05DC95C8,"I'm here to tell you that the face on mars is not the face to a martian, but there is always both sides to a situation like this. I'm a scientist and there are some explanation to why this face exsict on both sides. My side is that the face on mars could be seen wrong, it could be a pile of rocks, and there is many wierd things on this planet with weird shapes, it cant always be martians or aliens.

So to start this off it could be a alien but there is a strong possibility that its not either. First the face is way to larg to be an actual face, it say it the artical the it is measured in meters, thats almost impossible. It also says in the artical that the face on mars was just an illusion caused by the shadowing on the rocks to make it look like a face. If you look furter into the artical it says that everytime they went across the planet that it looked exactly the same.

It is a real debate on whether the face is real or not. There is also strong evidence on both sides, but NASA has alot of proof that it isn't an alien, they could be hiding it or they can be wrong.

6A262FE09D0B,"You may think that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. That is not true. The Face is just a natural ladform. There is a lot of evidence to support my argument. Like it is simply just a mesa, the photo Malin took, and there are many similar landforms around the American West. Certainly it wasn't created by aliens!

It is just a mesa. First, Martian mesas were common. They were very common around Cydonia as said in the article. Second, it did look like a face. That is because of the unusual shadows that formed to look kind of like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Third, it gives an illusion. The illusion is of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. These are the reasons that shows that the Face is a Martian mesa.

Michael Malin's photo shows that it is a landform. First, Malin's photo was taken ten times sharper. It lets it have a more clear image. Second, people think that the alien markings were hidden by haze. Though on the second picture it still doesn't show any sign of alien markings. Third, on April 8, 2001 another photo was taken. That day it was a cloudless summer day. Malin's tame captured a fantastic photo. It still didn't show that the Face was created by aliens. The photos that Malin and his team took were very useful.

It is similar to the world in a way. Using photos of the Face they would be able to see if there was any sign of life. Like small homes, or shacks. Second, it is defenitly equivalent to a butte or mesa. There is so much information to prove that. Third, it has landforms in common around the American West. Gavin stated 'It remids me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is similar in a way to America.

Now you know the reasons why the Face on Mars was not created by aliens. There is so mush evidence to prove it. Like my examples which are it is actually a mesa, Michael's photo shows no signs of aliens markings or their homes, and the Face is similar to some landforms in the American West. There is a lot more evidence to prove that the Face on Mars is not a creation by aliens, but a normal Martian landform.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
C9DF48901747,"So you say the discovery of the face Cydonia that was founded in Mars back in 1976 was created by aliens. I seem to disagree with your argument. As we have done more research here in NASA back in 2001 each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meter per pixel in the best 1976 image which means with the new and more improved technology we got a closer and better resolution of the face Cydonia on Mars which you so think was created by aliens. The recent image of Cydonia from 2001 has better pixel quality so that we can zoom in more to see if there are any other objects other than Cydonia such as cars or houses in which we both know don't exist in the red planet. Cydonia has unusual shadows that make it resemble a human head with it giving us an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. What the picture actually show is the Martian equivalent of a butte Mesa which are also landforms that are commonly found in the American West. So as you know that after the discovery, photographing Cydonia has became one of our main priority for us here at NASA to prove that it wasn't created by aliens. I hope that after you heard my side of the argument you have a different view of Cydonia as it formed by itself in the red planet.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
40066209AEE9,"While most people believe the ""Face"" on mars was just a natural landform there are also people who believe it was created by aliens. Those people believed it was an alien artifact that was seen in the photograph taken above Mars by Viking 1 during 1946. But there are many peices of evidence that support the idea of the ""Face"" just being a natural landform.

For starters, when the ""Face"" was first seen on Cydonia, Mars, it was photographed by Viking 1 on 1976, which during that time cameras weren't as powerful as cameras now so the picture quality back in 1976 was blurry compared to today's photos. The '' Face"" was actually just a Martian mesa which is a lava dome, which are common in Cydonia. Soon after, scientists concluded "" it was a huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" And if the ""Face was actually created by aliens NASA wouldn't have told the public since it could've caused public panic, but instead NASA used the ''Face"" as a way to attract the public's attention towards Mars. So in the end, the ""Face"" did bring much attention to Mars which was NASA's intention.

While conspiracy theorists believe the ""Face"" was real evidence of life on Mars, it was actually not, defenders of the NASA budget confirmed it when they said that they wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Even when few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA. So on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Then, the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a picture which was ten times sharper rhan the original Viking photos. And so, the Face was confimed by Micheal Malin and his Orbiter Cameria (MOC) team to just be a natural landform.

But still again people were not content since the Face on Mars was located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998, which was a cloudy day. And so, the camera in the MGS had to take a photograph though clouds to see the Face which skepics still said ""alien markings were hidden by the haze."" So once more, on April 8, 2001, which was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia the MGS or the Mars Global Sirveyor grew closer until it was 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. The 2001 photo spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

In conclusion, the photo taken on 2001, finally confirmed that the Face on Mars was really a Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa. So in the end, the Face was never created by aliens but it was just a natural landform.                        ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Is the ""Face On Mars"" real? Was the pictures mistaken to come out as something else? The photo from 1976 was a big deal because,of what they seen.

I think the photo is just a plain platform they has been formed into something it was not. Something that has changed a lot of people's minds.

I have heard a lot of stories about the ""Unmasking Face on Mars"" and they are quite interesting. I was with this scientists who said he saw the forming shape of an alien Martian and has believed it well. He said that , "" I saw a huge rock type of formation that was forming into a human head"". ""The rock might have looked like a forming figure,but it was just a natural land that appeared to look like a alien type figure. NASA has taking picuters of the figure that look like alien artifacts. They were just regular wierd shaped objects .

In 2001, the pictures that was taking on the planet showed nothing. Later on in reseach,we discovered that the research on the Martian figures sought out to be fake. I described everything we found on the photos that was taking. ""I have seen those photos and they are not true. The basic studies say they were a consparicy and were hidden because they were not sought to be real shot photos of the forming figures. "" If you look closely at the phots took in 2001 one you shall she the photo shows nothing but land and a ight platform of the planet"" I said to show a better undersatding of ehat the photo shows.

"" I have done research on this for years and only seen photos of the moving figures of a Martian moving on Cydonia."" "" We have seen photos or illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth in the resonable photos I have seen."" "" This photo shows how the ancient civilization of these forming aliens are real."" These forms are basic facts and sought to be true.

Those photos show and just make the picutre seem like it is forming real life aliens, but that is just how the photo was shot. Continuosly, NASA has changed the way they shot the photos. The photo that was taking before was not taking carefully. The others that was taking was by a more advanced shot. Then it was stated to be no alien monument at all. It was just a natural platform of the planet.

This was just a basic statement to show how the alien photos shot by Viking was just not like it was in 2001. Were the phots true? Did the Face On Mars really affect the live of what lives outside of us? Well we know that it really was a natural platform.         ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

AB648E5DBB81,"Hello, I am a scientist from NASA I am here to tell you that the Face, found on Mars, was not created by aliens, the face is just a natural landform. We have new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from the NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is. The Face is just a mesa created by natural landforms. I am sorry to tell you but aliens do not exist, we haven't found any evidence proving that aliens exist.

Twenty five years ago NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet Mars taking some pictures of the possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking. While it was taking the pictures for the possible landing sites, something funny had happened, it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face on the plant. It turned out to be an enormous head nearly two miles form end to end. No this was not created by aliens. Us scientist have been working as hard as we can to see how this ""Face"" was created. We haven't found anything about it being created by aliens. The Face is just a natural landform. Us scientist at NASA figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, this mesa had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

A few days later us at NASA released the image to the public to see. The title of the image was ""huge rock formation ... which resembles a human head ... formed by shadows giving an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" A few of us scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact, but it was talked about with the scientist of NASA and we decided that it wasn't created by aliens because there is no sign of life on Mars that we have found. On April 5, 1998, is when a Mars Global Surveyor flew over the Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera, also known as (MOC), team snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original Viking photos. The pictures revealed that it was a natural landform. There was no proof that it was created by aliens. Aliens do not exist they are just made up and scientists, like me, at NASA have never found evidence about aliens existing.

Not everyone was satified with the picture. Everyone thought that the weather conditions were different because the Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98. Since it was winter in April '98, it was a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera on board, MGS, had to peer through the wispy clouds to see the Face, so people thought that the photo that was taken was not a fair photo. The people wanted a fair photo that they could see in almost the same weather condtions. We gave people what they want and we went to look for it again. Mission controllers prepared to look again but it was not easy. The face is very hard to track and get a picture of. The Mars Global Surveyor on Apil 8, 2001, went to take another picture, and it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. The spacecraft had to be 25 degrees to center the Face. Each pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo had 43 meters per pixel, but when it was compared to he 2001 image it spans 1.56 meters. The picture was easier to look at and they got a closer view. They came to the conclusion of it just being a natural landform.

In conclusion, the image from NASA, known as the Face, was not created by aliens. The image is just a natural landform. According to scientist, like me, at NASA there was no proof that the Face was not created by aliens. Thanks to the technology that we have it is very clear that the image is just a natural landform that created itself. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
5394485B02AB,"Some claim that a picture of a natural landmark and a shadow is really a sign of alien lifeform or a civilization. Nasa a billion dollar company dissagrees and has proof that this is indeed a landmark with a shadow and not any sort of alien life. That has not stopped some conspiracy theorists from saying that this is a cover up.

Nasa as we all know is a company that is paid to fly unmanned and sometimes manned aircraft into the sky and most excitingly space. That is a positive thing for us humans who have no idea why we are here and how are we here. People don't like to know or believe the truth and sometimes make up lies or takes something the wrong way and make everyone from the news to the everyday household hear about something that didn't even turn out to be true. That is the same case here, Nasa released a photo of a mountain during a time of day that would have shadows, and Nasa being a public and government company is forced by law to release photos to the people. Which leads to more proof if Nasa took more photos that showed aliens or other inteligent lifeforms they would have to release it they can't just magicly hit erase.

Conspiracy theorist still do not believe Nasa so they demand more photos and still Nasa has even more proof that this ""face'' is indeed a montain with shadows stratigicly placed to look like a human face. Theorist say that everything Nasa does is either faked or fixed to look like something it is not. In this case it went viral and many people still believe it was aliens that went there and did that but Nasa declines and this time Nasa has a little more proof.

Nasa would've got money to send a human or a robot to Cydonia if it were a human lifeform or an alien, and we all know the team that worked on it would've got some pretty heavy paychecks just by working on the case, just imagine that checks the team would make if it were a civilivation. But Nasa will not be sending over humans or a robot for a couple reasons, the best reason is that the already know that this is just a mountain, not a civiliation.

In conclusion Nasa knows this is a mountain and not a lifeform of any kind.

Nasa also knows that lifeforms like ours can not survive on the surface of any planet without an atmousphere like mars. So even if a lifeform can survive without oxygen unlike us that the proof of that area says otherwise.   ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
05E41ED44992,"The Face is a natural landform on Cydonia. Speculators doubt NASA, and say that the landform was created by aliens. Both of these claims have evidence to support their side. One side I believe has more evidence to prove their claim.

The side that disagrees with the thought that the Face was made naturally, are called speculators. NASA has realeased information about the Face, but speculators think NASA is hiding something from them which is called bona fide. Since the very first trip to Cydonia, many people have been intreaged by the topic. As said in paragrapgh 5 , ""The Face has become a pop icon"". The idea that a face was on Cydonia made people think that there had to be a creator. The creators were aliens. The next time the Mars Orbiter Camera went to Cydonia, NASA claimed there were clouds blocking the veiw of the Face. This must have shown that NASA was hiding something. NASA also tried to say that they don't pass over the Face that often. Maybe NASA didn't people to find things out. All these peices of evidence put together must prove that aliens created the Face on Cydonia.

Scientist from NASA can help prove the speculators wrong. Speculators assume that the Face couldn't have just been created over time. In paragrapgh 12, it states that there are similar landforms created, called mesa, in America. Next, the speculators say that there were clouds blocking the veiw of alien clues during the Orbit Camera journey. Since the clouds blocked the veiw of the planet, NASA sent another camera on clear day. In paragrapgh 10 and 11 it says the camera took the absolute maximum resolution. If there were any signs of anything strange the camera would have caught it. Speculators say that NASA wants to hide the fact that there were aliens. If there were aliens then that would help NASA's budget in future journeys. The evidence provided proves thay the Face was naturally created.

After recieving both sides of the story. I support the NASA and the fact that the Face was naturally created. The speculators had their concerns about the legibillity of NASA. Speculators believed that NASA was hiding things. NASA respnoded to the critics and proved that there were no aliens. Plus, if there were aliens out there then that would help

NASA with many things. Those are the reasons why I thing the Face was naturally created.

My first reason is because aliens do not exist. There has been much research in this world to prove that aliens do not exist, but still some people believe that there are aliens. Whenever something weird happens in space, we always have to say aliens exist, and there is a lot of proof that they don't. On Mars, landforms can change, just like any other planet. For example, in 1976 it started out by looking like a bump. Then in 2001, it warped into many different shapes with cracks or ridges in it, and in the end it turned out looking like a face.

My second reason is because NASA has proved that it is a natural landform. It says in paragraph 7, On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When they recieved the photo it revealed a natural landform. The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. So, the Face was proved to be a natural landform in the end.

My third reason is because the Face looks like landforms on Earth. In paragraph 12 it states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the Americian West."" This tells us that the Face is common and not a shockingly new landform. Also, in paragraph 12 it says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" So, the Face is obviously not a new thing, because Earth has a landform very similar to it. Landforms are made naturally and it takes many years to start noticing the changes in a landform.

Some people might say that aliens are real and that over the years they have been working on this landform. They could also say that NASA rarely goes over the Face because it is so hard to find, so NASA never sees the aliens because of this reason. This is all true, except that aliens are real; there is no true proof of knowing if aliens are real or not, but they most likely aren't. Also, NASA has proved that the Face isn't a new landform, but that it is similar to many landforms on Earth.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform. I believe that the Face on Mars is a natural landform because aliens do not exist, NASA has proved that it is a natural landform, and it looks like landforms on Earth.      ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

They explained that it was just a ""huge rock formation"" . . . which resembles an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth formed by shadows.

There is also more reasons as why this is clearly just a natural landorm.

NASA had to make sure they were correct on there research, therefor the orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper then the original Viking's photo. Which then clearly proved that there so no alien movement after all and once again that it was just a natural landform.

The proof of that is that they have taken pictures in 1998,2001, and have compared it to a landform in the USA. People who believe it is created by aliens suely hasn't seen all the evidence behind ""The Face.""

First of all, when people saw the face in 1976 they couldnt have had o believe an aliens as making it. How could have there have been a person on Cydonia or an alien. That is why they went back to Mars to prove some scientists' theories wrong. On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor had flew over Cydonia for the first time. The surveyor had a picture that was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Some people were not satisfied because it was cloudy on the Red Planet. They said that the alien marking were hidden by blaze. Compaing the picture of 1998, it certailey looks more like a regular rock on a surface. They went back four years later on a less cloudy day to still prove the believers wrong.

On a cloudless day the Mars Global Surveyor took away a piece of evidence of aliens in space. On April 8, 2001, four years later than the last visit to Cydonia, the surveyor captured the photo much better than all pictures and proved tha the face was a natural platform.

A few scientists believed that the face was an alien artifact, but phototgraphing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when MGS arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, they photographed the face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. MGS is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine. Eighteen years later they decided to end the mission, they felt that it was important to taxpayers.

On April 5, 1998, MGS flew across Cydonia for the first time. A team of Mars Orbiters took a picture ten time sharper than the original photo. An enormouse amount of web surfers waited for the pricture, but when it posted they weren't so satisfied. There wasn't and alien monument after all. NASA just does not pass over the face very often.

On April 8, 2001, MGS drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in field of view. The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa, which again are landforms common around the american West. It reminds people of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Each of the pictures pixles in 2001 had a span of 1.56 meters compareed to 43 meters per pixle in the best 1972 image. If there were to be objects in the pictuer such as a plain on the ground or Eqyptian style Pyramids you would see them. So after all there is no face on the panet, it is just a landform called a butte.    ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Although few scientist believed the face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA when mars global surveyor [MGS] arrived at the red planet in sSeptember 1997 eighteen long years after the viking missions ended. So it was true that aliens did not do that to mars because aliens are not real and also NASA even said that they did it on mars they said it was an accident that happened in September 1997.

4D4CE382C062,"Many people think that the ""Face"" is actually the work of an ancient civilization that used to, or still might, live on Mars. Those people are proven wrong in many ways. I believe that the Face is not a Martian creation because if NASA knew about it, they would tell people so that they would get more publicity and make more money.

Also, after a higher resolution picture was taken of the face, it was clear that there was no sign of equipment near the face to build it. Lastly, Jim Garvin, who is a Mars expert, said, after long research, that the Face is just a landform.

The first reason people should be able to tell that the Face is not a Martian creation is that NASA would tell people about the chance of Alien life on Mars. That fantasy has been around for hundreds of years! Books and movies have stories of Aliens from Mars. There would be many more sales for NASA. Therefore, it is obvious that NASA would tell the public if there really was a chance of Martian excistence.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a photograph of the Head that was tens times sharperthan the first picture taken by the Viking. Many anxious web surfers where waiting for the image to appear on the JPL web site. The picture revealed a natural landform. There was no sign of aliens at all. Concluding the reason as to why the Face is just a coax.

The third and final reason as to why the Face is fraud is that scientist Jim Garvin said that the Face is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Which means landforms common around the American West. He said, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" That is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa that is about the same height as the Face which appears on The Red Planet.

Now many people may argue that the picture was taken when it a cloudy time of the year in Mars - the picture may not have been able to see everything around the face. But, according to Garvin, you can discern things in a digital picture three times bigger than the pixel size so if there even were objets in the picture that showed any sign of excistence, you would be able to see them. Therefore there is no possoble way of a human or Martian building the Face.

So, the many people in the world that believe that the Face on Mars is actually a creation of living beings, they are proven wrong. Multiple reasons point to the Face just being a landform that just so happens to be in the shape of a face. Not only would it take forever to make a face that is two miles long, it would also take supplies - which were not found. Furthermore, the Face on Mars is not a Martian creation.

7DC967D6B8B7,"Some people believe in the supernatural and in the paranormal. Others on the otherhand dont. Then there are people that believe in aliens and in various life forms on diffrent planets. If we ask the question ""Is there such thing as aliens and if so how do we know?"" In hollywood there has been many movies made about aleins and about other life forms in the galaxy (ET, the Men In Black series, and Indipendence Day). The reality is that we don't know if there are really aleins, we just have faith in the unknown.

The people that believe aliens exist had a feild day over the recent discovery by NASA in 1976-2001 by the Viking 1. The viking 1 found an astonishing rock form that took the shape of a humans face. the first thing most people said was, ""There is alein life on mars!"" These people could be right, we have been serching for dozens of years for other life foarms, and its the perfect time to find a breakthrough in science and in astronomy.

To others the belief of the face, found on mars, made by an alein is a hoax. It is just a story for the public to stay entertained. The face on the surface of mars is just a rock and it is made by natural movement under and on the surface of mars and not by a life form such as an alien. In the article"" Unmasking the Face on Mars"" the author says, "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The face in mars brings apn no new information to astronomy because there has not yet been any proof of any life on mars.

The faith we have in this ""mission"" is more faith than we have had regarding new creatures in the deapths of the sea. When we think of ailens we see big eyed weird headed creatures, but how do we know? The answer is that we dont. We have no assurence that there are aleins and they look and talk how we believe they do. There are manyh possibilitys on how landforms made the face such as the hardening of lava, tectonic plates, astroids or other rocks that entered Marses atmosphere,or it could have been made by the rotaion of mars .

Over all the idea of aleins makes a good hollywood movie, but it doesn't make a good reality. As Mr. Garvin says, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on Mars."" Until the day we physicaly see another life form, we won't have any further helpful scientific discovery regarding aleins.       ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
2CFF0E0BCA0C,"The Face on Mars is not an alien monument or creation. A lot of people do think that it was made by some alien life form but they are mistaken. Scientists have done multiple studies to conclude that it is a natural landformation.

First of all, the formation is known as a mesa. There are shadows from the formation that give the illusion of eyes, a mouth, and a nose. Also in the picture from 2001 each pixel in the photo graph is 1.56 meters on the planet so you would be able to see any artifacts or structures if there were any.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not an alien formation. Scientists have proven this by the effect of the shadows on the rock, the fact that it is a mesa, and by there not being any artifacts on or around the formation. Therefore, this is not evidence of there being ancient civilizations on Mars. ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
ABB7625615F2,"The ""Face On Mars"" is getting talked about a lot lately. Many people have different opinions about the face. If you aren't familiar with the ""face on mars"" then you're probably wondering why there is an argument going around. You're probably wondering this exact question: ""Why is there a big argument about ""The Face On Mars?"" The folllowing details and information will be informing you exactly why scientists and theorists are having different opinions about the peculiar face.

Some scientists are saying that the face up on the moon was not created by aliens because of all the research they have done with and about it. One example that tells you why it isnt an alien artifact is the shadows. The only way the messa (face on the moon) was able to have facial features was because of the shadows that was cascading down upon it. The shadows gave an illusion of eyes, a nose, and also a mouth.

Another example, would be the pictures that the scientists have taken. The first picture that was taken was taken on a cloudy day. The picture was to blurry to be able to make out any details. In 1998, Michael Malin and his MOC team took another picture that was ten times sharper than the first. One of the cameras they had contributed greatly to the search, since that camera was so sharp they would have easily been able to find any markings from extraterrestrial beings.

Also another detail helping the scientists was the weather. The weather took a massive part in this study. Since it wasn't a clear day at all and there were ""wispy clouds"", like in paragragh eight, the MOC team could not get a clear picture. When the team comes back to take yet another picture it is a clear day and with that clear day they are able to pick out any details from the ""artifact"" if there are any to pick out.

A final example, is how they compared the face to a formation on Earth. The scientists compared the face to the Snake River Plain of Idaho because of how similar they are. They are similar in a way because of the isolated messa, height, and landforms.

Theorists are saying the exact oppsoite from the researchers. Here is an example fo why they thought it was a true artifact. A few scientists themselves thought that is wasn't just a landform but something more. Since the scientists believed many people instantly believed too. They didn't think about the research that was done, but they chose to believe the few scientists.

An example that would support the idea of them believing, is that there were many movies made about the face. Many people believe everything they hear and what they see on T.V.

A final example is, how the skeptics thought it was created. ""If the aliens didn't create it then how did it form?"" That question was most likely going through their mind, trying to figure out if they should believe science and research or they should believe movies and others.

Yes, i understand how skeptics actually believe that the face was made by aliens because they dont know how it was created. They don't know who created it either. Scientists are proving that it was weather that created the formation and maybe even astroides. Theorists may also thinking that the haze prevented the scientists from seeing the alien's markings. If weather and haze prevented that then why didn't the scienists see the markings on the next photo that they took. That photo was even ten times shaprer.

The examples I have lsited help inform you why there is an argument going on about the face. Science clears and explains a lot more phenonmon than opinions and belifes do.    ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

People said that the photo was cloudy so then they went out again in 2001 and the pixels are much better. They went out again and it was not cloudy either. It was clear that the photo was a landform.

Imagine if you saw a face on another planet what would you think? NASA saw one and thought it was a mesa others thought otherwise. I think it is a mesa on the red planet.

In 1976 Viking 1 took a photo of formations on mars. The picture looked like a face so the people of the world thought oh my god. Aliens invaded mars and they will invade us run! But NASA kept saying other wise.

But two decades later (give or take two years) another picture was taken and to more and more people thought it was a face. No matter NASA tried to say it was rock formations but no one lisitened. No one lisitened to NASA because the conspirasicy theorisits of the world were feeding the fire way too much.

Then three years later

NASA relased another picture of the ""face"" but captioned ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth"". Now no one thought anything of the ""face"" everyone but the consipary theorists said it was a cover story but science won the day.

4C1BBB746854,"This is

Dianee and she is going to eplain to you why the ""face"" was not created by aliens. It all started in 1976 when Viking 1 took a photo of the ""face"". The face was located in Cydonia it is two miles long from end to end. It looked like a face of an Egyptian Pharaoh. It is actually a mesa. Then,in 1998 the MOC wanted to take another picture because many people were saying that it was created by aliens. This picture would be in movies,books,magazines,radio talk shows and even in grocery stores for twenty five years.

When NASA let the public see this picture they believed it was created by aliens. We went back in 1998 and took some more pictures and it had still looked like a face but it was not. My people said that we (NASA) would rather hide then say that there was life on Mars, many conspiracy theorists were saying. We wouldn't hide we would tell the public so that we could get more money to be able to go to Mars and see these aliens.

What some people wanted was aliens and other people didn't. Mostly all the scientists at NASA including myself did not believe that the""face"" was created by aliens. So in 2001 we went again to Mars to get a picture of the ""face"". It would be a clearer picture because the cameras were ten times better than the cameras in 1976 and in 1998. It was very hard to get to that exact spot on Mars. The face on Mars was 41 degrees north martian latitude. On April 8,2001 it was summer in Cydonia when we had taken the picture in 1998 it was winter and it was very cloudy. The camera was 1.56 meters per pixel in 1976 it was 43 meters per pixel.

So if there was objects on Mars like a plane of a pyramid we would know because we would be able to see it. We said that it was either a butte or a mesa. They are commom in the American West. It's kinda like the Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho. They are basically lava domes but the one on Mars had looked like a face becasuse of the shadows.

FEF334C14BAE,"Sounds thrilling, doesn't it? It's almost like a science-fiction novel. This mesa found on Mars has theories going in two directions. Was it created by aliens, or is it a natural landform? Both are possible, but only one is probable. The media can lead you to believe information that might not be true. Like in this situation, the ""Face on Mars"" that is said to be bona fide evidence of alien life, but it is proven to be just a natural landform.

Forty years ago, when the ""face"" was first revealed, it seemed very likely that it was not made by nature. The search for alien life and all the money put into NASA's programs made people believe what they wanted to hear. As time went on, and new technology was put into effect, the images of the mesa became clearer. In the early 2000's, it was made clear that the mysterious ""face"" was just an illusion. One can tell from the images of the ""Face on Mars"" that the mesa can appear to look like a face when out of focus. Alien life on Mars has not been proven either, so without evidence of life, we can't assume that the ""face"" was not created by nature.

It is possible that the mesa appeared as a face because of the dept perception and shadows. In reality, the landform barely looks like a face at all. In the most recent photo, the small details on the mesa almost look like the rivers we have here on Earth. The mesa is even compared to landforms that are found on Earth, as stated in the article.

In the passege ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", it states, ""The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"" The reson why the rock formation looks like a face could be from rocks being inside the sand to formate the face and the rocks could have shrunken or have gone away.

18113556C5DC,"First off , In my opinion I think that there is no face on the moon. Some of NASA believe that some aliens made the face on the moon years ago. I believe that there is no face and that is beacuse there are no aliens. If there is a face on the moon it was probably made by an astroid or a meteorid that crashed there a few years ago and it was just now starting to form more into a face. If it were aliens who created the face on the moon, why didn't they come back time after time so the humans could see them. Honestly, who is there to blame for this mysterious face on the moon? Many people may ask, what should we do to figure out if there is a face or not. Well in my opinion, I think we should have NASA send someone or some people to the moon and see whats really going on. NASA also doesn't have evidence that there are aliens that did it. They just assume that there are aliens basically. Maybe there is really no face on the moon. I really think that maybe NASA should either just let this go or they should just send someone to space to chck it out. I just don't like how NASA has no evidence that there are asliens who made the face. I think maybe NASA should just go check it out for themselves.

Second, 25 years ago when Viking 1 snapped a photo of the face on the moon, it didn't really look all that good. Even when they took the photo from 1998 and 2001 the pictures still didn't look as nice as they should.

The NASA crew had stumbled upon the image when they were orbiting their sister ship Viking 2 Spacecraft. They may have gotten a clear image of the ""Face"" but they hadn't known the conditions of the planet before they made the assumption of Martian activity. They plastered it all over the US not knowing if the ""Face"" was really evidence of alien life on planets; excluding Earth.

Garvin recognized the landform. He said it had looked like a butte or a mesa he had seen on earth. Who knows if the the landforms on earth can form on a different planet. Garvin said, and I quote, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Scienctists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia. There have been ""buttes"" or ""mesas"" in the region of Cydonia before. I do not understand why this ""Face on Mars"" is any different if it was common in the region where it was found. The formation looked like a face. Okay well, sometimes you see random formations on the street with trash. You wouldn't give it a second glance. So, I don't know why this formation on Mars would be any different.

I believe that the formation is just different shadows coming together to make one big shadow. The brain can do crazy things, even trick you at times. I think the formation is just a mind trick that everyone fell for.               ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The statement that the Face was created by aliens is nonsense. There are no facts to back the idea up. Aliens haven't even been proved to be real! People need to understand that the Face is just a mesa, a type of landform that be found on Earth aswell.

If the aliens were real, don't you think something would have changed by now? There is absolutley no sign of any life near the mesa; not even on the planet. If the aliens did exist then we should have noticed some sign. The statement that the Face is only a landform is clearly correct, unlike the idea that creatures formed it into Mars.

The statement that the Face is just a mesa has lots of proof to back it up. There are many sets of pictures, including the pictures from the original Viking itself. The Viking was the spaceship on Mars that helped capture the landform on camera. There are also pictures from recent explorations that further prove that the Face is just a landform.

I think one of the reasons people like to dream up conspiracys is because of the other ideas spread by celebritys. People like talk show hosts spread there ideas for large groups of people to hear, causing people to further think on those ideas.

DECAC443C667,"On May 24, 2001, Mars was the topic of conversation with those at NASA and other space stations who were included on the Viking 1 and Viking 2 space mission. On that day, the Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars. On the other hand, its sister ship, Viking 2, spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. According to Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, the face on Mars resembles Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. But one argument leaves many citizens guessing: Is the face on Mars a true natural landform?

Most at the NASA space station argue that the face is in fact a true natural landform. The face would be considered a natural landform because there isn't actual proof that aliens had created the landform. This statement meaning that there isn't, for example, video footage proof of the landform being created by aliens, which could have been something that could prove that the face is either natural or unnatural. Another reason why this face could be a natural landform is that no one has actually lived on Mars, so no one could stand up and say whether or not it's natural. For the face to be natural, Mars itself would've had to go through natural causes such as erosion or a quake for the face to be created.

On the other hand, it's easy to see why people would think that the face was created by aliens. In the history of the world, many peculiar events have happened where nobody knew how they happened. For example, all over the Earth, there have been cases of weird patterns appearing in corn fields and mazes. People would say that the patterns were created by aliens, so many just say that weird occurences are due to weird, foreign beings: Aliens. Furthermore, another reason why people would think that the face was created by aliens that ties into the other side of the argument is that since no human being has lived on Mars, there is no factual evidence that states that the face was created by natural causes or by aliens; but since aliens live on Mars and other planets in space, people are forced to make the conclusion that aliens made them.

In conclusion, some people don't even have an opinion and they just believe the scientific evidence over the belief that aliens had created them. People might believe this evidence because some people, in fact, don't even believe in aliens at all. But the face could very well be a natural landform due to natural causes such as erosion of the planet or quakes in Mars that formed the face. Or if there are aliens on Mars, the face-according to some people- could've also been created by aliens that lived on Mars. But according to the scientists and chiefs at NASA, the Mars Exploration Program, and other space stations involved in the Viking 1 and Viking 2 space mission, the face on Mars was only created by natural occurrences and they try to get people to believe it by plastering it all over Hollywood movies, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines.

Most importantly not letting people make a big deal out of this because they don't know what it could be yet .

Sometime we can't say somethings at the most part , Because it's better not to let anyone know before people go crazy and go around asking a bunch of questions . The Face on Mars was discovered in 1976 , and by the time that has passed , it's easier to see how it actually looks . But of cource you can't just send someone out to space and actually see what's going on . It's not that easy to just do that . There could be some species that are out there somewhere and don't even know about it . A period of time we believed it might have been a alien artifact , but it doesn't look like an alien's face which is something we could be for sure about that . Seeing the picture that the ( MOC ) team revealing the photo of the face , people weren't so satisfied as they thought . The people must be thinking , "" There's something up in space , should we be clam or should it be best to be worried ? "" , that's what might have happens when people don't listen to what we say is best and do what they think is right .

But at the end of all this story and "" Oh it''s this "" or "" No , wait it's actually that

"" , it turns out that it is actually a Martian equivalent of a butte or of the mesa . It's a common landforms around American West and it's the lava dome that formed an isolated mesa . Which is the same height as the "" Face on mars "" . Everything is perfectly fine , and everyone can be clam since we found out the actual and correct information and not just some random anwers that people were going around and saying about this .

NASA is only saying its an alien artifact because it'll benefit NASA in the long run.

The Face on Mars looks just like a natural face. Also, its just a natural landform. In paragraph 3, it restates, ""huge rock formaton . . . which resembles a human head . . .."" The illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth, which was created by shadows. So, the Face on Mars has human characteristics.

NASA is only saying its life, and also saying the face was created by Aliens because itll benefit them in the long run. In paragraph 3 it even says, "" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Then in paragraph 4 it restates, ""It certainly did!"" Meaning, the engagemnet to the public and on Mars worked. Now, that NASA discovered the Face on Mars, it has become a pop icon, starred in Hollywood films, and ETC.

There is no evidence that Aliens have been on the Planet Mars. It says the Face on Mars resembles a rock formation. Then. the shadows gave it eyes, nose, and a mouth. It says nothing about

Aliens creating the Face . Although few scientist believe the Face was an alien artifact, many still believed it was a real Human Face.

When, the MOC team snapped a picture . . . thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a website called JPL. The JPL website revealed a natural landform. Finally, there was no alien monument after all.

In conclusion, The Face on Mars is a just a natural landform. First, The Face on Mars looks just like a natural face, there is no evidence that aliens have been on the Planet Mars, and NASA is only saying the face was created by aliens beacuse it'll benefit them in the long run.

For example, 22 years later Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) was able to take a picture of the figure ten times sharper. After this picture was taken, more people were able to believe that this mask on Mars was just natural landform. Then 3 years later in 2001 we had taken another picture that was even closer and it diffinetly showed landform.

Yes, the ""Face on Mars"" was discorvered to be a mesa, or landforms common around the American West. With all these pictures from 1976 to 2001, we had compared them to these Earth landforms.

As NASA did research on the figure they ran tests, and did many other things to collect data form the subject. They unveiled the image for people all around the world to see. And that wasnt exactly a good idea. It caused many complications and conflict. But that didnt stop us from doing more research with the figure.

Did you beieve that the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" was just created by aliens. NASA has given us many reasons to believe what they say, and not many reasons for us not believe them. I am a NASA researcher and I'm telling you why the ""Face"" is actually just a landmark.

There are many reasons why the ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" is a natural land form. The first reason is that NASA took three different pictures, one picture was in 1976 in the picture you can't really see anything. Scientists just thought it was another Matian mesa. At this time the cameras weren't very 3D like. So how do we know it's an actual face?

The seacond reason it is a landform is because NASA

sent another crew to take more pictures of the ""face."" The crew took ten pictures that were sharper than the first one in 1976. In this picture you start to see something appear. They even say ""when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. People were not very happy when they heard it wasn't a alien monument.

Another reason is that they thought alien markings were being hazed. So, when they went back it was a cloudless summer. In the text they say ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. That is a huge difference from 1976. What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa.

If you really think about it though, how come they jumped to conclusions so fast? In the passage it says it would be a good way to engage the public to Mars. Wouldn't it just attract more people to NASA to though?

In many ways there are more reasons to why this ""Face"" is more of a landmark than anything. From the different years they took the years, to the landmarks being hazed. You could probably think of a lot of questions to ask NASA about the photos and what the scientists are saying, but until you go up to Mars we will only know what they are telling us.

851B84DCDFCA,"In 1976 something very strange was found by the Viking 1 spacecraft. It appeared to be a face on the surface of the planet Mars. With this discovery NASA scientists took further investigations into what this picture could actually be. The scientists looked at the picture and determined that it was not a face only a mesa that looked like a face because shadows were casted onto it.

NASA realeased this picture to the public saying that this was not a face on Mars only a mesa. This attracted the publics attention and it became a huge pop icon that appeared in books,magazinse,radio talk shows,and even in grocery store isles for Twenty-Five years.

Many conspiracy theorists thought that this could actually be evidence of life on Mars,But if this was true why would NASA not realease it to get a huge government grant to try and develope a way to send people to Mars to explore.

On April 5,1998 Eightteen years after the Viking 1 and 2 were shut down the Mars Orbiter Camera came into orbit range of Mars and started taking pictures. The team of scientists espiecially focused on getting a picture of the face so they could reveal to public that there was indeed no face on Mars. The picture came back alot more clear and showed that there was no face on Mars therefore stating that there was no ancient civilization that NASA was hiding.

On April 8,2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take another picture of the face,And this time the scientists angled it perfectly so they had the best possible picture to stop all the non-sense about the face on Mars. They took the picture and enhanced it three times the size. This picture was released to public and it showed that the ""Face"" was actually a martian equivalent of a mesa.

In conclusion there was no actually face on Mars,And the entire time it was only a landform which there are very many of on the entire planet of Mars.      ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
63BE35189978,"Life on Mars has been discussed for many years. The face on Mars has raised the concern on whether there is life on Mars.\ Most scientists believe that there is not enough evidence to show that there is infact life on Mars. Common people ,who disagree with scientists and other people who agree with the scientists, think there is enough evidence for life to be on mars. Life on Mars has been a very contradictory argument for many years. There has never been 100% true evidence of life on Mars. Many people just want to believe there is life.

First of all, the face on Mars has never shown any pure evidence that there is alien civilization on Mars. No on has ever been on Mars' surface to check around the face to see if there actually is pure evidence to support alien existence. If life does exist on Mars, we probably would have more evidence than we do now.

Next, for many years NASA and many other scientists, or even the common man, have been debating whether there really is life on Mars, or used to be. All of the pictures that scientists have now show no sign of life. If there was life, we probably would have noticed more structures around the face by now.

Finally, The main reason there is a debate between common men on whether there really is life on Mars is that they simply just want to make themselves believe there is life on Mars. The convince themselves there is life. They still have no scientific facts to support their claim.

In conlusion, the face on Mars is just a natural landform. If there is alien life on Mars, then there is no 100% pure evidence that there is or ever was. These are the reasons why life on Mars does not exist as we know of at the moment. But there could always be new evidence that says otherwise.       ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
B9BDDC576454,"My argument is about how the landform is just a natural occurance. I may have proof to why it may just be another hoax N.A.S.A. may be involved in. If you look closely at the pictures took within the time period of 1976-2001 you can tell there has been a mistake because you look at the (Face on mars) and you think what!? is that true?. I do not think it is real because if you look at the pictures from 1976-2001 you can tell there has been a increase in technology such as photography. If you were to look at the pictures then you can easily tell its not a face because for one there is no face there anymore another reason is it looks like a mesa as one reporter said.

My personal opinion is that it was just something to get the community aroused and it did indeed. In the passage it said ""It even haunted grocery lines for 25 years!"" and also it played its part in movies and things like that. And only recently in 2010-2016 has there been ANY proof there has been any life or there may be any life there what so ever. The reason of that is they found a river or something I can't exactly remember. And also they (N.A.S.A.) don't believe that there could be any life there because the atmosphere is so hin and so hot they believe that it would be hard for something to grow and live on the planet mars. That is why I believe it was either a hoax or a mis-understanding. Thank you very much.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
BD6CCC592409,"There is a small chance that the picture we saw that appears to be a face was left by ailens. We took multiple photos time and time again and none of them came back the same as the original. Also when we zoomed in there was no evidence supporting that alien built or form the figure that we saw. There was no tracks, no ships, and there was no sign of life.

There was no evidence left on that planet to show ailens where ever there or left the figure we saw. We have natrual land forms and that reminds us of mulitple things. So there is a possibilty that what we saw use to be a old volcaneo or somthing else.

Details that we took from the multiple photos we took don't match or even look like the first photo. All the othere photos we took was better quality than the first and none of them look like the original. So there is a chance that the camera caught somthing that with the unusual shadows was a once in a life time photo.

3A551777EB81,"Do you believe aliens are on mars? I am a scientist from NASA and I am here to tell you that there are no alien life forms on mars. Recently we have discovered a landform on mars that has the appearance of a human face. Many believe the face is ancient alien artifacts, and some believe it is a landform known as a Mesa or a Butte. This article will explain why this ""Face"" is not an alien artifact.

About 25 years ago a spacecraft oribting mars called the viking 1 was searching for landing spots for its sister ship called the viking 2. In 1976 Viking 1 took a picture of something that had the appearnace of a face, NASA could not explain it at first. After some research that mission controllers came to the conclusion that is was another martian mesa, they were common in the region of Cydonia on planet mars. A few days later NASA decided to unveil the image for all to see. The face on mars became a huge hit in pop culture it was featured in movies, books, magazines, and even on radio talk shows. Many people begain to think the face was evidence of aliens on mars and were confused because NASA would want to hid ethe evidence of aliens on mars. ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars."" Although few scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, Photographing Cydonia became a tp priority. NASA took pictures of the face every chance they had. In 1988 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and took good pictures of the face. When the photo was seen it was proof of no alien life it was just a landform on mars. Many were not satisfied and wanted more proof so in 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough to take more detailed pictures. When the scientist got the picture it shows a martian butte or mesa and the scientist compared it with the Middle Butte in the snake river plain of idaho in the american west. When it comes down to it there is no alien life on the planet of mars and the face is nothing but a landform with the appearance of a face. I hope this article has helped you decide if you think it is alien or a landform. ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

NASA sent one our space man Michael Malin to take some pictures with a better camera, revealing that their is no sign of alien life on Mars. ""But not everyone was not satified."" In April, 1998 we sent another spacecaft to take pictures of Mars but it was to cloudy witch made it look like an alien markings.

AF077034AC88,"The face on Mars wasn't created by aliens, in fact it has no connection to alien life form at all! When the face was first discovered no one had really known much about it so people started hopping to conclusions before anything could be proven or tested. That is until NASA started looking into this ""face on Mars"". The face is actually a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. That's it- simply a rock formation but the shadows casted upon the crevices gives the strange formation the appeal of a human face. When people began to become even more skepical, on April 8, 2001, NASA had the Mars Global Surveyor draw close enough to snap another picture of the face. The day was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. NASA's serveyor camera had taken a crisp photo of the face in highest resolution. ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel."" so you can discern things in a digital images three times better than the pixel size. So NASA, and the rest of the world, had a more clear and better picture of the face everyone was talking about. Although the face may seem strange, it could be a rather common landform for Cydonia. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" Although this one may seem to stick out from the rest, it could merely be the shadows playing tricks on the human mind. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" The landform may very well be common around Mars, it's merely the shadows ghosting around the landform that causes it to look like a face!

0A4295AE1179,"40 years ago, on mars, NASA caught a picture of a huge rock formation that looked like a face! Many thought it was evidence of life on mars while scientist thought it was just another a natural landform. After all it was just a natural landform that was shaped like a face and shadows that made the eyes, nose, and mouth.

First, Scientist just figured that it was just another Martian mesa, common around cydonia, but the only thing that was unusual was that the shadows made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. But, beside the shadows they still believe it is a natural land form. So they reveiled they photo for the world to see how cool it is.

But, It was taken the wrong way. Even though the said it was natural landforms, others believed it was life on mars. It became popular quickly. It was in books, magazines and even Hollywood films. Since everyone thought it was life on Mars scientist had to prove them selfs and take it one step closer.

Next, scientist had to go up in Space with Mars Global Surveyor to photograph Cydonia. On April 5, 1998 the Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Carmera snapped a picture the best they could. Jim Garvin said"" We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a shot."" After looking at the photo, JPL website revealed that....it was just a natural landform.

However, that did not stop the people who believed that it was a sign of life on Mars. They said "" the Face of Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98."" Since it was cloudy around that time of year maybe you couldn't see all the alien markings because they were hidden by the clouds.

Then, Scientist decided to take a better picture with no interuptions or anything in the way. So, on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia in 2001,The Surveyor captured an amazing photo. ""Malin""s team captured an extradorinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" said Garvin. ""Each pixle in the 2001 image spans to 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meter per pixle in the best 1976 Viking photo.""(Unmasking the Face on Mars)

In conculsion, The face on Mars is a natural landform. Scientist took 3 photos to prove it. Others may still believe that the face is life on Mars, but scientist have proven it is just another natural landform on Mars.                        ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
9865A4972C51,"The Face that appeared on Mars was something that all of us would never forget. We didn't know how it appeared or why it appeared, but we were going to figure it out. Some scientist including me think it was just a natural landform. Other scientist think it was created by aliens,but I highly doubt it was.

I'm here working with one of the other scientist, and we're talking about the Face that appeared on Mars. The scientist thinks that the face was madeby aliens but I think it wasn't that it's just a natural landform.

It was a natural landform because the caption that we put for people to see was "" huge rock formation..... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The face was just a rock formation that gave the illusion of the eyes, nose, and mouth becuse it was just a shadow that we were seeing.

However the scientist doesn't think that. He thinks that the face was made by aliens. He says that there is no way it was just a natural landform that aliens made this as a sign for something.

He believes that it was a sign for something that the aliens were going to end up doing. But I told him that it was a natural landform because when we waited to get the best picture in 1998 all we saw was a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

But of course not everyone was satisfied.

It was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.

I think even though some people still may think it was made by aliens, we all know that it is just a natural landform and it wasn't made by aliens.

I after all did convince the scientist that I was working with, that the Face was just a natural landform and it wasn't made by aliens .

Their studies and pictures have concluded that the Face on Mars is a huge rock formation. Even though scientists have proved this theory, people still believe otherwise. It all started in 1976 when NASA unveiled the image for all to see.

NASA found a huge landform made of rock on Mars in 1976. The landform was found on a region of Mars called Cydonia. This landform came as a surprise to everyone. Large rock formations were common in this region of Mars, but something stood out to NASA when they came across this rcok formation. This landform looked like a giant face. Scientists didn't know if it was an alien artifact or if the shadows and the way the rock formed just made it look like a face. There was no way to tell other than the photo's taken from space. NASA had to keep investigating this to come up with an explanation for this ""face"" on Mars. So in 1998 they took another picture of the rock formation that was better quality. They still couldn't tell what it was because it was very cloudy on Mars the day they took the picture. They had one more shot to get a good image of the landform. In 2001, NASA took one last picture and they found out what the rock formation really was.

Just as they had predicted, it was a mesa. Which was common for the area on Mars where they found it. Even though scientists knew it was a mesa, conspiracy theorists still believed it could be an alien artifact. There are many signs that prove that this rock formation is not an alien artifact. First of all scientists have ruled it out as an alien artifact. They have done research on this ""face"" for over 20 years and they have proved it's a huge rock formation. People have always wondered how and why the face appears if it's a mesa. Well the face is created by shadows. These shadows give the illusions of the eyes, nose, and mouth. Scientists have also told us that things in a digital image are 3 times bigger than their actual pixel size. This tells us that if there were some type of pyramid, alien object, or airplanes on the ground we would be able to see them.

The Face on Mars will always be a controversy to some people, but scientists have proof of what the face actually is, a mesa. The pictures you see are actually showing a Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa. These rock formations are commonly found on Mars and on Earth.

Tectonic plates cause many different landforms to form when they shift and move around. If tectonic plates create landforms on Earth that no human can, it should be reasonable to think that tectonic plates can be the cause of landforms on Mars.

Secondly, Mars has similar landforms to the landforms on Earth. Just like Earth, Mars has volcanoes, mountains, and canals. Scientist have found that tectonic plates are the cause of many of the landforms we see on Earth today. For example, mountains are formed when two tectonic plates collide and push against each other, trying to push the opposing plate underneath. If none of the plates budge, the plates will begin to push each other up tho form mountains. For canals to form, water would have to run over the land for a while and erode the rocks until a ditch forms. Even though there isn't water on Mars now, scientist have proved that water has once been on Mars. Since water and tectonic plates cause landforms on Earth, the same elements must cause landforms on Mars as well.

Even though I believe that the Face is a natural landform, many other people will disagree with that statement. Many people with opposing viewpoints from mine will say that aliens built the face. Firstly, there is no scientific evidence to even prove the existence of aliens. Secondly, the pictures from the space crafts show no sign of any civilization near by the Face. On Earth, we may have ancient Pyramids that weren't formed naturally, but there were civilizations around those pyramids. Around the Face on Mars there is no sign of any villages or aliens living there. With a Bird-eye view, the face does't seem to have any human facial features. Only when there is a shadow, the features of a human being appear. This makes the Face seem like it was just a coincidence that it had terestrial features. With the lack of evidence to support the claim that aliens made the Face on Mars, it is hard to believe that such an idea could be true.

In conclusion, I believe the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because there are landforms on Earth that are the same as those on Mars and those landforms were made from tectonic plates and water. I believe that you look at the evidence provided to you before you draw any conclusions. ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
81BC51842FBB,"This face has been the talk of NASA and the talk of headlines for quite sometime. The topic has been argued many times and there are many different opinions on whether or not its a face or a natural landform. What do you think?

The discussions of this being a face are all over the place, poeple believe that ailens have caused this ""face"" on Mars surface. There are three different pictures, one from 1976, one from 1998, and one from 2001. In the first pictuere you see a outline of a face and a mouth, but back in the 70's the quality of technology wasn't very advanced. In the first photo, due to poor quality, it is just a land mass that has trhe outline of a face. There is no form of life on Mars, otherwise, NASA would have detected in years ago. In the article it says that the camera that was used to capture the 1976 photo only had 43 meters per pixel, in other words meaning that there's almost no way in telling what the first picture was or resembled.

In 1998 and 2001, you can see the picture more clearly due to the advancement in technology you clean clearly see that there is no outline or resembalance of a face. The Face is nothing but a landmass, the scientific name: A mesa. In the '98 photo the picture is foggy and unclear because it was winter on Mars and they had to take a photo through a cloud. When the photographs began to be released online there was many observations but many realized it was infacr not a face.

After all the questions blew over, Directors began putting images and shots into movies which again started raising talk. In movies or films there are special effects people that are able to enchance photos and clips. So most of the photographs and clips are not actually NASA recorded and theres a good chance most of them had been edited to make more money on a film or movie because people want to know more about myterious things like this.

Concluding with what i said at the beginning, the pictures we see are nothing more than a mesa. Science it to greatly advanced now and if there was any form of life on any other planets NASA would atleast have an idea of it. I don't believe this is an alien artifact, because Mars cannot support life.          ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

A434E6F14DB4,"'Umasking the face on mars' well at NASA we are discussing the face with someone wo thinks it was created by aliens. I would have to disagree to that. My arguement would be that it is just a natural landform.

Why do i say it is just a natural landform well because aliens arent real. Also in 1976 you could barely tell it would happen to look like a face way after 2001. If aleins would have created that then when they first created it then why did it not look like a face then? It's just a natural landform that was formed into a face.

In 1976 it just looks like lump on the ground and in 1998 you cant even see where the eyes nose and mouth would be and if they would of created it then surely they would of made it more noticeble. In 2001 it looks like a turtle shell , it has cracks in it and is shap almost like an oval but not excatly and i say an oval because there is no sharp edges. The reason i am explaining the shape and apperacance is because if someone were to creat a face it would take years to form out into one. Later on in the years it doesn look like a face but im gonna disagree on it wasnt created by aleins it is just a natrual landform.

That was my argument on aleins did not creat the face that it is just a natrual landform. It formed into looking like a face but didnt right when someone first saw it so there for how could any know it was suppose to be a face like i said. It just shaped into one over the years. Then people wanna make an opinion that is on aleins creating it. I think it is just a natural landform.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

A954E3B54194,"Brock was walking in the woods along the creek. At the edge of the water, he saw something that made a body type figure. Brock went down to see if it was a body, but when he got down there, it was really hard to see if it was a body because of the running water. He went back up to where he saw the body, and he coud see it clearly again. He took a picture of the body figure and sent it to the Elkart County Lab. They went to take a look at it and they posted the picture sent from Brock online. Most of the people who saw it, including some of the scientist, thought it was some sort of alien figure. They dug it out and found it to be a rock formed into a body shape by the shadows of the water, and the erosion that has been done to the rock. I believe that the Face on Mars is just a natural landform because it isn't an alien formation, you can see what it is made of, and there are other landforms that may look real, but it isn't real.

One example that proves my claim is that the author explains in the excerpt that it isn't an alien formation. The author states that Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. This photo revealed that it was just a natural landform, not an alien monument. The author also states that it has unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Another example that demonstrates my claim is that according to the author, you can see what it is made of. The author shows that the huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, is formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The author also states that Garvin said, ""as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like, airplaines on the ground, or Egytian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

A final example that proves my claim is that the author demonstrates that there are other landforms that may look real, but it isn't real. The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze.

As we already know Mother Nature can do things like this.

4D1E6E8521D9,"Have you ever thought that there are aliens in space?

Many people believe that the Face on Mars was created by aliens. The Face on Mars was not created by aliens due to it's common landform shade.

Mars Global Surveyor was used to take pictures of Mars. The picture showed the Face was the equivalent to the size of a butte or mesa. Butte or mesas are common landforms around the American West. A famous one is the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Martain mesas are very common around Cydonia. Cydonia is a region of Mars. It is not uncommon for a rock formation to resemble something like a face. The shadows on Cydonia gave the illusion of eyes, nose and a mouth on the natural rock formation.

People who support that the Face was created by aliens believe that there is life on Mars and that NASA is hiding this information. This is not true. NASA wishes that there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Life on Mars would be great business for NASA and they would have no reason to hide it from the public.

The first picture of the Face was taken in 1976. Eighteen years later, Mars Global Surveyor landed on the Red Planet. The technonlogy was way more advanced now. The NASA scientists were able to get a picture ten times sharper that the orginal Viking photo. This proved to the thousands of waiting web sufers that the Face was a natural landform.

The Face is a natural landform. Scientists at NASA have spent years finding evidence to prove that the Face is a natural landform. As of 2001, the Face was proven to be a natural landform and that there are no aliens on Mars.            ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
C374ED6F1DD1,"On May 24, 2001 something strange happened on Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft circled the planet, looking for possible landing sites for Viking 2, when it captured a human face lurking on the ground of Mars. An enormous head seemed to stare back at the cameras from Cydonia. The NASA scientists soon found out it was not an alien marking. The Face is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa.

To begin, The Face natural landform is not the only Martian mesa in Cydonia. This region of Mars is actually quite common for having these weird Martian mesas. This mesa was different from the others with ""unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh(2)."" This information led to the research of an ancient civilization on Mars. The research found that there was not an ancient civilization, although many people wish their would have been.

Since many people wanted to find an ancient civilization, conspiracy theorists hoped to prove NASA wrong. The theorists began to throw false accusations at NASA including, ""Some people think the Face is a bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists(5)."" NASA defenders stated that they wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars and that they would not lie. NASA flew over Cydonia once again and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the originial Viking photos. The picture proved that it was just a natural landform. This didn't stop the conspiracy theorists from pushing forward.

To conclude, the theorists believed that since there was a haze on Mars when they took the photo, that the haze could potentially hide ancient Martian markings. This kept NASA pushing harder into their research. ""Neverless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look(10)."" NASA rolled the spacecraft to center the Face in the field of view. They took a picture with extraordinary resolution. If anyone could see anything they could see it. NASA concluded that the Face was equivalent to a butte or mesa- landforms commonly found in the American West.

The Face is just a natural landform called a Martian mesa. The trips NASA took around Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform commonly found in Cydonia.

0AEBFEF5CE4B,"Mars has always been a big part in our curiosity for outer space. We are always secretly hoping that there is some form of life out there other than down here. I do believe that this face is a natural landform because the picture quality back then was not all too great, this place is known for it's ""Martian mesa's"", and they only unveiled it to the general public for attention and hopefully more money in their funding.

I believe that this ""face"" so to speak is actually just another lanform on the terrain that is Mars. I believe that it is a landform becase as you can see the picture quality in 1976 is much more different than the quality of the picture in 2001. That said, Mars is known for it's powerful windstorms, so the earth could have shifted over time. That just makes it even more of a landform though.

I also believe that this so called ""face"" is not an actual face because the scientists stated that in the region of Cydonia it was common to find what they call ""Martain mesas"" which means it just so happens to be another freaky concidence instead of some actual huge martian face. Not even the actual scientists believed that it was an actual martian. They did think so for a short while and they're honestly dumb. In my opinion, until the day where some other form of life comes down to Earth, there is no such way there could be martian life.

I believe that this isn't an actual face also because NASA unveiled it to the general public just for attention and possibly some money. Let's face it, NASA doesn't get very much funding. I'm guessing that they unveiled it to the public for attention saying ""look at me, look at me I'm some important Martian face and you should give the people who found me more money so they can find other things like me with better equipment."" Which in my opinion it's just plain sad. Don't get me wrong I support NASA all the way, but when they have to do something like this just to get fame and perchance a little bit of money, it's a little sad.

We all know that with more fame comes more money (let's not talk about Kanye West shall we?) There are people like Selena Gomez and Donald Trump who have so much money from all the fame they're getting. When in reality they aren't contributing much to society except for the fact that they are just spewing a lot of junk out of their mouths. Whereto people working at places such as NASA have not very much funding and are still attempting to change the world, which is really really beautiul.

In the end, this ""face"" is nothing but a silly little landform on the face of Mars. I still firmly believe it because the picture quality back then was not all too great, this place is known for it's ""Martian mesa's"", and they only unveiled it to the general public for attention and hopefully more money in their funding. This is the sad truth in this whole operation, but it is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

C151B54B30ED,"What is your view on the ""Face of Mars?"" This is a very interesting topic. There are many different points of view for the ""Face on Mars."" Although, there are two main concepts. The first is based off of research. Many people at NASA believe in this point of view. The people that believe this idea is true and think that the face is just a natural landform. The second is based off of conspiracy. This idea is based off of external life outside of Earth. The people that believe in this point of view think that aliens have created this landform.

I myself believe in the research part of the concept. There is just not enough physical evidence to say that it is aliens. This is just an idea that many conspiracy theorists believe. Sometimes their theories can be a little enticing, but they never really have any evidence to back up any of it. The idea of aliens making this lanform had been created by some ""very creative"" minds and was probably thought of when the pictures weren't high enough quality to make anything out of them.

Now lets say that there are aliens living on Mars. In order for them to make this landform, they would have to know about humans. They would have to know what a human face looked like. They would also have to know that we are smart enough to be studying them and they would have to be smart enough to study us. The chances of them finding out all of this information without ever getting recognized by anybody are slim to none. Again, it all coms back to research. There is no evidence of aliens. Therefore, nobody can argue that this landform was made by life outside of Earth.

Now personally, I agree with the scientists that had first discovered this ""Face on Mars."" This is just merely another Martian Mesa. The odd shadows are common around Cydonia and it just happened to be an odd combination of them. I honestly think that is all there is to it.

Now what do you believe? Do you think it is an alien artifact? Or is it just a natural lanform? I hope this persuaded you to think on the more scientific side of things, because trust me it will help you in the long run.         ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

There are many clues that the face was created by natural landform. Also many people can disagree with me, but I will prove to you that it was not created by aliens.

Many people thought that the face was created by aliens because at the time they did not have much eveadince of it was real or not. They thought that unusal shadows made it look like an Egyptin Pharaoh. We then showed people the pictures of the so what called face. It became a big hit everywhere, and people loved it. Some people thought it led to maybe living things being there. It then became an acient civlazation on mars.

These fine pictures would be much sharper, and they would capture more evedince. 1,000s of people waited to see what the fastinting pictures would bring a new. It revealed a natural landform and there came to be no alien monument after all. Many people were disapointed. They wanted to belive that it was real. Well, I am here to tell you that it is not real.

As you can tell there was a lot of dispute going on. Some people did not want to belive that it was not real. They wanted to keep trying. They then wanted to take a second look. The poeple wanted to make sure that we did not miss anything. We had an extraordinary photo that had pixel spans that were 1.56 meters. That was much better compared to1976 when the yfirst took the picturses.

What the picture actually showed was land forms that were common around the Amercian West.

Now do you see why the face was not created by aliens. Yes, maybe at one point in time it seemed like it could of been real, but all in the end it was not.

They accused us of hiding the fact that there was an alien civilization on the Red Planet, and that the picture is a monument. All we want to do here at NASA is inform skeptics that they are severely mistaken.

First of all, we revealed the information because we wanted the public to be informed, and we wanted to not hide anything. All the skeptics should stop and realize that us revealing partial information is just illogical. If we revealed the picture, it's because we wanted people to know about it. As we said earlier, the face-type shape is ""formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" We gave you the full truth.

As well as us giving you full information, we actually would be glad to tell the public about ancient martian civilizations. NASA would benefit greatly from something like that. You see, we aren't getting funded as well as we would like. So something as interesting as alien life-forms would definitely get us more money to explore more. Simply put, the public's thirst for exciting information would drive the government to fund us. Unfortunately, the face is just a creation of nature, but we'll be more than glad to inform you if we ever find signs of alien life.

In addition to the fact that NASA is always glad to provide information, we took very clear pictures that show just a desolate mound of rock that is naturally made.

A Martian mesa. That's all the face is. It was created by a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated messa, with shadows that give it the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Martian mesas, are common enough around Cydonia, which is another reason why this could'nt have been created by aliens. Lastly, this couldn't have been aliens, because there is not enough scientific proof to even know if there is even any form of life on mars. The face is just a huge rock formation, with shadows that give you the illusion of facial features.

Even though most people believe that it is a natural landform, some do believe it was aliens who created it. One reason is because, it is more benitfital for Nasa to keep quiet, and say it is a natural landform. Another reason is because, the face looks more like an alien face than a natural landform. Although there is more proof that it is a natural landform, that face could have been made by aliens.

All in all the face appears to be a natural landform. Some people may disagree but, there is more facts and research, that the face is a natural landform. Although there is more facts about it being a natural lansdform, some people still will think it could have been aliens who created the face.

5CE722A3188C,"I believe that the face is just a natural landform. There are no facts to prove that aliens created that. Also there are also no facts to prove aliens didnt make that landform on Mars. I will still continue to believe that it is just a natural landform created by the planet Mars in earlier years.

I can prove my arguement in many ways. For example, it states in the text that "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Vikings photo. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting, when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing. . . a natural landform"". Just that last sentence alone can make my arguement 10 times better. That statement proves to us it was just a natural landform. In addition to this, in the article it states "" there was no alien monument after all."". Which tells us there was never alien monument and that never was made by aliens.

As you can see in the picture, it looks pretty old. Which should really show everyone something. The photo as taken in 1976. With our newer, more advanced cameras it shows that its just a natural landform on Mars. In the article it states that "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pryamids or even small shacks, you can see wwhat they were!"". Which means if we really wanted to, we can capture a picture of the so called ""face"" or natural landform. Also then we would be able to prove what it is and what it is not.

There are many other reasons why this arguement can be won by either side, but there is never a true answer until someone goes onto the planet Mars and takes a look at the face or landform in person. in fact, I will always stand my ground and say it is just a natural landform on Mars.

NASA is a program that would like more funding than already grated. If there is a major space break through NASA, would be grated a funding boost. NASA would not hide the sign of life from the public's eyes. NASA, most likely, would want to promote life in space.

1037273E86D9,"The curiousity about Mars has been going on for centuries.

People say that there is or once was life on Mars, and now they are saying that there is a face on Mars.

Humans all around the world have questioned whether the ""Face"" was created by aliens or just a natural landform.

Well calm down earthlings, it's just a natural landform.

In 1976, Viking 1 took photos of Mars and found a huge rock formation that remebled a human head with shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.

This was soon to be known as the ""Face on Mars"".

People made a huge deal out of it.

The ""Face on Mars"" appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows.

Some people even say it appeared in haunted grocery store checkouts.

On April 5, 1998, NASA's MGS flew over Cydonia, the siting of the face, to snap more picture to reveal that the Face was just a natural landform and nothing more.

The majority of people accepted this statement, but there was a select few people who say that aliens made the Face.

The Face Theorists weren't satisfied with it being just a landform and tried to find evidence to prove NASA wrong.

The Face Theorists found out that the location and date of the April '98 photo was during a cloudy winter.

Skeptics said that the alien markings were hidden by the haze. Three years later, NASA proved our skeptical theorists wrong again. With advanced technology, the right location, and the right season, NASA got the clear picture of the Face they needed to show that it was just a landform.

NASA even suggests that it may be a butte or mesa.

Sorry Face Theorists, but NASA

has crushed your dreams multiple times.

2152510D0242,"The face on Mars is 100% just a natural formation of rocks and sand/dust. Pictures show this, everytime NASA does take a picture of it there are the same results. Plus if it was alien why would NASA publish the pictures. If this was proof of aliens it would put people into freak out mode.

The first thing is that giant rock formations aren't uncommon in the cydonia section of Mars. In fact there are a whole bunch of different kinds of rocks just like the face, only that those are normal looking. They don't look like faces. The article even says that the picture actually shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. Even Garvin says ''It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,'' then he keeps going to say ''That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.''

The second thing is close up images. Over the years NASA has been taking pictures of this formation. Each time they take a picture of face, the face starts to look more and more like a rock formation. NASA even publicly posted pictures on the web, and all diferent kinds of media to show what the formation looks like. So, NASA must of been pretty confident in what they were saying the picture was. Plus NASA is made of the top of the line professionlas. They aren't made up of people who dropped out of highschool. They are made up of people who have graduated from some of the most advanced and instutionalized colleges.

My third thing is if it was alien, why would NASA publicly show the pictures. In the article, it makes NASA look like they were trying to get people to get away from the alien idea. By the sound of it, I would take a guess and say if it was alien, NASA would do everything in their power to keep the images from getting out into the public. Another thing is that at one point people were saying that the picture taken on April 5, 1998, was not liable because of the fact that 98 was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. So, NASA on April 8, 2001, took another photo in the year 2001 and 2001 was not a cloudy year for the Red Planet .The photo even further backed up the fact that the formation on Mars is just another giant rock, not some alien face or artifact.

So in the end why would this be an alien face or aritfact. NASA has publicly proven that it is just a formation of rocks and dust/sand. Plus if NASA didn't wan't us to know about aliens or anything of the sort, why would they publicly anounce and show pictures of the Face of Mars. That is why the Face of Mars is not related to anything alien at all and is just another formation in the cydonia sector of Mars.  ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
ECF8ACDDB004,"Mars has many landforms, but there is a particular one that is peculiar. The landfrom is known as The Face. The Face was spotted by a space surveyor in 1976 and has been a mystery to the world ever since. Some people say that this landform was made by alien life on Mars, but with facts from NASA and other sources you could see that those people are wrong.

The Face has had many theories made up about how it was made and if it is even real. One of these theories is about how or who created it. This theory is about how NASA is hiding the fact that the face was made by some type of alien lifeform, which logically makes no sense at all. Finding life on another planet would bring in a gargantuan amount of money for NASA so it would seem completely illminded to hide something like this from the people. NASA can only wish they knew about an alien lifeform.

With this new discovery people and scientists demanded for more proof on how it was made. Throughout the knowing of this landform three pictures were taken of it. The first of pictures was in 1976 when they first found it and camera quality was not very good. With not a clear image, and the need for answers, NASA sought out for another picture and got one during a cloudy winter day in 1988. This picture did come out clearer than the other but still was not perfect for scientist and people to be one-hundred percent sure how it was made. So the wait began to get another picture. Finally in two-thousand-one NASA used a new, high-resolution, three-dimensional camera to take an outstanding clear photo of what they concluded to be a mesa, common in the American West, just with the physical pheatures of a human face.

In conclusion this outstanding land form on Mars had the world stuck asking this question, ""Is there alien life on mars?"" The Face was a mystery to science for almost thirty years only to be proven to be just another landform on Mars. To conclude, this landform is nothing more than a naturally occuring lava dome.

Many people say that The Face on Mars is just a legend, but we have scientifical proof of a face on Mars. The Face on Mars isn't an alien creation, but it is a natural landmark.

The Face on Mars is a natural landmark. It's a natural landmark because not only has it been there for a long time, but over the years we have found that it is a natural landform not an alien monument(JPL website). Many Hollywood movies have used the term ""that face on Mars,"" but many people think that the face is evidence of life on Mars. Some scientists have compared the face to landmarks in the USA called buttes or a mesa. Many people also say that the face resembles an Egyptian Pharoah.

On the other hand, some people specifically NASA has used The Face on Mars as a way to show that some things are important for taxpayers to see. Like I mentioned before Hollywood has made many big selling movies about The Face on Mars. Also, many books and magazines have used The Face as a headliner. Some NASA defenders has said that they wish there was some sort of an ancient civilization on Mars to use as a motive.

The Face on Mars is a cool natural landmark. It was located in Cydonia an area of Mars. The Face isn't a legend at all. There is real scientific proof of a face. The Face on Mars isn't a hoax either.

They evan used a special camera that zooms in very close to the planet. They still saw that the planets face was nothing more than a landform.

First of all, the cameras that are used are the best they can possibly make.

It can even see if there were to be small objects near the Face.

They've used those cameras and they didn't see anything that proved to be life-like.

AA6D6F1B1B54,"The Landform that Looks like a Face

On Earth, there are many landforms that might look like a person or a thing. On Mars, there is a landform that looks like a face. This Face has had several photos of it taken by Viking 1 in 1976, a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) in 1998, and another (MGS) in 2001. The Face looks like a face because of its characteristics. Although it looks like an enourmous head, it is really just a mesa or butte, a landform, that happens to look like a face.

One reason that this landform is not a face is because NASA revealed a close up picture of the face, revealing only a landform. That picture had a caption that stated, ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Before, there were pictures that weren't as high resolution, so it looked like a face but is now proven to be just a landform. This shows that the landform that looks like a face, is just a landform since there is a photo that shows what the ""face"" actually is. This means the face is just a mesa or butte.

Another reason why this Face is just a natural landform, is because this landform is in Cydonia where mesas are common. The text states, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian pharoah."" This shows that mesas in Cydonia are common. Also, the mesa just had unusual shadows that gave it the appearence of a face. This means that this face was just a landform.

Another reason, is that some landforms, like on Earth look like something other than a landform. The text states, ""'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.', says Garvin."" This shows that some landforms can represent or look different from what it really is. This would be the Face oon Mars that is a landform. This wouldn't be a face.

Though some people, like cospiracy theorists, may say that NASA wants to hide a type of evidence for life on Mars, they are wrong. The text states,""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence for life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say cospiracy theorists."" The text also states, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" NASA responds to conspiracy theorist in this way, because if NASA were to be responsible for discovering life on Mars, they would benefit. This shows that though NASA would like to be responsible fo discovering life on Mars, NASA just wanted to prove that this Face is just a natural landform.

Overall, there are several reasons why this Face is just a natural landform. One of them is that NASA took a picture of the Face, revealing just a landform. Another reason, is that mesas are common in Cydonia, the area where the Face was found. Another reason, is that thhis landfprm like others can look different from what it really is.

The face on mars is a landformation because natural occurances happen. This could have happend fromm a meteor strike or the winds in Mars. Not to mention if the clouds in mars are constant then finding this twice on over a 20 year period should still be the same fro slow winds and mild weater.

Life forms take upon millions of years to grow and need about 60 degree weather on average and mars has below freezing average. Plus if theree were life on Mars, there should be green on Mars because of plants. People also think its aliens because of the lattitude changed.

Theface is indeed a natrual landform, how? because if you go by the diffrent images included in the article you notice the cleared the images,the face slowly dissapears or fade away. The Face can also appear by things in spaces or objects reflecting unto the mesa.

There are many landforms in Mars and the Face happens to be one. For people to say that aliens are the ones causing it to look like a Face is also a arguement. Why ould support this detail? because of so many life forms on Earth people assume that someone had to make that happen. Perhaps aliens did indeeds have something to do with the ""Face"" , why would they make so clearly and if they did , why did updated cameras show that the clearer the image the face slowly decided to dissapear.

On the other hand there are people who support the fact that the Face is just another landform on Mars. Well as you can tell Mars always had many landforms and The Face happens to be one. How can you prove that? people might ask. Well when Viking caught the images of the Face, ot certainally goes along with the fact that it does look like a FAce but agai the clearer the image got, the face slowly dissaper. When the face does disspear, slowly the landform starts to look like all the other landforms on

Mars or mesas.

Mant people doubt the fact that it is alien, why? because you usually do not see aliens in sight, unless you are watching a movie or reading a book about them.

Aliens could hav eindeed built it , but there has not been an actual sighting on aliens anywhere on Earth, and aliens are usually portrayed as bad people or ting sin movies or books so seeing that a Face on Mars is created by a alien would be kind of frightning because if they are portrayes as bad thing , why would they want a face on a landform. What does that mean?

Now on my side of the story or opinion it clearly looks like a landform and the way it got it's ""face"" was by something reflecting off an object and making it seem like someone had of built that,

But again. those images do not show anything about a face and how could have ""aliens"" buolt something so clearly and so presised. The clues just don't go together.

I think that we think it has something to do with aliens because it is in a face shape like us. But honestly, huge rocks or huge meterorites could have caused it to look like that. Also there hasn't been any sight of life on Mars because of the conditions. If humans couldn't live on Mars, then how could aliens?

Huge rocks and huge meters crash into the planets and moon all the time. I honestly think that it is the rocks or something in space that caused this. I don't think that there is any sight or any posssible way that there could be life or aliens on this planet.

When they went to go see again and go check out the ""Face on Mars"" they didn't see anything, there was no alien monument. They also talk about how it is very hard to be able to see the ""Face on Mars"" I think that if there was a possiblity that it could be a bout aliens and this ""Face on Mars"" appeared because of aliens then there wouldn't onlly be one face. I think that if there were tons of face looking landforms then maybe there could've been life on mars for aliens.

If you could make things larger and see farther into the picture than I think there would've been more to find. There wasn't any other sign of aliens found in the picture. I think aliens for sure having nothing to do with this, but at the same time they could have.

I think if scientists really were able to go and see this i think they should study the face more often to see if there is any evidence of any other alien or any other landform that has to do with them.

In April 5, 1998 when we snapped some pictures ten times as better than the Viking did we notice that it was just a landform a big rock formation. The location of the Face of Mars is 41 degrees north martian latitude where it is winter in April on Mars very cloudy during this time so lots of winds,and dust blow past and covers the rock formation.

BF08EB9EBE3D,"""The Face"" is a land formation and my proof is that NASAHas sent astronauts in tospace to orbit Mars, and these astronauts ahve taken many pictrures. These picturesclearly show that it is a land formation. Also NASA has taken high resolution images and used 3D altimetry photos. The pictures they have taken with them clearly show that it is a land formation.

Some information in the text states that when they put pictures of ""The face on the internet that it revealed a land formation. Other information statesthat theyb took photoes of ""The Face with digital images, which enhances the picture three times more than a pixel picture. It also statesthat that NASA took a photo with ""absolute maximum resolution. So this picture clearly depicts ""The Face"" as a land formation. Then the article goes on to say that if there were anything around ""The Face that it would be very clear and easy to see, such as airplanes,shacks, and pyramids.

The article then says that it is the ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Both of these examples are natural land formations made over time,and since that it has been proven of water on Mars what if the surrounding area of ""The Face"" eroded but ""The face didn't.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
E61D1C3EC9DD,"Do you think aliens exsist? The face has been said to be a natural landform or made by aliens. The face has been told from different perspectives. Conspiracy theorists thinks NASA wants to hide the face, when they really dont. There's different stand points for different topics.

The Face on Mars is a mystery because we dont know if the face is there or is it shadows. In my opinion I think that the face is a natural landform like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. the face has also been seen as a pop icon, it has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows. Defenders of the national budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Maybe there is life maybe there's not who knows for sure.

Eighteen long years after Viking missions, we sent up the Global Surveyor. Once the it was in place for a good shot we took it ten times which were sharper than the viking photos. After the photos were posted on the web there was no congergations about aliens anymore. It was proven to be a natural landform after all. But not everyone was satisfied with the pictures.

The Face on mars is located at 41 degrees north martian lattitude where it was winter in April '98--a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. People still thought that it was an alien making that was hidden in the clouds. The team got another great look at it with the clearest view ever on a summer day and snapped a photo. The photo actually showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Still think its real or not?

In my opinon I believe the Face is real. Others might argue that its still something crated by aliens. Especially sense it was clearified as a butte or mesa. No matter what its an opinon based topic that you can argue about all day. The real question is what do you think?

In conclusion there has been plenty of research and examinations on the Face of Mars. I still think that the Face is real, others might think differently. This topic can go both ways in opinon wise. Think wise about this topic. Consider talking about it with coleagues and come up with a conclusion for this topic.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform. Like many other NASA scientist i do not beleive that it was an made by ancient civilazations of aliens. The pictures that we have taken from the planet Mars first indicated a type of face. But now that with our newer technology we've seen that it is just a mesa or butte. NASA has even provided real photos taken on the Mars. But still, many disagree that it is simply just a landform.

Nasa sending out the Viking 1 and bringing back that picture has made a big impact on NASA. Alot of scientist did not beleive that it was a face. But ""the Face on Mars"" has become a pop icon. This ""Face on Mars"" starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout linesfor 25 years. But NASA scientist were still a bit doubtfull.

In 1998 NASA felt that it was important to tax payers to see the for sure if the ""the Face on Mars"" was really a face at all. When Mars Global Surveyor(MGS) flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural alndform. So all these people believed that it was a face but it actually turned out, from real pictures taken, to be a landform.

But still not evryone was content with that. The ""Face on Mars"" is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998-a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet. The camera that took the last picture of the ""Face on Mars"" had to peer through wispy clouds to see the ""Face"". So in April 8, 2001-a clodless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. And once again the even more advanced picture of the ""Face on Mars"" looked like a mesa or a butte.

Now some people will say that NASA is trying to cover up something, that they are hiding something from the public. Others say that NASA doesn't want people to know if there are aliens out there. But what people lack in that accusation is the fact that if NASA would've discovered aliens, it would be one of the most popular and profitable organizations on Earth. NASA trying to verify, by spending millions of dollars on global surveyors to take pictures of Cydonia, if the ""Face on Mars"" is really a face is not them trying to hide anything. In fact its NASA trying to satisfy the public in best ways they can. And people even say that the pictures arent good enough to tell for sure. NASA's surveyor's camera pixel in 2001 had a span of 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

So in conclusion, even though you dont beleive that its a natural landform, and i understand why, facts and real photos beg to differ that idea of a face on the Mars. All the times NASA has sent out surveyors to bring pictures to the public, the public just gave them garbage. So honestly all i can say is that all the facts and pictures that NASA has provided us with to understand the face or landform is for a reason. And thats so people can see and decide for themselves wheather it a face or a landform. But really if a scientist and an entire corporation of intellegiant scientist with high degrees say its a landform, then that they're aren't going to lie to an entire planet of people.

5ACC0F9409A6,"The Face on Mars was a natural creation. It is similar to the Middle Butte landform in Snake RIver Plain of Idaho. The facial features was created by shadows makily it look eerely like a face. The features of the Face are an optical illusion. NASA concluded that it was not made by aliens.

The Face is similar to teh Middle Butte. The Middle Butte is a lava dome that takes the form of a face. The landforms are common around the western parts of the United States. The picture shows a face that could only be like the Middle Butte in Snake River Plain in Idaho. This is how the Face could be a natural feature. The Middle Butte from Idaho was formed when lava and the earth combined and made it look like a face when you are on Google Earth. The Face on Mars is just like the Middle Butte that is in Idaho. It is possible that there was once lava or a liquid that combined with the surface to make a facial feature that you see when you look at the Face on Mars. The Face on Mars is also not very well detailed. If it was a monument then it would have detail. It would have eyebrows or details around the mouth and eyes so it resembled a certain person. This is how the Middle Butte on Mars is a natural figure.

The Face was an optical issusion. There was shadows that made the Face look relatively similar to a human face. The shadows also could have been formed by the clouds that were blocking the view of Viking for a while. The Viking had to get closer to take a picture of the natural landform. The landform could have been just a pile of dirt or a pile of rocks that had holes that made it look simillar to a face. Some people argue that the alien markings were hidden by the hazey clouds. When the Viking went over the Face it only took a few pictures. When the Mars Global Surveyor went over Cydonia for the first time they snapped a picture 10 times better than the original Viking picture. The picture from Mars Global Surveyor had better quality than the picture from Viking. This is how the clouds and the camera on the Viking made an optical illusion.

NASA concluded that the Face was not like the Egytian style pyramids. They came to a decision that the Face was just a landform that under the certain circumstances looked like a face. The people at NASA also said that the camera had zoomed in so that if there was a shack or an airplane or a person on the ground that they would be able to see it. NASA even used a different camera that has better zoom than the one used in 1976. The camera used in 1976 was 43 meters per pixel. The one used in 2001 was 1.56 meters per pixel. If they didn't find any proof of alien life with the 2001 image then how can you argue their is any aliens?

In conclusion the Face on Mars is a natural figure. NASA verified that the Face was just an optical issusion. The camera on Viking was not very good compared to the camera of later explore Mars Global. The camera on Mars Global was able to take a picture 10 times better than the one on Viking. The face and eyes and mouth were created by shadows. This is how the Face on Mars is not an alien monument. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
2F5B4EFC880B,"There are many reasons why people would think that the face was created by aliens. There are also many reasons why people would think it is a natural landform. Either way, do we really know what it is?

The face is a very mysterious thing. It's not every day you see something resemble a face on a planet. There are many people out there that believe it is just a natural landform. People think that because there are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face so why think that aliens did it just because it is on another planet. Also they might not belive in aliens.

There are also people who think aliens created it. They think this because it really isn't an everyday think to see a landform that resembles a face. So they start to think what could have created that. Since it is on Mars they instantly think aliens. They think aliens because they can't think of what else could cause that and they think aliens can do crazy things like shape the land. Also people read things from newspaper articles that talk about it and watch movies about aliens and see them do crazy things like shape the land and other crazy things.

People who think the face is just a natural landform probably think the people that believe aliens made it are crazy. They might think they are crazy because there is no proof that aliens exist, so why think that something that might not exist create something like a face in a planet. It makes more sense that it is a natural landform that just so happens to resemble a face. Not many scientists believed it was an alien artifact so many people would think that is a natural landform because scientists don't believe it is something aliens created.

On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his ""Mars Orbiter Camera"" took a picture of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the original and it proved that it was just a natural landform. People who believed aliens created it were unsatisfied because the way Mars faced in 98' it was winter time. So it was very cloudy. But on April 8, 2001 he set out for another picture. They took an extrodinary picture. Again it proved it was just a landform. So therefore the people who thought it was just a landform were correct.

In conclusion people had many reasons to believe what they believed. Michael Malin had to find out the answer and find out what exaclty made it. That's exaclty what he did. He found out it was just a landform that resembled a face. But does that mean that the people who believe aliens created it believe that it is just a landorm because of a picture? Maybe not but almost everyone believes/knows it is a landform because of the picture and observations.   ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Resesachers of NASA have done serious reseach over the years just to tell how the Face was created. Pictures have been taking from differnt cameras over the years just to continue the long search on the Face. From, 1976 to 2001, the evidence in the picture has changed everytime.

The article states, "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, "" he added.

I can asure you that it was not aliens. Since the year of 1976 we were able to get better and clearer photos. On March 5, 1998 one of our Mars Surveyor flew over the ""face"" for the first time. Michael Marlin took a picture ten times better than the original image. We thought that would for sure clear up all the alien talk.

Second reason: after the picture was uploaded to the JPL web site they confirmed it was a natural landform. Last reason: what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms.

First reason: the Martian mesa is a common landform around Cydonia. As it says in paragraph two "" The face appeared on their monitors but the sensation was short lived."" Also on paragraph wo it says "" Scientists figured it was just another Mrtian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" Cydonia is a red planet with an abundant amount of Martian mesa's.

That's why i know the face is just a Martian mesa but confusing enough to be taken as an act that aliens might of done.

EBB804B72A0B,"When the first photograph of the ""Face on Mars"" appeared in 1976, researchers and the general public lost their minds. The 'face' was a blurry and shadowy photo from the Viking 1 mission. The photo resembled a human face with eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Dispite all of the scientific and theorietical chaos it created, researchers at the National Areonautics and Space Administration (NASA) discovered that the 'face' was just a matian mesa.

Many people, even today, believe that this natural landform is actually an alien monument. This fallacy lead to many studies, researches, and experiments to find out what the face was. One explaination should cool the heated debated is that NASA is a professional institution built to study this very topic. It is also comprised of educated experts that work to learn and discover more for the rest of the population to learn correctly. However, this is not enough for many people to prove only the plausible.

In ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" the first portion of the article shows 3 compared photographs. These photographs are all of the 'face,' just in 3 different years. The first photo was taken in 1976, the next was in 1998, and the last one was taken in 2001. Each photo perfectly shows a new piece of the 'face' that was not well understood. The first photo shows what does clearly look like a face in the shadows, but as the photos become more recent, the face receads and becomes what looks like a river, or lava system flowig down the sides. These photographs were taken by separate space missions by none other than NASA. These photos are what fueled the conspiracy theorists theories but only because of the lack of information that they had at the time.

In the article, in paragraph 7, it states that on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) had taken the sharpest photo of the time. This photo stood to prove what the NASA researchers were trying to say. The photograph itself proved that there were not alien markings on the 'face' and that it was only a natural landmark. This photo showed that the elements that made up the 'face,' were just ""the Martian Equivalent of a butte or mesa."" (12) It showed small elevated spots on the surface that, from afar and in the shadows, a human-like face appeared around all of it.

However, for some headstrong citizens, this still was not enough to prove what the photo really showed. This lead to the 2001 MGS mission to capture yet another, improved photo of the surface of Mars. The team that which took the photo prided themselves on taking the ""extraordinary photo with the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" (10) In paragraph 10 of the article, it explains that in 2001, the resolution of the photo (1.56 meters per pixel) was beyond fantastic compared to the resolution of the 1976 photo (43 meters per pixel). This comparison is enough to show that in 2001, the landmark could be seen very clearly with the human eye and could be clearly made out as just a landform. The photo was clearly just a bit o' rock jutting out of the surface of Mars.

The 1976 controversy over the ""Face on Mars"" was truely a very heated debate. Starting in 1976 when a blurry image of a face on Mars made it's way through the minds of the Americans, the ""Face on Mars"" was concieved to be an alien relic of some sort. Years later, a new photograph produced by NASA in 1998 began to settle long held debates over the face. It proved to many researchers that this startling human like face was only a natural landmark with a coincedental shape and shadow. This did not, however, settle all of the disputes amongst the ammeture conspiracy theorists. To further prove the point, NASA pushed it's limits in 2001 and took an amazingly sharp photo of the land mark. The photo was pure proof to the nation that the fantisized face was only a small mesa on the surface of Mars. Even today some theorists still try to hold their ground in their thoughts, but it will always be known to science as just a martian mesa that caused some commotion.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
53DE35EAA411,"I would first remind them that when the face on Mars was first shown in a picture, we did not have the greatest technology. This tells us that we cannot assume any thing in the picture to be definite because things may be blurred. This is not a major point to go on, but it is just the beginning.

Next, I would explain that messas are very common on Mars and that the shadows are the only factor that are actually giving an illusion of a face. This strays from from their belief that the face on Mars was created or planted there.

After that, I would simply point out that clearer pictures and better evidence have proven the face on Mars to be ""a huge rock formation....formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

Also, Hollywood has been known to dazzle the mind with some unlikely but fascinating thoughts. Such as the many movies aout the face on Mars pointing the attention to aliens to gain more supporters and the good ratings from the audience. It is basically science fiction. They only provide a perspective from which the human mind can comprehend imagination. Imagining is good, but not with false hope. Books, magazines, and talk shows will do the same thing for similar reasonS. And other propositions from ordinary people for this face on Mars have surely been made over the last twenty-five years.

Then agian in 2001 another team captured a picture of the mesa with a Mars Global Surveyor agian NASA came to the conclusion it was a mesa.

In 1976 a Viking 1 camera captured a bone chilling picture of what looks like a face. As scientists studyed the picture they came to the conclusion that it was an oddly formed mesa that resembled a human face. After they let the picture out to the public the popularity of this mesa sky rocketed it haunted the world for twenty five years before NASA did another expadition to prove it was a mesa.

In 1998 a GOC team captured a picture of this so called face. After further exsamination NASA found the face to be a land form commonly known as a mesa. After studying the mesa the group of scientists compaired the face to mesas in Cydonia, the area the face was found, they came to the conclusion the face was really a mesa that had a peculiar formation.

Then agian in 2001 skeptics lead NASA to do another expadition to capture another picture of the phonomanon. After finding the same evidince as they had the past two times NASA ruled it a mesa. Skeptics had no way of saying the face was anything but a mesa. NASA had proven it three times there was no denying it, the face was a land formation that was rather common were the pictures were taken.

Now NASA could be wrong the pictures could have been edited to contain the secret that there was life on mars. NASA could have tampered with the photographs to mislead the public. But life on mars would be good for NASA, the fact that we are not alone would get NASA the funding to start all kinds of expaditions that would help the United States in the Space race to mars. If there was life on mars NASA would have trillions of dollars to fund there research on the planet. This proves that NASA's findings were correct that the face is a mesa that looks oddly like a human face.

After reading this you should realise the face is nothing more than a mesa land formation that was blown out of preportion.

The face is ether a buute or mesa landforms because it is common around the American West. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Sanke River Plain of Idaho.

4B51E3917E0E,"The face-like structure found on mars is just a natural landform. It looks like landfroms we would find on Earth and the photograph we took in 2001 says the same thing. Consider the following reasons why this landform was not created by aliens.

First of all, the landform looks like a mesa or butte from the American West. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASAs Mars Exploration Program, says ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The author of this article says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" The Face is not made by aliens. It is just a landform the happend to look like a face.

Second reason is this. The landform that looks like a face is the same as the other matian equivalent to buttes of mesas. There are other mesas on Mars it just happens that this one looks like a face. If you look at a 1976 Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars, you see there is another mesa or butte below the Face. This mesa or butte has no special form or image. It is just another mesa or butte. The Face is not made by aliens. It is just a natural landform the happend to look like a face.

The last reason why the Face was not made by aliens is because in 2001 NASA took a new, clear picture that shows the landform is not a face. In 1976 the Viking 1 took a photo that looked like a face. This is where the idea of aliens making the Face came into play. In 1998 a Mars Global surveyor (MGS) took a picture that did not quite look like a face but did not quite look like a nature land form either. It convinced some it was natural and some still believed that it was made by aliens. The author says, ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look...What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West."" The picture of the Face from the MGS in 2001 convinced most people that this was really a natural landform and the Face was just a coincedence.

The Face found on Mars is not made by aliens. It is a natural landform called a mesa or a butte. The picture of 1976 is misleading and out of date. The newest picture taken in 2001 shows the real, updated version. The landform is a mesa not an alien made creation.  ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
3252CF7E78BD,"The Face on Mars is a mystery of how it was created. Know one knows how it was made, if it was created by aliens or just a natural landform. People may think that since it is in space it has to do with aliens in some possible way. Scientist Jim Garvin discovered a landform similar to the Face on Mars. The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the shape of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. They also have discovered that the surveyor has labeled it a natural landform. The Face on Mars is catergorized as a mesa which is around the American West. Could the Face on Mars be a natural landform?

The similar land form in Idaho has the same height as the Face on Mars. The pictures that they have captured shows the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. If this was a alien type of act the MGS would have seen the alien's shelters, airplanes, and pyramids. The Face on Mars is not a alien' s sculpture. NASA's surveyor had labeled the face as a natural landform. The surveyor catergorized it as a natural landform because it didn't pick up any traces of alien activity. Also, if NASA wasn't forsure about their discovery they woudn't have posted it on websites or annonced it to the world. They said that they would have rathered kept this information classified. Why would you put a false statement on the internet, expecially if it involved aliens, because then the world would be going crazy. They would be preparing for them to attack and abduct people.

I could understand why some people could believe that aliens made up this rock like object. One of the most obvious reasons is that it is space. On the day when they wanted to take another picture it was very cloudy and you couldn't see the face, which some believe that aliens had hid the face by a haze. But, we haven't had any discoveries or theroies of there being aliens in this galaxy.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is a natural landform that was not created by aliens.              ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
31DDE751E2BD,"If you read the 1st sentence in the 1st paragraph. You can see it said this picture was taking in 1976 then you see a picture from 2001. The 1976 picture is blury so it look like it a face. But in the second picture it more clear and little zoomed up and you can see cracksand mountian/hills in the ground and does not look anything like a human face. Is it ture?

NASA had released the picture to the public. They had made hollywood movies and book and had went on talk show talkiong about the face saying are there really aliens out there . For over good 25 years alot of people thought there really life on red planet. So NASA really wish there was life on Mars so they invented better camreas and ships to send back to Mars see if there was really life on Mars.

In 1998 they had the on borad MGS taken a few pictures and had look like there was pymarids on mars. Cause of the shadows that the landform was making. 41 degrees north and that winter in april for Mars so there alot of clouds. But nasa had prepared took look one last time they said was super hard and alot of work. Because it like fax machine in narrow 2.5km wide strips. they said it just does not pass over face very often.

""Neverthless on april 8, 2001 it was a cloudy summer day on cydonia Mars Global Surveryor drew just enough for second look they"" said.

Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters pixel from the 1976 vikings photo.

It is a bust the Egyptian-style-pymarids or small shacks. It was a Butte or Mesa landforms. It was shadows or caverns in the landforms.

New technology allowed scientist to get a better look a the ""The Face on Mars"" . With a camra that had high resolution 3D altimetry they finaly discovered what it really was , a mesa . Mars has many natural land forms but this spacific one caught eyes and attention because its looks like a face , but with the shadows and lighting in the first picture in 1976 it looked like an human face.

In 1998 scientist came togeher to and got another picture of ""The Face on Mars "". Then scientist went crazy still beliving that it was a human face , it looked like an egyptian pharoh . With all the features if a human face many bellived stiil it was an human face . Scientist started to belive that there was human life on mars and some how in the future if something was ever to happen to ,humans could find a new life on mars . but that was not the case .

In 2001 the record was finally set striaght . using an hight quality camra they got a very better look at ""The Face on Mars "" . to come to surprise to most scientist it was just and natral land form also known as a mesa .

C5FFE4C79B89,"In the article Unmasking the Face on Mars the face is just a natural landform. The reason this is is because there has been things found like this before. Another is that there is no solid proof that the landform was made by aliens. A third reason is that the people that got the rumor started about all of this are conspiracy theorists.

There has been things like this found in space before. In the article the author states that the sensation of finding the landform was short lived because scientists figured it was just another mesa. Since the scientist said another that means there has been things like this found before. If there has been others found before why is this one so special. The scientist state that they were not actually consstructed there.

Besides that there is actually no solid proof that this landform was made by aliens. That is just an opinion. The fact that it looks lika face is the only reason people believed that the landform was made by aliens. Nobody has ever actually been on mars to investigate this landform and prove that it was made by aliens. The only things we have of it are just pictures. So that means that there is no solid proof that the landform was alien made.

The people that came up with the rumor are conspiracy theorists. That means that the thought of this landform being alien made is just a conspiracy theory. A conspiracy theory is just a buch of bits and pieces of infromation that the theorist put together and think is suppost to mean something. These bits and pieces of infromation are put together even if they didn't happen in chronological order. That means that all a conspiracy theory is is an edjucated guess. Once again that also means there if no solid proof about it.

All three of those reasons go along with the fact that the face looking landform in space is not alien made. All of the rumor about this landform beging alien made are just guesses and theories. With that being said I hope that now people will stop believing everything that people say about this subject unless they have solid proof that what they are saying is true.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

FA56A00B0CC8,"""Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASAs Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" This is an excerpt from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". This is describing a strange feature found on the face of mars in the region of Cydonia.

At first there were no clear pictures of the face and no certain explanations. The Viking 1 found it in 1976 and back then the quality was not so great. Scientists thought ""it was just another Martian mesa"" but they also noted one unusual shadow, so they were not that clear on the reason. In 1998 NASA took another picture in better resolution but it was cloudy and some people were not convinced that it was a mesa. In 2001 NASA was finally able to capture a clear picture of the formation, putting down any kind of conspiracy theories.

Speaking of conspiracy theories, many believed that ""...the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars"". Some theories were that aliens built ""an Egyptian pharoah"". Some of the scientists at NASA even believed that it was evidence of alien life on mars! Conspiracy theorists say that NASA would rather hide life on Mars, but defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilisation on mars becuase then NASA would get more money to go to mars.

Now with higher resolution pictures NASA scientists have found what the ""Face"" really is. It seems that their earlier guesses were in fact correct! As quoted in ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"". The scientists were correct on saying it looked like a mesa. They have even found out with higher resolution pictures that it almost resembles the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. They both have a similar height and shape.

Sadly the ""Face"" is not an ancient alien ruins or a temple. Dont we all want it to be proof of life on mars? Scientists have proved that it is not though. Scientists say that it is in fact a mesa, and they put to rest a long standing mystery of the face on mars and any conspiracy theories with it.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
1D023C6D201A,"It could not be made by aliens because Mars can make land forms such as a face or something. If you look at these three images you will notice over the years we have been able to unblur this image and it shows there is no face on Mars.

We have snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reaveling. . .a natrual landform.

As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they were.

What the picture actual shows is the Matrian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.

E4CE3E508B44,"The ""Face on Mars"" is really not a a face at all. In fact, it is simply a landform. There is no alien remains or anything like that. It sure does look like a face, but that was merely a coinsidence.

There are many ways to prove this statement. Today, I will only cover a few, though. They are very good points. By the end of this, I think you'll be agreeing with me also.

First of all, to prove this is a landform and not aliens is, there is only a face, no body. If this really was aliens there would be a body to go along with this face. From the picture provided in the article, I can clearly see that there is a face and a fce only. Absolutely no body found. In fact, there is not even a bump or anything proving this has no body and aliens would most likely have a body if they have a head/face.

The second reason as to why this cannot be an alien is, if it was an alien NASA would have found more than one by now. This landform was first discovered in 1976. That is a long time ago. If this truely was an alien that once had life, there would most definetly be more than one. But, there is not. There is only one. This is another reason proving this is not aliens, but just a landform.

The third an final reason why this is nothing more than a landform, not aliens, in it would have been identified by now. NASA would have came out and said it already. There is no way we can actually prove that is actually an alien. But, we have classified it as a landform. We even have other landforms on earth to compre it too. Many say it is equivalent to a butte or mesa(many things found in the American Mest). ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" Garvin says.

In conclusion, this is not aliens. This is simply a landform. Even though it does look like a face we have supporting details that back up our argument. It is clearly not an alien. Everything needed to prove this is tight in this essay. I hope that now you have come to your senses and agree with me. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
885D400914AE,"It was not aliens! ""The Face on Mars"" was not made by aliens. It is a natural landform. It is a Martian messa. The messa was revealed to the public as an attraction to gain peoples interset in Mars not to assure proof of aliens. It could not have been created by aliens because it is a natural landform like any other massive landforms on Earth. Also it was revealed to the public to be an attraction.

The messa: ""The Face on Mars"" was discovered in 1976 by a voyager named Viking. The messa was revealed to the public a few days later. The authors reasoned it would draw attention to Mars. The reasoning for revealing the messa proves it was not created by aliens it is a natural landform. Things like the Appilation Mountains were not created but are natural landforms. the same thing goes for ""The Face on Mars,"" it wasnt created by aliens but is a natural landform.

The Mars face is actually a messa which are common sight in the American West. So this is strong proof that it is actually just a natural landform. If there was something out there like aleins which would have been proven to be real by now we would have proof of there existince then that could be another explanation but since we have no proof that they exist then we quikley ruled out that as a option

We knew as soon as the pictures where released that the critics and media would go go crazy on Nasa.

Evidence from the text shows that when NASA first seen this picture that they thought nothing of it for the simple fact that it has been seen in areas in West America thats natural and so they thought it was a Martain mesa. This is making them believe that is was just another Martain mesa.

B913965F729B,First off I don't think there are a such thing as aliens so i don't think that would be the case. Im here to tell you guys and ladies that this is a natural landform built from rocks piled up and all around each other. If you think the aliens did it how could they have done it if it's sticking outside the ground instead of inside. As you see in the pictures when the years go by the cameras and pictures get better asthe face structure starts to disappear and it makes it look like a bunch of rocks. They don't know if they actually seen a face they said it was winter on that side when this picture was tooken. So there were clouds and just a lot of stuff covering the cameras when they took the picture. This is a natural landform from rocks and other stuff but i would see why you would think that. It is kind of weird to see other things like this on other planets that don't even have human life or something close to it for this to happen.

0ABF7A12CCF2,"Is the Face on Mars a mesa or is it made by alien life? Well, the answer to that world-wide question is that it is a mesa. In other words, a natural landform that has been there or been made over time by the planets rotation. I strongly believe that the Face on planet Mars is just a natural landform, because we have almost like it on Earth, there are no signs of alien life in the pictures or scientific research, and the pictures taken, show that there are shadows that create a facial look in the natural landform.

First off, we have a natural landform located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The one on Mars is almost equivalent to the one here on our planet. In paragraph 12, it states, "" That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This is plainly saying that the one on planet Mars could just be a lava dome of some sort just like the one here on Earth.

Also, there are no signs of alien life through the pictures taken from the cameras. How could this alien life we talk about create this Face, when there is no evidence of this alien life? The pictures were taken mutiple times in different years to make sure of this. They had people questioning, so they did further research. For example in paragraph number eight, ""...peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by daze."" The skeptics that wanted the benifits of actually finding alien life wanted actual proof that it is merily only a mesa. They ende up being proved that it is only a mesa.

To also say, the photographs that were studied have been intereprted. They have been interepreted to the point that they can pin-point certain material. They proved that by when they said that is merily shadows that the mesa has, from depth, that create the face like look. For example in paragraph number three, it states ""The captain noted a 'huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'"" The images were showing that there were some dips in this mesa that created it to look as if it were an actual face.

There are people who say,"" Just because the cameras say that there is no life on Mars, doesn't mean that there is no life."" To prove that wrong, it states in paragraph number 11, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" Also later on in the paragraph, ""...if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian pyramids... you could see what they were."" Meaning if there was any 3-d image, it would have been picked up and been able to ananlyze. The Face is obviously a natural landform that has been there from the beginnging. Also, people used to say and still say "" look at the man on the moon."" There is no man on the moon, there is a mesa that was shaped that looks like a Face. The Face n Mars is just another incident of what happend with the moon.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a natural landform like the one here on earth and the one that appears on the face of the moon. I strongly hold my belief that the Face on planet Mars is just a natural landform because there is almost an exact replica here on earth, there are no sientific signs of life, and the pictures that were taken, that have been analized, show that shadows create the face. Will there one day be life somewhere else besides Earth. I will never know, but as of right now and the scientific records that are based on this essay, this Face that people say might be made by aliens is not logical. This Face on Mars is a mesa. Once you can find scientific data that proves there is life on earth, than everything said for years ca be proven wrong. But as of right now, no.",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
E7DD5E2523B7,"There are many controversial ideas about what was seen in the picture on Cydonia. Some belive it was from alien life form some do not. I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens. I say this because we have pictures proving so, landforms are known to form in odd ways, and we have double checked and there were no signs of alien life forms.

The ""Face"" was not created by aliens because we have pictures proving so. In the article ""Unmasking The Face Of Mars"" they said that when they first saw a picture of this mysterious face is was the year 1976. A lot of changes were being made that year, it was the peak of technology for Americans and we were bound to go on in our experiments. it states in the article that "" And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original vikings photo."" And in return it was a natural landform. But people were still not satisfied. They claimed that the picture was taken at a cloudy time of year for the Red Planet so they tried again as stated in the passage, "" Nevertheless on April 8, 2001 a cloudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"" and the results were as followed, "" Marlins team captured an extroardinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution"" the results still came back as a lanform.

I do not believe that the "" Face "" was created by aliens because landfroms are known to form in odd ways. For example in the article it states that "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the american west."" They claimed this after taking the picture April 8, 2001. The picture simply shows ""a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose,and mouth."" as said in the article. How many times when we were all children did we think we saw someone when it was just a shadow? plenty of times and in this instance it is exactly the same.

And lastly I do not believe that the ""Face"" on Mars was created by alien life form because we have double checked and checked again and we did not find signs of any form of life on Mars. It said in the article that they took a picture in 1976, then they were astonished so they checked again in 1998, and then when people were still not satisfied they checked agin in 2001. It sates in the article that ""Each pixel in 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo""

and not only that but, "" As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" this goes to show that there were no life forms ever there and that the face is simply landforms and shadows and that aliens did not have anything to do with this sittuation at all.

However though, it states in the article that "" The face of Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines,radio talk shows- even haunted grocery store checkou tlines for 25 years! some people think that the face is a bona fide evidence of life on mars"" It is not uncommon or odd that peopkle would want to belive that there is another life forms besides what we already know, some would go as far to say that "" evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" as stated in the article. But the most shocking thing is when it says that "" defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" I don't see why anybody working with NASA would ever doubt the system if they are a aprt of it, but then again NASA most likely does not just give out important information to everybody who steps foot into there office claiming to work there. And it wouldn't surprise me actually if the budget defenders of NASA did wish that there was actualy life forms because NASA is having to dump more and more money because people like the ""conspiracy theorists"" can't just have faith and believe what NASA tells them even though they had evidence to back them up.

To all of this is still say that I do not believe that the ""Face"" was created by aliens . I say this because we have pictures and images proving so, landforms are know to grow in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and because we have double checked and checked and there were no signs of alien life or any form of life at all up on Mars.

43F478AC2220,"The disputes about the Face being an alien creation rather than a landform are preposterous. Alien life is a common conspirasy theory, but this one proves just that: a theory. The Face cannot possibly be an alien creation because there is no evidence of alien life ever existing, the landform it is compared to on Earth was certainly not created by aliens, and scientists have extensively studied it to prove that it is, indeed, a natural landform.

For starters, in order for the aliens to create this two-mile long ""face"", dimensioned straight from NASA, they must first exist. Unfortunately for the pro-alien believers, this has never been proven. Some say that NASA is keeping this monumental secret from us, but, as thoughtfully pointed out in the article, the existance of ancient alien life would benefit them immensely. In this case, there is no reason for them to hide anything.

Another thing worth mentioning is the strong resemblance to the landforms found right here in the United States. These mesas are common in the American West, says chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program. There is no reason that they can't be common on the Red Planet, either. The article states that in Cydonia, the region where the Face is located is actually known to have mesas scattered frequently around the area. Unless Earth's mesas, too, were crafted by aliens, they both must be natural landforms.

The Face has been a topic of conversation since it was first photographed in 1976. When NASA first released the picture to the public, the caption stated: ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" Then, after extensive research to prove that it was actually not an alien creation of sorts, NASA determined that the shadows were, indeed, the cause of the shapes of the Face. It was even photographed numerous times to prove this fact, and because they felt it was important to taxpayers, as the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program noted.

Skeptics of the Face might say that it is all a well thought out trick to hide alien life ffrom the general public. However, as previously mentioned, NASA would benefit if this ancient civilization was real. Therefore, there is no logical reason they would keep this from us. The article states that when the very first picture of the Face was released: ""the authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" This shows us that they are wanting people to be interested, which would be much easier if there was an alien or two to report, but there is clearly not.

The landform labeled the Face is certainly an intriguing discovery, but not for the fact it was an acient alien monument. It is interesting because it connects us with the Red Planet considering we have landforms similar to it, and also the expert study that has gone into it to prove the suspicions incorrect.

2037D9236C4C,"There has been a large argument about the ""Face on Mars"". This ""Face on Mars"" is located in a region called Cydonia, where martian mesas are commmon. It has gain a lot of attention from conspiracy theorist that belive there is life on Mars, and they belive an alien life form has created the face. While scientist are positive, that this is a natural landform like you see on Earth. However, conspiracy theorists ignore what the scientists say.

If aliens had created a monument that looked like humans, how would they know what we look like in the first place? We have not seen or proven that there is life on Mars, and if they knew what we looked like, wouldn't we know what they look like? Many conpsiracy theriosts argue that NASA wants to keep aliens a secret, but NASA would love to find an ancient civilization on Mars. If they could find an ancient civilization that could be a break through in science and biology.

When they took another picture in April 1998, the picture was taken with clouds in the sky, making it impossible to see the small things. The theriosts argue that they couldn't see anything, so on April 8, 2001 they took another picture. It was a cloudless day in the Cydonia region. They took aother picture of the phenomeun in full resolution, and that picture proves that the face is just a mesa or butte. The landform was even common in the United States.

Many conspiracy theorists was wishing for this to be a momunment from an anicent civilization, but the facts are agaist it. In the high resolution picture you can see the crevices in the land that make up the lanform. With the ditches and holes in the land, it causes shadows that reemble the eyes, nose, and mouth of a human. NASA would be happy to find an ancient civilization on Mars, but they look to the information first.    ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
13E8A2F76C57,"Do you think theres a real alien artifact on mars? Well if you do, im sorry but there isn't. Even thoe ""the Face on Mars"" may look like an alien artifact, is just a natural land form. There are many of these in Cydonia and they're called Martian mesas. This Martian messa looks as if it's a face because of its unusual shadows that creat the illusion of eyes, a nose and a mouth.

In April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michale Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture, that is 10 times sharper than the orignal one tooken by Viking 1, of the face on mars. This picture finally revield that there was no face on mars, but a natural landform.

This didn't satisfi many people. They thought the alien markings where hidden by a haze, since that was the time of year where that part of mars gets clody. So on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor took a final look. Then, when they finally found it Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

What this thing actually is is "" the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" which are landforms common around the American West. This was simply a chance for NASA to get a little money.                                      ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
4434757F78FB,"The Face on Mars has been a pop icon for years. Many people believe that the Face on Mars is made by aliens. The Face on Mars is a natural landform and was not created by aliens. The evidence that proves this is true is there is another landform just like it on Earth and there are detailed pictures that show it is just a natural landform.

The first evidence that shows it is just a landform is the fact that there is another natural landform like that on Earth. The picture shows an equivalent to a butte or messa, which is a landform that is common around the American West. The text says, ""'It reminds me of the most Middle Butte in the Snake Plain of Idaho,'...about the same height as the Face on Mars.'""

This quote is giving a clear example of someone saying that the Face is like a natural landform on Earth. If it is like something that is made on Earth naturally, that means it could probably made naturally on Mars too. There is another great piece of evidence showing that it is a natrual landform.

Another piece of evidence that proves the Face is a natural landform is that there are detailed pictures that show it is all natural. In 2001 NASA could take pictures with each pixel thats spans 1.56 metes, which is very detailed for the technology we have. The text says, ""'Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.'"" This example goes to show that NASA took a picture using the best resolution they had on their cameras to show and see the fact that it is not alien made and is all naturally made.

Many people believe the Face on Mars is made by aliens but that is not true at all. The Face is just a natural landform. The evidence that goes to prove it is the fact that there is another landform just like it on Earth and there are detailed pictures that show it is just a natural landform.

B75F6B21DD30,"Imagine going to outer space, and you land on Mars. When you get there you find a landform that you haven't seen before. This could be something big, but you know it isn't alive, so you have to assume it is a landform. When you go back and show everyone what you found people think it is an alien, but further investigations show it is a natural landform. This Face is a natural landform because no one has ever seen something like this before, no one has any proof that it is a human or alien, and NASA and the Mars Global Surveyor say it is a landform.

First of all, no one has seen anything like this before. The text states,"" There must have been a degree of surprise among mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors."" This peice of evidence shows that the face is new to them, and they don't know what it is. Another piece of evidence is,"" Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars."" This, also, shows that NASA doesn't know what it is. If no one knows what it is then you can't say it is a human or alien without knowing the facts.

Secondly, no one has any proof that it could be an alien or a human. For instance, the text states,"" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa."" This piece of evidence shows that they can't figure out exactly what the face is. They are making aussumtions of what the face might be, but they aren't one-hundred percent sure of what it is. NASA would have to have proof to say it is an alien or not.

Lastly, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet he found out the face was a natural landform. For example, the text states,"" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform."" This shows that once they got a clear picture of the face, the JPL found out it was just an ordinary landform. The text also states,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" This piece of evidence found in the text shows that NASA figured out that the face was a landform. Yes, the face did look like a human, but the NASA found out it was a landform when they closely examined the it.

In conclusion, the face that was thought to be an alien or a human was clearly a natural landform. First of all, it was never seen before, so no one could be sure of what it was. Secondly, people just assumed it was an alien or a human, and they had no proof that it was. Lastly, the Mars Global Surveyor found out the face was a natural landform. This evidence shows that face everyone thought was an alien was actually a natural landform.       ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
15FD0BE074DC,"Was the Face on Mars created by aliens?

Do you think the face on Mars was created by aliens? I don't... and that's because it's to many reasons that prove it's not. I'm a scientist at NASA and I helped prove these reasons. We found that it is just a butte or a mesa, aliens are not even real, and there is no life on Mars.

It has been proven that it is just a butte or a mesa, this is what the picture actually shows....landforms. A friend my mine, Garvin says that is reminds him of ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" that's here on Earth. So that states that we have the resources to prove it is a mesa!

It has been proven aliens are not even real. I mean people ""say"" they have seen one and even took pictures of them, but that doesn't mean they are real. We have not yet seen or even captured one for testing yet which proves that they are not real. This person who tells me that they ""think"" aliens created this face doen't even know if it's true. Therefore this is just a thought that is not true.

On another note there is no life on Mars, as proven by us (NASA). We have tested for air and a way we could live there without holding a oxegen tank around and there is no way. People think we are hiding if there is any life on Mars and if the face was created by aliens, but why would we let the World know that we were even researching about life on Mars or that we even found a face on Mars if we didn't want the World to know? Yes, we've done research over and over again to prove to the World that there is no life on Mars and that the face is just a mesa, so we ask that the World believes us and keep the peace.

9F412706B120,"Is there a face is on Mars? I would say no, the face on Mars is not an alien artifact. There are shadows that can make it seem like a face ,but shadows can alter thing appearnces. April 5th, 1998, and April 8th 2001 have clearer images that can prove that prove that it is also not alien. Unlike the photos of the Viking 1 in 1976 ,which were older and were less clear. So the Face is not real because of, the later more clearer images prove that it is not, and shadows can alter one's apperance.

First off, the Face on the isn't a face it is a rock on Mars, that had shaows that made it look like face. People and imgaes can come about blurry ,and may looklike something else. Also pixels also can help make things seem like they are not what the they are. Like the picture in April 8th, 2001 pixels made it look clearer. A compasrion can be shared of the 1976 picture to the 2001 picture, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo""(10). There is comparaion toeach photo that was taken and as time went on it got clearer and showed less of a face. Which makes it more of reason it is not an ailean artifact.

Next, on April 5th ,1998 after the 1976 Viking picture of the face on Mars became a hit. NASA wanted to go take another picture ,because people keppsying it was made by aliens,it was difficult though. After NASA had gotten the photo though,it was more clear, which again proves that it is not an alien artifact. Even in the passage it states about it ,""Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture tne times sharper than the origianl Viking photos""(7). After that it was on the web people realized that it is a land form not a alien structure. So it is a fact that it is not an alien artifact.

Finally, On april 8th ,2001, people still were blieving that alien made the landform. So NASA snapped another picture, in the passage it states ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view""(10). This mean they had gotten a good angle on the Face. And the picture was more clearer again. They had proven to the world that the Face was not alien. It was a landform.

My oppionent might state to me though that we did not see the real deal on screen just with a picture. They could of had edited it to make not alien. That is true but in 2001 they didn't have good editing system unlike we do today. So that image can not be really edited.

In conclusion, the Face is not alien the images of April 8th, 2001 and April 5th, 1998 can prove this. Also there are not editing system theat were really good to photo shop back then, and it had been proven many times by NASA that it is not.   ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
1676DF45EDFF,"yes this may seem like the aliens did it so it can think its no real , but you have to look at the facts around it. This was taken 25 years ago.

The face of mars is a pixel image .It is a exact degree angle span.

Aliens wouldnt be able to do that , it can also be a different object other then a face.

this also can be many different things other then a face. It states "".. but the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusua shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA unveiled the the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation.""...""so if there were objects in this picutre like airlanes on the ground or Egyptains-style pyraids or even small shacks , you could see what they were !"". This shows the imaghe can reveal anything. Aliens coukd not make anything if they knew what they were gong to make .But scince can also prive that .

Scince equitament how the image can really come off as. For example ""...which resembles a human head .. formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes , nose and mouth.

Have you ever thought of being a scientist at NASA or have you ever seen the Face on Mars? Well I am a scientist and I have been very lucky to go to space and see the Face in person. It was one of the best experiences that has ever happened to me in life! Some people think that the Face was created by aliens even though there has been many tests and agreements that it is just a natural landform. I belive that it is a natural landform beacuse there is proof that scientists have figured it was just another Martian mesa, there are pictures that proves it could just be formed like that because it is common around Cydonia, and there has not yet been any proof to encourage it was created by aliens.

The scientists and I have done several researches ever since we first saw the Face. Everything has yet led to prooving it is just another Martian mesa. Looking through all the pictures, everything stated that it is just a huge rock formation. The rock resembles a human head with eyes, a mouth, and a nose. I believe that after all the temperatures such as the heat and coldness, it could have caused it to be shaped like that. There has probably even been spaceships that has landed in Mars in search of investigation. The spaceships could have formed these shapes when landing there.

As you probably know, it is very common around Cydonia to have these kind of natural landfoms. Yes, it is common to have shapes and forms that are unusual such as the Face. The only difference in this one was that it had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Theres not really much of a difference if you think about it. It is unbelievable that it's the first time poeple think of an alien doing this art work when they have never thought of this idea when we have found other evidence of natural lanforms like the Face.

There has been plenty of evidence to proove that the Face is just a natural landform, but there is no proove of it to be created by aliens. Looking at the pictures closely, there are no footprints, fingerprints, or marks to show any living life in Mars. If theres no living life in Mars, then how could there be aliens? I want you to think about that. There has not been any kind of creatures found in Mars which is shocking.

Now that I have explained myself of why I believe that the Face is just a natural landform, what do you think? Do you still believe aliens created it?

496EB21D745B,"If I were a scientist at NASA I will not believed alien because most of scientists said aliens are not real and I think they just made up of alien. A face on Mars is maybe when the wind blow the dust it trun that face or when they goes there they died and their dead body face is still there. But it's really interesting because that face is really big and it image 3 times bigger than th epixel size. But I believed there are not alien in the other planets or in earth because alien are not real but I have to makesure that I have to ask more question to the smartest scientist and ask about how did that face happen and how are we gonna prove about that. I have to ask more question about that too and they said that face look like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyrmaids or even small shacks, you could see what they were. Some of them don't believe it because they don't see it and they just guess that answer. But when I looked at the picture I think I saw that crown and their face look shiney and in 2001 that face look destroy . I don't believe in aliens but if there was some aliens in that planet they might made that face too and they hid away from that face. I wish I see that picture for real and take some picture and prove it.",1,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
0F828F5772D6,"Gerald was one of the scientists that led the investigation on the Face. He had been to college already, so he has been very experienced with these types of scenarios. He used NASA's Viking 1, and saw an object that appeared to be a face. He got a closer look later in his career, and it was not an actual face. This was later taken by surprise by the general public, and they still thought that it had to be a real sign of life on Mars. Because of this research, I believe that the face is just a natural landform. Three reasons why I believe this is true are that NASA's research has proven this, photographs taken by NASA have shown that this is true, and comparisons to landforms on Earth have shown the public that this is the truth.

My first reason for stating my opinion would be that NASA's research has proven that the Face is a landform. An example of this from the text would be that NASA has published many photos of the Face to show the public that it was just a landform. To further explain this, if you look close enough at the pictures in this passage, then you can see it is a landform. It may look like a face from a far distance, but evidence given by NASA has shown that this is not the case.

My second reason for this is the fact that NASA has taken many photographs of this landform to prove it is true. Here is a quote from the text that shows this: ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" Later in this paragraph, it states that the picture has proven that there was not an alien monument. Secondly, as people stated, it was a cloudy day in Mars, so they were not satisfied with the picture. So, ""On April 8, 2001-a cloudless summer day in Cydonia-Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. Later in the paragraph, Garvin, an expert that works with NASA, says this: ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Even though it wasn't cloudy, the team of NASA got the same result: it is just a landform.

My last reason would be that comparisons to landforms on Earth have proven that this is true. Garvin says in paragraph twelve that ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" What this is saying is that there have been similar landforms on Earth that are on Mars. Scientists can use this data to compare different pieces of landforms on different planets. Using this, they can figure out what the Face actually is, and other mysteries that they come up against.

Some people may have used to say that the picture was too blurry to make out what the Face actually was. However, NASA has taken many clear photos of the Face, and they have proven several times that it is not an alien artifact, and that it is only a landform on the surface of the planet.

So, what do you think now? Do you still believe that the Face is an ancient artifact? Well, you should not anymore after reading this; the evidence given here in this essay clearly shows that the Face is just a landform. Scientists like Gerald and Garvin have shown this a repeated amount of times. So, in conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform, and not proof of life on Mars.",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
DA44340727CE,"Today I was having an agument with my buddy. This argument was about ""The Face on Mars"". We both had our own opinions on what we thought it was. We weere sitting in my living room on the tan couch with the television on. My friend was tall with blonde hair and skinny. I had brown hair and was average height. I worked for Nasa so I had seen pictures of what it was and had proof that it was only a mesa and it was an illusion to the human eye.

Zeke thought it was an artifact on once living life on Mars. He thought Nasa was going to say it was something else so people wouldn't truly know what it was. He thought Nasa was trying to keep it in the dark so noone would try and travel there to get closer looks on it and steal there idea. Zeke thought we needed to run further studies to truely figure out what this was.

I told Zeke that it was only a landform on Mars and not some alien artifact. I told him that it was a mesa which was common in this area of Mars. I also explained how shadows made it look like a face and how it was all an illusion that was visible to the human eye. They said that this landform was nothing more than a landorm on Mars that wasnt what it had appered to be.

Zeke, who was a man of what he said, did not believe me and wouldn't take my word for it. Once he got an idea in his head it wasn't going to move for anything. It did not matter what proof you showed him he wouldn't believe as single word. He argued with me about if or hours until finally we decided that we wouldn't argue about it anymore. He still told me he thought his idea was right and I was completly wrong.

I told Zeke i worked for Nasa so I would know way more than he does an I insured him it was not an alien artifact and it was just a mesa which looked to be something it wasn't and that he shouldn't be so stubborn about it and just believe me. Knowing Zeke I didn't thnk he would even budge. Of course i was right and Zeke didn't sway his answer at all.

I offered to show him prove. I had pictures of the event and so I showed him. He finally could see what we saw. He decided that he needed to look closer into the pictures. He came back the next morining and we sat down and ate donuts and drank some coffe. He gave me back the pictures and he said ""You know I think those pictures didn't help change my mind at all""   ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
EF6387E221CC,"Its Just A Landform

NASA recently has just seen a human looking face on Mars, NASA has an image of the ""Face"" and they have released it for public view. People have questioned ""Was it created by aliens?"" So many people believe that it was indeed created by aliens. I believe that it is just a natural landform and it just so happened to look like a human face, for these many reasons.

In the article ""Unmasking Face on Mars"" it states that many people believe that this is not just a landform, it is some kind of alien creation. But, i can tell you otherwise. In stanza 3 it says, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head..formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" It clearly says,""formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" That can give you an image of how the shadows could have formed this face like creation.

Another reason for this not being an alien cretaion as it states in stanza 7 of this article,""thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reavling...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""This is a great reason for people to realize that it is not an alien creation. After a team captured another photo but ten times sharper, than the original Viking photos, they finally saw that it was nothing more than a natural landform and it must've been shadows that created such human like looks, as I already stated and also as stated in the article.

Although, people will still think it was an alien creation and NASA is keeping it away from the public, we are highly not. There has been no sight of any alien activity what so ever. The ""Face"" is not a start of alien activity and probably never will be.

In conlusion, this so called ""alien creation"" is not an alien creation. I know and believe it is not an alien creation, due to those reasons that I have named above. This human face looking creation is only and nothing more a natural landform. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
2BC448B88B54,"In the year 1976, when Viking 1 space craft was taking photographs of possiable landing spots for Viking 2 spacecraft, they found a formation in a rock that looked like a human face. The shadows made the rock look like it had a nose, mouth, and two eyes, like a human. This was found in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The ""Head"" was nearly two miles from end to end, and it seemed to be starring back at the cameras.

The controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab were probably quite surprised when this face popped up on their screens, looking them right in the eyes. This sensation was short lived. Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, which was common around Cydonia. The only difference with this one is it had unusal shadows that made it seem like an Egyptian Pharaoh. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for the public eye to see. The caption on this picture was ""Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose and a mouth."" NASA'S reasoning was that the picture would help engage public attraction to Mars.

This public picture was soon a pop icon. It starred in Hollywood films, was in books, magazines, talk shows on the radio, and even haunted grogery store checkout lines for over 25 years. Some people think that this picture is evidence of life on Mars. Conspiracy theorist say that this is information NASA would rather hide. Defenders of the NASA budget wish that there was life on Mars, as this would make NASA more popular, and even richer, when people use the picture in books, movies, magazines, and more.

Although most scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority to NASA, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist, said that they felt like it was a right of taxpayers to see photographs of the face as soon as possiable. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin snapped a photograph ten times sharper then the old one. This became popular with web surfers, as they were waiting for the first photo to show up on a JPL website. Only this picture showed what they were not wanting, a natural landform. This was not an alien momument after all.

While most people were satisfied, others were not. They still think that NASA is still hiding evidence of an alien momument. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. The camera on board MGS had to peer though whispy clouds to see it. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden behind clouds on purpose, so that humans would not be able to see them. Mission controls planned to take another photograph of it. It is not easy work, and it is not easy to target Cydonia. They just do not pass the face very often.

Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, MGS drew close enough for a second veiw. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view.

They used the cameras highest resolution. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans at 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Vikings photo.""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were objects on the ground such as airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were"" Said Jim Garvin.

What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms that are common around the American West.

C7F3D57F1D29,"Unmasking the face on mars is a cool story, but if i was a scientist at NASA discussing the face with someone who thinks it was created by aliens i would tell them its not created by aliens its just a natural landform thats is on mars.

Im not just saying this to say it but what i figured out is that eighteen long years ago after the viking missions ended. That the face that they found was important to the taxpayers. I also found out that the face on mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude were it was winter in april, a cloudy time of year on the red planet.

so my argumentative essay to the people that believe it was created by aliens well its not because when michael malin and his mars arbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original viking photos, thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, releaving a natural landform there were no aliens monument after all.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
D0D5701BFEE5,"The face on Mars is often a very controversial subject. People often think that NASA is hiding something about it from the entire world,and that is alien life. The idea that this is a real alien landform has been proven wrong and wrong again, so why do people still gravitate toward it?

The poor quality cameras back in 1976 are nothing compared to the ones in 2001. There are photos of the landform from 2001 that make it look nothing like a face. The most recent photos have been taken on a cloud less day, with the resolution up as far as it would go. This means that the photo was as sharp as it possibly could be. If there were any small structers next to the landform, you could also see those.

There is a preconcieved notion that NASA is hiding the discovery that the face is alien made. Why would NASA want to hide it though? If there was alien life on Mars, NASA could gain a lot of money from the publicity. Think about it, NASA could gain so much from proving that that land form is ,in fact, alien made.

In conclusion,the fact that the famous face on mars is an alien made landform, has been almost completely busted. There are too many things going against it. With the better quality cameras, and the fact that NASA would actually get money if it was alien made, has proven this conspiracy theory wrong.

It became popular after the scientists and researchers found out about it. It went on tv shows, movies, magazines, and stuff like that.

Some scientist think that it was some kind of alien artifact, even though aliens do not exist. Some of the scientists or the Mars Orbiter Camera took a lot of pictures to get a really good picture of it. The scientists did this because they wanted to be able to study a lot better and they would get a better view of the face, if they get a really good picture of it. It took a while for them to get the picture on this JPL web site. It turns out that the face was not an alien's artifact after all.

The scientists wanted to get another picture of the face on Mars. They wanted to have a second look at it, to make sure that can get the right information on it. Like where the face is, what degrees it is at, which it is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude. They wanted to find good information about it. They wanted to get better pictures of it so they could study it more, so they could get research on it.

Some people think that the face on Mars looks equivalent to a butte or mesa, which is a landform commom around the American West. So now people know what it looks like. Some people might think it still looks like a face to them but other people might not think that anymore. They think it looks different now that the scientists figured out what it looks like. The scientists figured out that the lava dome, isolated the form mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

The scientists might still be trying to figure out how this face appeared on Mars how it got there. Some people are trying to figure out what the face looks like, even some people think that the face on Mars doesn't even look like a face. Scientists might look at this differently now. They might as well keep trying to figure it out if they want to.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The face of on the stone may possibly be weather created by its own planet. In the artical it states, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa."" Which this means the face looked like landforms juist like on earth, that are found in the American west.

In paragraph 11 a man states about the ""rule of the thumb"" which tells us about how you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. this explains to us that if the face was real there shouldve been other things to see around it.

Lastly in paragraph 7 the artical says in April 1998, they sent Cydonia over to mars too take pictures and there was no cloudy weather it was perfectly fine, and it took photos of the face. People at home were waiting for the picture to be released, just to find that it was a natural landform.

People can beleive that this is a real face however, they are wrong becauase that the pictue that was taken by cydonia looks just like a normal, natural landform and also the image they had, if they would've zoomed in on it 3 times they should've seen oher things. They also say that the face just looks like a mesa just like in the west of America.

D7A1CEA5C3FA,"The Face on Mars is not made by aliens. There is no proof whatsoever of any signs of life on Mars, which means no aliens. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that coincidently looks like a human face. Given the shadows and shape, the Face very much looks like it has a human nose mouth, and eyes. Although up close, there is no resemblence of a human face. Therefore, do not let this anyone fool you.

Pictures have been taken by NASA of the Face to prove it is just a natural landform. Pictures taken from 1976 appear blurry, and not clear, so it is easy to believe that aliens created the Face. Although, in 1998, the pictures taken aren't as blurry, and you can see the structure of the landfrom clearly. Lastly, the picture taken in 2001 is clear and visible. You can perfectly see that close up, the Face is just another natural landform on Mars. From far away, it looks like a human face because of the shadows, but up close, it is nothing more than a simple landform.

Furthermore, on 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor went back to looks for the Face again. When they snapped a photo of it, it was indeed ""ten times sharper than the photo taken in 1976."" This revealed that it was just a natural landform when the photo appeared online. ""There was no alien monument after all.""

Some people who still believe that the Face was created by aliens say that ""alien markings were hidden by haze"", but the Face was only hidden because it was winter when the photo was taken. Since it was winter in April 1998, it was also the ""cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" Therefore, the camera used had to ""peer through wispy clouds to see the Face."" This proves that aliens markings are not hidden by haze; it's the time of year where it is cloudy on Mars, making it harder to see the Face.

Plus, when NASA took another picture in 2001, it was taken using the ""camera's absolute maximum solution."" Based on what I read, ""each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" There simply can't be anything you can miss using the camera's absolute maximum solution. Jim Garvin, cheif scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, even said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could what they where!""

Finally, NASA's explanation about the Face on Mars is based on credible information and research. People who believe aliens created the Face often get the information inside their head, making up crazy theories that aren't actually true. Furthermore, NASA went on missions to prove that the Face isn't made by aliens. They took high-quality photos that show that it is just a natural landscape. Besides making things up on their own, skeptics probably take information from the internet on websites that other skeptics have made about aliens creating the Face. You can never trust the internet, and the skeptics who made these websites probably put down their own made up facts and theories to get people to join their side.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not created by aliens. It is just extraordinarily shaped to look like a human head, with shadows to create the illusion that it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth from far away. Up close, there is not resemblence of a human face at all. Pictures, missions, and years of research have proved it. Plus, there were no signs of aliens, or any life on Mars when they conducted this research. The Face on Mars is just a natural landform.",6,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

D7B6E927B1A0,"""The Face"" Is Not A Face

The 1998 dicovery of, the Face has gotten its fair share of publicity throughout numerous years. This photo that was taken on NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft, as it was searching for possible landing sites. This ""face"" is nothing but a natural landfrom that happens to look like a face. There are many persuasive and factual reasons to back up the fact that there has been no alien formation on Mars.

First, there has been no real, hard evidence that this human-like figure is actually a face. The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" even says,""it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face."" (Notice, it said likeness.) Just because one article and a Hollywood movie says that this was alien created, doesn't mean it really was.

Also, any natural landforms can look like something it is not. Have you ever looked at a rock or even a cloud and said, ""Wow, that looks like a [insert object or name]!"" There have been plenty of instances in which something has been mistaken to be someting it is not. For example, The Little Dipper, as we call it, is said to look like a spoon. Does that mean that there is a big, shiny spoon in the sky? Of couse not, so why should we say the same about a formation of rocks on Mars that happen to look like a face.

Lastly, NASA has even confirmed that this is just a natural rock formation. I know this because, NASA unveiled an image of this ""face"" and captioned it, ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusions of eyes, nose, and mouth."" So, this rock's shadows have given the illusion of a human-like face, which leads to the assumption that there is no real face.

You might be thinking,"" Well, why did the people who discovered this even release the information if it wasn't comepletely factual."" This is beacuse of the conspiracy theorists. Think about it , if you would have never heard about this Face on Earth in books, magazines, and radio talk shows, would you have believed it? NASA is a very trustworthy and credible association and if information wasn't released until it was proven true than none of this would have happened.

In conlusion, the Face on Earth is nothing but a myth, until there are reliable discoveries that have declared it real. Since there is no evidence that there has been alien formation on Earth, it is just a hoax. I hope I have given a sufficent amount of reasons to argue that the Face is not a face.

There are ablolutly zero facts that aliens would be able to make a face. Or that there are aliens. No facts. No aliens. If there were aliens how would they even make a face?

CA52F66EBA01,"Recently we have discovered a new landform on Mars. Viking 1 caught a picture of a martian mesa, these are very common. These martian mesas are similar to the ones on Earth. They are very common in Cydonia, a region on Mars. Many conspiracy therorists are saying that it was constructed by aliens, but from the evidence we have, this is not true.

The picture taken by Viking 1 showed a large mesa-like landform with the face an Egyptian god on it. Everything can be explained in the picture. The landform is like any other one. The reason it looks like a face is because shadows were being cast onto it to make it appear like it had eyes, a mouth and a nose.

In 1998, a camera captured another picture of the formation. It was a little cloudy on the day they took the picture, so we went again to capture another picture. This time in April of 2001, we used a much better camera and used maximum resolution. This picture was much more detailed and clear. Once we zoomed in it looked like any other landform we might find. In paragraph 11 Garvin states, ¨So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks you could see them!¨ He was correct this picture proves that there is no alien activity near this landoform.

In conclusion, it is clear that the ¨Face on Mars¨ wasn´t created by aliens. We took a much more defined picture and found nothing.

The face is not that big of a deal. The face is a way for organizations to sell their products. As it says in the fifth paragraph, ""The 'face on mars' has become a pop icon.

""The face is bona fide evidence on mars"". But we also know that sand storms are very common on Mars, how could it not just be one of those that did it?

Rock formations like the face are common in that area of mars and it is very possible that they could look like a face. There are a lot of rock formations on Mars. Out of all those formations, one of them is probably going to resemble a face.

Forty years later, those consperacies remain in the minds of many people who do not belive NASA when they say, ""It's just a mesa."" NASA has sent three objects to Mars, the Viking 1 the Vinking 2, and a MGS, in which all three have been able to locate this face shaped messa in a area called Cydonia. Each time the face become a little less noticiable but stil noticable enough to find.

On April 5th, 1998, the MGS along with Michael Malin and his Mars Obriter Camera flew over Cydonia for the first time. They were albe to snap a picture ten times sharper than the one taken in 1976. The picture was uploaded to the internet, where thousands of wed surfers wher waiting to see what it revealed. to many their theory had been proven to be correct, while others still thought it was a alien built structure. The picture revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. Not everyone was satisfied with the outcome. Some skepticcs said that alien marking were hiden by the haze. The pictures were taken at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter, a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet, causing the Mars Global Surveyor to have to peer through wispy clouds in order to see the face.

The skeptics were right when they said that they had to peek through haze, however they were wrong about the part where they said the haze hid the alien markings.

Garvin addedthat it reminds him most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He then explained,""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars.""

After the first picture of the face on Mars was released to the public, NASA explained the picture is just, ""a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the ilusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" It was later added that it is just another Martian mesa,, common around Cydonia. The only difference that seperates this one form the rest are unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Like the man on the moon, the face on Mars is only a structure that resembals the humans that run Earth. The accidental resemblance is quite astonishing to say the least, thought nevertheless, in reality its ""just anouther Masa"" made by nature not aliens. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
74B1F4463091,"Have you seen the Grand Canyon? Then you probably know that it was not Pual Bunyon who made it, water carved out the Grand Canyon. Nature makes all of the landmarks that we have. Nature can also make landmarks on other planets as well. This is why the Face on Mars has to be a natural formation.

To begin with, I know that the face is a natural landform because it resembles something in the United States. Chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Jim Garvin, thought that the Face resembles Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. He also said it was a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face of Mars. This shows that even one of the top leaders of NASA's Mars Exploration Program believes that this Face is only a natural landform. Besides, NASA would want to find aliens to prove that there is life on Mars.

Equally as important, nobody has proved that there is any other living thing on a planet except for Earth. Mars is too far away from the sun, and there is very little to no oxygen on the surface of Mars. Even if there is life on Mars, it would be mircoscopic organisms, and they could not build a large structure like the Face. This is another reason why the Face is a natural landform.

And finally, if the Face was made by aliens, then wouldn't there have to be some kind of civilization or living area. The aliens would probably want to be somewhat close to their great formation. However, nobody has located any type of civilization on Mars. With the more powerful that NASA had on the latest probe, they said that you could have see things as small as a shack. Plus, if the aliens built one landmark, why not build another one, but nothing else out of the ordinary has been found by scientists. Lastly, nobody has seen a civilization, so the Face could not have been built by aliens.

In conclusion, there is no strong evidence that the Face on Mars is built by aliens. All the facts point to the idea that the Face is just a natural landform. Scientists took planty of pictures of the Face, trying to find whatever made the Face, but they have found nothing. Besides, there is a natural formation that resembles the Face which proves that they both probably formed the same way. Plus, NASA would want there to be living things on another planet besides Earth, but even they reject the idea that the Face was made by aliens. All this shows why the Face on Mars is only a natural landform.",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
5F27FEB9CC44,"Many people think that the face might have been an alien's. I think that the Face is a natural landform because scientists beleive that the eyes,nose and mouth were cause by shadows. Some scientists believe that the face was an alien artifact. Scientists have used better camera that could even show a small shacks. Some say alien markings were hidden by haze.

First, I think the Face was caused by natural landforms because the eyes,nose, and mouth were caused shadows. A few days after the the picture, NASA unveilded the image and the caption noted ""Huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" Some scientists still disagree saying it could have been an alien's face. When looking at the picture, there is a shadow of the rock. If it was an alien, why haven't scientist found any other alien like?

Second, the face was formed by a natural landform because when you look at the 2001 picture it is more clear than 1976 or 1998. The clear version shows that it had no eyes,nose, or mouth. Garvin said ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" Scientists are able to see pictures closer than before. Garvin also said ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" All the new technologies can get the actually picture more clearly unlike the picture from 1976.

Then, scientists have better technoloy, they are able to go to Mar with new machines. Scientists can even go near the Face with new spacecraft adn get a better picture. Other scietists think that alien markings were hidden by haze. Even if they were hidden, scientists would be able to find it by now.

Finally, the Face was formed by natural landform because it was caused by shadows, and scientists have better technology. On 2001, scientists used a camera which were better than the camera they used on 1976. This is why the Face was formed by natural landform.       ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
C1043F3C0609,"Have you ever heard about the thing that happened at NASA twenty five whole years ago? Well it was one of the biggest things that was a thing because they were figuring out if it was a real face or not. It was difficult but i'm pretty sure they found out about it even if it wasn't a face but were about to find out.

The face was a really difficult thing to focus on for as long as they did. I don't think they would've focused on it as much as they did if it wasn't so important to figure out honestly. It was just a shadow they saw out of plain sight while a spacecraft was circling around and then they suddenly saw a shady shadow and it looked like a human face. Only a few days later is when they showed the image they took of they shadow for everyone to see. The face begin to be known and everyone was soon to know about it after they reached out and posted the picture of the unknown face.

There was many obstacles to find out who's face it was. ""Twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planrt, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face"" (Unmasking the Face on Mars,1), This little bit of a paragraph tells us that basically someone was out just snapping pictures and found this. That's overly rare too have something like that happen.

Others might say that think it's all fake but in my prespective I believe that you can't just go and and discover that and it all be fake it's not happening and it never like that. I also believe that it would be hard to take a picture of that thing when you were supposed to do what you were supposed to do. Let people believe that it's ""fake"" but they have prove that's very specific that i cited in paragraph three. This is just beliefs and honesty now others might be different a lot might think different because no minds think the exact same all the time it's simply just what I believe.

All in all my beliefs are still the exact same I'm sticking to what I think is right. Everyone has their own opinion but if it would get bad because people think all differently this is just what I have on mind. The face in my eyes I believe was real because you can't just drop what you're doing and go take a picture of something that's totally fake. Everyone has their own opinion though and that's how I see it.  ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

It revealed a natural landform which meant there was no alien monument. Some skeptics argued that alien markings were hidden by a haze. In 2001 another photo was taken.

57A5CB844EF6,"Twenty five years ago something very uncommon happened on our planet Mars. NASA sent a shuttle taht can take pictures of anything, NASA sent the shuttle out into space. The shuttle NASA sent out was called ""Viking 1"". Viking 1 was a shuttle that took (past tence) pictures of plantes. NASA sent the shuttle out to look for possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2. As the shuttle taking pictures it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. The Human face had a enormous head nearly two miles from end to end. Threw the cameras it seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. Those are some little details about the ""Human Face"".

Even though i'm a scientist at NASA, some of my friends who were also scientist we all agreed it was probably it was just another Martian mesa, they were common around Cydonia, but this one had unsual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. I was dissusing the ""Face"" with someone who thinks it was created by aliens. I was telling him (John) we unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth."" But now that the word got out people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars. He was also saying ""Its evidence that evidence that NASA would rather hide."" Me personally believed the Face was an alien artifact.

And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, so friends Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera which we called (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times shaper than the original Viking photos. We were very anxious to see the picture... the picture revealed ... like we said a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

Everyone wasn't satisfied. The Face on Mars is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter April '98 which was a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camrea on board MGS had to peer though wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.

So then I ordered mission controllers to look again. Mars Global Surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that looks straight down and scans teh planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips.

April 8, 2001 coudless summer day in Cydonia Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough fro a second look. They had to roll the Space craft 25 degrees to center the Fce in the field of view. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best Viking photo. Meaning in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there we objects in this pictures like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks youll know where they were.

The picture showed the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms. So they we never alien sights. Even though John never blieved what i said.                     ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

""This mask is not made from aliens. This was a natural landform that created it self. There was nothing there that shows some life form lived there."" I said.

""The thing that made it could have not been seen on your pictures."" said the enthusiast.

""The machine we used to take the pictures, its pixels spans 1.56 meters. Once you saw them, you could zoom in on them. If there were any life forms on Mars, we would have seen it. Taking the pictures wasn't easy, You had to find the face first and then be able to take a picture. When we finally got the picture, it is more then likely that the cameras didn't mess up. Besides, what kind of thing would be able to create such a face?""

""You never know what's out there.""

""Yes, we do, and we have no evidence of any living creautures on that planet. Therefore, it was made naturally.""

The guy I talked to later became a beleiver that the face was a natural landform. He also got a job at NASA and devoted his job on finding out how the face was made.

FDC5C6E0B4A7,"Mesa's form all of the time and they are a natural occurance and they should not be considered differently just because the land formation looks like a face. Mesa's form due to rocks that pile up nad form when erotion occurs from wind and other nutrients and minerals brush over the rock and the wind loose minerals that cause the Mesa to look like a face.

Nutrients and minerals loosen and crack over time as strong winds blow over formations and look like they are faces, trees, and other land for mations femaninans. the scientists have proven this over the years adn even done tests and studies on certian erotion types. some differnt erosion types are wind, oceans, rain, and other natural causes that over the years have caused thing to fade away mineral by mineral or brick by brick.

As you can see through the pictures as the years go on the cameras used by the space ships adn space things have evolved like erition only differnce is that erosion is bad sometimes, technological advances have occured througout the years and this is even another sign of erotion. Some of the tiem advancements can be abad thing becasue natural resources are lost by advaces and erotion. Stomachs can erode thing by the acids in them. they eat away at the food inside and can be fast or it can be slow.

The ""face"" on the planet mars is considered a face because it looks like one. Humans can look like animals but they arn't, technically. The ""face"" is there becasu eof the mineral build up and the rocksa dn dust that have collected there becasue of the strong winds and the mild winds and just winds in gernal. as the mineral build up grew and the winds picked up the minerals and dust blew away and then went somewhe else.

So this particular arguement is going to be ended by me saying that I am right your wrong and your going to go look all of this up and find out theat erotion and minerals are all natural and then you will come back adn thank me so you dont look odd when some asks you about the ""face"".",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
BBBF0CA12DE1,"The conspiracy about aliens has been starting to go too far. An isolated mesa was found on Mars, but when its picture was taken, it looked like a face. The conspiracy theorists have been thinking that that's the proof that there's life on Mars, but they're wrong. The picture was taken in 2001, which means it was very detailed, so it would've been obvious if there were any tombs or buildings surrounding the mesa. Also, it only looks like a face because of it shadows. The shadows actually shape it into a face. Finally, if it was actually a sign for alien life, it would've profited NASA, so there wouldn't be a point in hiding the ""truth"" that the conspiracy theorists believe. These all show that the Face is just an ordinary rock.

The last picture of the Face was taken in 2001. This was a very detailed picture, even for being taken so long ago. Each pixel in the image was equal to 1.56 meters in real life. This means that any other nearby buildings or tombs would've been seen near the rock. There weren't any buildings or any sign of actual alien life nearby, so the picture at least proved that the Face wasn't a sign from the aliens, but just a rock.

The only reason that the Face looks so much like a face is because of the shadows. Without the shadows, the Face might just look like an ordinary rock on mars. The shadows themself give the illusion of the rock having eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Those shadows are the only reason that the Face IS

the Face.

Without those shadows, the Face wouldn't be so famous. Nobody would have probably ever known or cared about it.

The conspiracy theorists and many people in general probably think that NASA is hiding the fact that aliens are real, so they're lying about the Face and just saying that it's a landform, when they think it's a sign that aliens exist. That's not true. NASA is a company that needs money like all the rest. They know that telling people that aliens were real would profit them a lot, so they wouldn't just hide the fact that the Face was an alien artifact if it was one. NASA probably wishes that they had found an ancient cililization on Mars, just for the profit.

The theorists are wrong about the Face being an ancient artifact. The latest picture of the Face is so detailed, that any ancient civilizations nearby would be visible. Also, the Face is only the Face because the rock has shadows along it that makes it look like it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Finally, NASA would proabably like to find an ancient civilization on Mars, just so that they could profit from finding something related to alien life. They wouldn't just hide the truth if they could gain money from it. Therefore, theorists should just realize that facts are facts, and that if NASA finds an ancient civilization on Mars, they'll tell everyone.",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
3B1B0C830EDD,"Have you ever seen anything unusual and thought that it was just a natural landform, but other people thing it was created by extraterrestials? Well, some people argue that the Face on Mars was created by aliens and some people believe that it was created natural. I believe that the Face formed naturally. I believe this because of the camera quantity and the shadows and clouds of the planet.

First, I am going to discuss the camera quality. The quality of the camera is important so that the picture of the Face is clear. When the scientists first took the picture of the Face in 1976, there was an unclear picture. As time went on the cameras got more and more advanced that to the point you could see every detail of the Face. In 2001, when scientists took a clear picture of the Face, they identified it as a mesa, a natural landform in Western America. Also, they said that if there were any other alien landforms like egyptian pyramids that it would show up in the picture. Last, in the passage it states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This quote from the passage proves that the Face is a natural landform and not created by aliens. This is how the camera quality prove whether or not the Face was created by aliens or is a natural landform.

Next, I am going to discuss how the clouds and shadows of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform. First, the shadows of Mars gives the Face an illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. In the passage it states, ""Huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, mouth."" This shows that the Face is not really a face and it is actually a natural landform. Next, the clouds on Mars can throw off the cameras vision of the face. When the MGS took a picture of the Face when it was cloudly on Mars the picture was unclear and scientists could not see the Face in detail. Although, in 2001 when the MGS explored Mars, it was not cloudy. MGS was able to get a clear picture of the Face and scientists identified it as a natural landform and not an alien creation. This is how the shadows and clouds of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform.

Finally, the camera quality, shadows, and clouds of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform. The better the camera quality the more proof there is to say that the Face is a natural landform. Also, without the clouds and shadows of Mars, the Face is easily identified as a natural landform. To conclude, this is how the quality of the camera, shadows, and clouds of Mars prove that the Face is a natural landform.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

First of all, there is no life on the planet of Mars. For example, they would of seen life when they took the picture. Also, it states that it just looks like an unusual landform. Finally, Mars is to cold for any life because that is why the astronauts have to where suits.

Second, NASA does actual research. For example, NASA actually goes up and looks at it. Also, states that when they went up to the planet they snapped pictures of the ""Face"". Finally, the text stated that it was a huge rock formation that looked like a face.

Lastly, the people that making theories are not always true. For example, the text states that when NASA took the picture, they came up with a theory that claimed ""it was too hazy to see any life."" Also, it stated that they came up with theory that stated that NASA is hiding information about it looks like a bona fide which is evidence that there is life.

Some peopl might think that there is life on Mars because it looks like a bona fide. They are wrong because the picture that was taken didn't include any sign of life.

In conclusion, there is no life on Mars. The pictures didn't show anything about life. Also, the NASA actually goes up to Mars and checks it out.

70FFE7D3E3BE,"As a NASA scientist, I believe that the face on Mars was formed by aliens. Me as well as other scientists believe this because, we still don't know for sure that there's any life on Mars. As well of the fact that a face can't be made randomly on a planet, there had to be something that made it. When you think about it you see nothing Earth or human like on any other planet.

Well we still don't know for sure if there is any other planet with a sign from aliens but, every planet has a special feature to it. For instance Earth has weather elements such as;rain, snow, hail, and mist. Mecury is the nearest to the sun. Venus is made mostly out of gas. And Saturn as well as Uranus has rings. Neptune is the cold icy planet. Then Jupiter is the biggest planet.

Although few scientists believed the face was an alien artcraft, photograpghing Cldonia became a prority for NASA when Mars Global Surbeyor arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking mission ended.

This statement would lead anyone to believe that the details and magnification in a camera 25 years younger and improved would lead to better and more eye capsuring photos right?

Right.

So, why would there be controversey over the likelyhood of the face actually being real?

Here's why: people see something one time and they are automatically drawn into the idea that it has to be real. The Martian Mesa was said to look like a Egyptian Pharaoh. That statement leads people to believe that there had to be life to build something like that. But, with the shadow showing groves perfectly and the holes in the mesa made it look real. The ""Face"" is just another Mesa on Mars.

First, the pixels and the picture produced by the camera at that time weren't as developed as the camera used in 2001. You also have to take into account that, as time goes on, most products will be improved and made better, in this case that's how it was with the cameras, with a 25 year gap in between.

The text says, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" The text also supports the claim by stating, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

Additionally, the shadows had appeared to be hitting the natural landform just right. The scientists belive this because, they have seen many other mesas while traveling in space, this on just happened to have a interesting impression at first sight.

The text proves this by including, ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusoin of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

The text also says, There must have been a degree of spurise amoung mission controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared on their monitors. But the sensation was short lived. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia only this had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

Believers in this ""face"" may claim there was never a clear picture of the ""face"" taken after the first photo.

To support this they may think that the photographer taking the picture may not be able to see the clouds. The text says, ""But not everyone was satisfied. The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 - a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.

The text says, ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 - a cloudless summer day in Cydonia - MGS drew close enough for a second look. What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa.""

The Face captured on Mars has proven to be a natural landform. With shadows covering it and dips to make facial features it can across as an Egyptian Pharaoh.

One other reason I think it is a landform is because, if aliens were to create the enourmus structure, how would they do it and why would they do it?

Although it resembled a face in the first picture it doesn't necesarrily mean it was created by life forms to look like a face. The only features you can make out on the so-called ""Face"" are deep holes for eyes, a pointed part for the nose, and a line for the mouth. It doesn't have any distinct features. If if was made my martians they most likely wouldn't want a monument of a human's face so what is it supposed to be? I'll you what it is butte or mesa, a natural landform that is common on Earth.

Another reason you know it isn't a face is the camera quality of the first image. The camera quality in 1976 wasn't as advanved as today's technology is. The pictures in both 1998 and 2001 were both much more clear than the original photograph. Although you can make out somewhat of a face it doesn't mean thats what it was.

Conspriacy theorists say it actually was aliens and they made the face but NASA would greatly benefit from finding actual life on Mars. If NASA found legitimate alien lifeforms it could benefit the whole world. If they were non-hostile they could teach us how to make and use their technology. We could learn a lot from them, like why the landforms on their planet resemble faces. NASA has been trying to find alien life for years, if they found it they woudln't deny them and say they don't exist.

There are a lot of people that think it has to be a face. And the pictures are from 25 years apart, so anything could have happened to the landform in that long. Natural wear and tear could have washed across the surface of it and rendered it a natural landform. In all seriousness they could be right but it would take a lot more than 25 years to ruin solid rock.

The ""Face on Mars"" had a good 25 year run. It was mostly scaring people and giving conspiracy theorists ammunition to shoot at the government to try to get us to admit there is other life out there, but its time to face reality. It is not a face. It really is a landform. If there was life on Mars you could see it with the cameras we have today, but sadly, no such luck. It's not a face on Mars, we just have imaginations that run wild with wonder.",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
EDF2DA7EB7EB,"Many people are thinking that the ""face"" on Mars is an actual face, or they say it was created by aliens. It was proven very well that it is not an actual face. One it is an rock, two the angle the camera was at cought the shadow of it so it seemed as if it was a face, and three the only reason it was told to be a face was for marketing.

My first reason was because it is a rock on mars. It states in paragraph three that it is a huge rock in formation of a human head. therefore that is one reason it is showing everyone that it is just a rock. The rock over the years has wathered down and it has more crevisises and it is losing the foerm of a face. If there was an actual face barryed under there it would never really lose its true form.

My second reason is that the angle of the camera was so that you can see the shadow and if they just wouldve gotten a better angle you woyld be able to see that there was nothing really there. If you were too also look at othere surroundings you would be able to see that there are many other masas on Mars. It also states that it may have been the pixles in the cameras. If we had the technology we have now when they first found it you would most likely have a better picture of it and be able to see what it actually looked like.

My final reason for it not being a face is that the only reason they continued on the theory of it being a face because they wanted good marketing. So itr seemed as if they kept the theory continued because they wanted to have marketing for NASA. Obviously it worked, because the story stated that they started to have hollywood film it appeared in books, magazines, and even raido talks.

Thoes are my reasonings that the ""face"" on Mars is actually just a rock. It was proven to be just another one of the many rocks on mars, the angle of the camera could've been off, the kept the theory going just for marketing.      ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
EFA8B282D9AC,"A face on mars! NASA found a face on mars that is said to be a natural landform but many think it is alien creation. There are many reasons that shows that claim of it being an alien creation is false for example there have been 3 pictures of the ""face"" the face looks different in each, it is a lava dome, and there is not a reason for NASA to keep it a secret.

In the article they give 3 pictures to look at and in each one the landform looks a little different because of the new advance technology. For example the picture in 1976 yes it does look like a face but that could be just because of the low camera quality at the time of the picture taken. The picture could've been anything at the time a rock formation is and was the logical explanation for this. For example in the second picture taken in 1998 the landform is a little blurry but easier to see and in this picture it doesnt resemble a face at all it was revealed to be a natural landform. The example shows that NASA confirmed that it is just a natural landform and is not an alien creation. It does not even look like a face in the sharper picture take in 1998. The last example is the picture taken in 2001. Many thought that the picture taken in 1998 was not proving anything because it would have been winter in mars so the picture had to be taken through wispy clouds so they went again in 2001 they went on a cloudless summer day. For example in the passage it says,"" Malin's team captured an extra ordinary photo using the camera's absoulte maximum resolution."" The example shows that NASA took an amazing clear photo revealing that it is just a land form.

In the article there are three different missions. In the first mission they fiqures it was just another common Martian mesa. For example in the text it says,"" Scientist fiqured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows."" The example shows that they said that it is just mesa with unusual shadows. The next mission sais that it is indeed a natural landform. For example in the story it says,""Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginial viking photos and posted on a JPL web site revealing a natural landform."" The example shows that the new cameras showed that it was just a landform but that still wasnt enough evidence to some. The third mission was in 2001. For example in the text it says,"" a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look."" The example shows that this mission was on a cloudless day so there would be nothing blocking the view of the landform. All three missions they all agreed it was just a natural landform

Why would NASA want to hide it and there is enough evidence that it is just a natural landform There would be no reason to ""hide"" if aliens were found. For example in the text it says,""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on mars."" The example shows that if there was a civilzation they would not keep it a secreat because they could get more money to study it and in the long run more money for discovering it. Another example is in the story it says,"" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes ont he ground or Eqyptian-style pryamids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" The example shows that if there was ancient civilization there they had to live somewhere and we would be able to see their shacks. The last example is in the story it says,"" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equaivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of the middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" The example shows that it is a butte or mesa and it even looks like the middle butte in the River. There is no way the ""face"" is anything but rocks.

In conclusion there is no evidence what so ever that the landform is an alien creation.

CE5997CDA966,"In May of 1976, a space ship that was looking for a landing site on Mars snapped a very interesting photo. The blurry photo clearly resembled a human face. The picture led a lot of people to think that the structure was build by aliens. However, this statement has been proven wrong by scientific evidence. The structure wasn't built by aliens because a more up to date photo of the same spot has proven that it is just a mass of rock.

Up until around 1998, a large amount of people believed that the image of the blurry face was evidence of an alien civilization. On April 5, 1998 however, scientists were finally ale to take another picture of the same spot with more up to date technology. The new image revealed that it was just a bunch of rocks.

Scientists say that the blurry face could've been caused by a thick haze that was on that part of the planet when the original photo was taken. They said it was a cloudy day when the photo was taken, so the fae could've been created by the combination of the clouds and the shadows.

Now that a more up to date photo was released, some people have dropped the whole idea of an alien civilization, however, some people still believe that there could still be alien life elswhere. This could be true, but as for the blurry face photo, it was all just a trick of the eye.             ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

On the other hand, there are people that beleive it is just a mesa, ""landorrms common around the American West."" There are many people in both parties, making for a huge ""debate."" The most logical, however, is that the Face is naturally occuring, due to the evidance that NASA has been able to uncover.

The people that say it is an ancient civilization use illogical evidance for their conclusions, such as, ""alien markings were hidden by haze."" However, the people that believe it is naturally occuring use stable evidance, including, ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.' Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This evidance shows that the best technology we have shows nothing more than, ""a lava dome that takes the form of and isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Another way to show that the Face on Mars is naturally occuring is the comparison to the lanforms here on Earth, such as the mesa landforms in the American West. In the passage, Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist at NASA, working specifically on Mars exploration, is quoted saying,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.""

1D29E38F92F8,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face of Mars"", a theory is presented to the readers, that alien life form could have caused the '""face on mars"". There are diffrent reasons on why that image is there, besides ""aliens"" put it there. It could be butte mesa. Also cameras sent in space would have picked up on something unusual. Scientist don't present a theory unless they have evidence to back it up.

One reason that the ""face on mars"" is there, is butte mesa. Which is usually shadows that make it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Butte mesa are found in West America, one example of the butte mesa is in Snake River Plain of Idaho. Which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. The mesa located in Idaho is about the same height as the Face on Mars.

Another thing, is that cameras are sent into space to take pictures of planets and record everything that is found. Scientist enlarge the photos 3 times bigger, to see everthing within it. If there were anything in the picture that seemed unusual, the cameras would allow you to see it. Any objects, like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyrsmids. Even small shacks, you would be able to see it.

Thirdly, scientists don't present a theory unless they have gone threw precautions and looked over all of there evidence to support the theory. In the article it talks about how the scientists, sent two diffrent cameras up to make sure the clouds wren't the issue of what they saw. Also, they blew the images up to see if there was an objects. To make sure that nothing could endanger there theory, of it just being a butte mesa. If the scientists really didnt believe there theory was valed, they would'nt have taken so many precautions.

In conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is probably just a naturally occuring landform on Mars. With the evidence of the butte mesa in West America. The cameras going up and taking pictures more than once. Also, the scientists taking many precautions to prove that the ""Face on Mars"", is a butte mesa.

9FD57C4F0DF8,"There have been conspiracy theories going around that the Face on Mars is actually created by aliens, but it can be proven to everyone that the claims are false. The Face is simply a natural landform, and NASA is not trying to hide or distort the truth. Some may still be skeptical, but there is proof that the Face is not an alien monument of any sort.

As stated before, the Face is actually a natural landform. It's the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa found commonly in the American West. Fellow researcher, Jim Garvin, even states that it reminds him of the ""Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho""(paragraph 12). It can be proven that Earth landforms definitely aren't made from aliens, and the same could be said for the Face.

The Face isn't even an actual face, so it's unlikely it even is an alien monument. The only reason the rock formation resembles a face is because the shadows cast an illusion of facial features such as eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Pictures of the Face were captured two other times using the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Skeptics may believe that NASA messed up somewhere or that something was flawed, but it is highly unlikey that this is true. The procedure was performed on a cloudless summer day with the best camera at NASA's disposal.

Some skeptics may still doubt that the Face wasn't created by aliens, believing that NASA is just attempting to hide the evidence of an ancient civilization. In truth, this is false, but many defenders of the NASA budget wish there were signs of alien life. How can one believe NASA is keeping secrets about alien life from the public when it would benefit to do the opposite. Proof of an alien civilization would be more helpful to share than hiding it, so why do people believe otherwise?

Whether or not people believe the Face is actual just a Martian landform, it doesn't affect the researchers of NASA.

82A897369EA2,"Now today I am going to disprove your statement that aliens created the Face seenon the red planet of Mars. The first thing that you have wrong is that the Face seen on Mars is of alien orgin. The Face that you see in the picture is just an oddly shaped Martian mesa. In fact there are very common on that region of Mars so for all we know there could very well be more oddly shaped mesas in that area.

The fact is that you miss read the caption of the picture or didn't even look at it at all. If you would've you should have seen the caption stating that the reason it resembles a human head is because of the shadows giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. The only reason the let people see that photo is because they wanted more people to be intrested more in Mars.

Plus on April 5, 1998 NASA reaveled to everyone on their website the Face was mearly an oddly shapped Natural landform.

In conclusion there are several ways that we could disprove your statement. The first being that it is just a mesa which dosen't have a distinct form, which means that if another one forms it could very well be a dog or a cat. The second being that you may have just miss read or not have read the caption. Which clearly states that the reason the Face looks like that is because of the shadows and thats why it has a mouth, a nose, and eyes.

First, they have updated images showing it is a rock formation, just like here on Earth. Second, if it could prove aliens once lived, or currently live on Mars, then NASA would not hesitate to publish it. The Mars face is only a natural rock formation.

There are newer images proving it is a rock. With our growing technology we sent spacecrafts close to Cydonia, and they show rock formations. This rock formation is much like what we have on Earth. The shadows cast upon the rock, giving it facial features. On a different day, those shadows are not there.

Why would NASA keep this a secret? NASA would thrive from finding alien lifeforms. Why would they keep that private. As the story states, "" Defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" They want that, because their budget would increase and they could do better projects if they had published it.

Nerws articles claimed it was a rock formation long before any conspiracy theories were out. Soon, after the second shot of it, scientists proved it was just another rock formation that resembles many we have here on Earth today.

Even though the photos look like they have facial features, and could be the remains of an ancient alien civilization, it is not. Some facts to back it up are that NASA would not hide something this benefitual to them from the public, scientists have proven it was made naturally by rock, and better resolution photos prove that it is just a rock formation with shadows showing facial features.

F2A79A33B020,"Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing unatural about the supposed ""Face on Mars"". Though many would like to believe in the supernatural, this oddity is nothing but a rock formation. There are several reasons as to why the theory of aliens making this formation is preposterous, each reason stronger than the previous.

First and foremost, if these photos of the alleged face were the work of possible Martians, NASA would have found further evidence by now. Even if the cameras used to take these pictures weren't of the highest quality, said cameras would have been able to at least catch some photos of further signs of life. Things such as houses or buildings, for example. Now, if some one would like to argue that the aliens lived in caves or other natural formations of the sort, how would those people like to argue the fact that there are no visible creatures in any photos? Do they expect people to believe that every living thing on Mars decided to hide from a satelite they would not even be able to see from the surface?

Additionally, even if NASA had found this further evidence, why would the company try to hide it? Not only would releasing such infrormation to the public leave NASA with all sorts of world renouned achievements, it would be more than beneficial for the company's financial standpoint. Releasing statements as big as signs of life on Mars would do wonders for the company. The more achievements, the more sponsors will see the potential in investing money in a program such as NASA. Adding to that, the more sponsors, the more projects NASA can fund, and by extension, the more the foundation will be able to learn and teach the public.

Probably the most obvious piece of evidence that busts the idea of unknown life, is that these photos were taken in 1976 (according to paragraph 5 of Unmasking the Face on Mars) . Technology at that time was still fairly primitive, especially for space travel. The photo just happened to be taken at the right time, at the right angle, by a pilgrim piece of technology. Further pictures, such as the ones taken in 2001, reveal that the ""face"" is just a mesa, with next to no details that resemble that of a human complextion. Think of it as the

""...Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho..."" (paragraph 12)

All in all, this ""face"" on Mars is no different from other conspiracies. Things like the picture of the Loch Ness Moster, the famous photo that was confirmed to be faked. Another good example is the ""Bigfoot"" craze. Both cases are similar to this one because all are just photos that are hard to be certain about, that sparked international interest.

Now just like this astronaut, there are probably hundreds of people that think that the ""Face on Mars"" is some sort of alien monuent, but in reality science and logical thinking has proven that in reality, the ""Face on Mars"" is really just a Mesa almost identical to the ones found out in the American West.

First off is the logical thinking portion. In the region of Cydonia mesas are incredibly common.

Now this particular mesas is oddly shapped, I will give it that, but it is just a mesa. What gives it human fetures is just the shadows. Just look at 1976 Viking one photograph. You can clearly see shadows Just look slightly below it, you can see a long shadow protruding from the mesa. Now on the flip side, look at the picture captured on 1998 when it was cloudy out and there were no shadows at all. The image just makes it look like a weird rock, not like a human face at all.

While still on the topic of the photographs, the one snapped on 2001 also proves that the so called ""Face on Mars"" is really just a mesa becouse of not the actual formation, but the surronding area. It was taken by a very high quality camera. In fact, it's pixles spanned 1.56 meters whereas the best Viking photograph the pixles spanned 43 meters. That ment that you could zoom in around the area of the mesa to scan if there was any other evidence of alien life. So scienteists and analysts could scan the sourrounding area for pyramids or buildings, but they found absolutly nothing that would sugest that aliens are present in the region.

Lastly, lets all say that the so called face really was an ancient alien structure, why would NASA keep it a secret. I mean, NASA is really short on funding, but if it was proven that there was aliens on Mars, then that would mean NASA funding probaly would go through the roof. What better goal could NASA have then to make conatact with extratrestrialls. This must mean that the ""Face on Mars"" is just another mesa. What organization would pass up the opprotunity to get through the roof funding.

So just face the facts. The ""Face on Mars"" is just a mesa that had well placed shadows that are one in a million. So don't be Jeff the astronaut, and just face the facts early on as oposed to having high hopes and dreams just to have them crushed by even more scientifically proven evidence.

8C8AC3D7768E,"Aliens may or may not be real, but if they were they could not make this. I know this is just a natural landform. Yes it is weird that this landform looks like a face i agree with that, but saying aliens made it is just crazy. Here are some reasons on how i know and can prove that aliens did not make this.

First if aliens did make this how could they make it. They had to have some kind of machine or something they couldn't have just built it with there hands. So if they did make it we would of seen how like some machine like i said before. Also they would of left some kind of foot mark or something they couldn't have and not left a single mark.

The second reason is if aliens made it don't you find it weird that it looks like a human face. Where or how would they get the idea of making it look like our faces. The only way they could do that is if they went to earth and saw our faces there and if there aliens on earth NASA would be the first to know.

The third reason is in unmasking the face on mars it says in paragraph 12 ""What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landform common around the American West."" Then to prove it even more it says this. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an islolated mesa about the SAME height as the face in mar."" So that just said that these ""faces"" are common around the American West and I'm pretty sure aliens are not on earth. So unless aliens came to earth made a face and then left without NASA seeing it would be impossible.

These are my 3 reasons on why i think it is impossible that aliens made it. It's just a natural form. I am not saying aliens are not real but i am saying that they did not make this face without us seeing it.              ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
5AA661892978,"Some people say that ""The Face on Mars"" is something that was built by ancient aliens, much like the theories that people come up with about the structures on Earth. Some people have even stated that the ""aliens"" could be trying to cover it up by hiding it during the time they take it. Then there are the firm believers that this is just a land mass that consists of the surroundings and resembles a mesa type biome. Since there have been developments over time, showing the different variations of the ""face"" and what it has become over the years. There are different arguements and different points of view, but there are different time periods with different variations of the same thing, so it will be proven that is is a natural land mass, and not a martian made structure.

There is a lot of things that points toward this being a natural land mass and that it is not a Martian made structure, or that the Government is trying to cover it up. One thing that shows that it is a natural structure is when the article states, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough aroud Cydonia..."" This means that there are multiple things like this, but the only things that make this one different is the fact that is has ""unusual shadows"" in it that make it look human or like a structure that was built. After this happened and people got news of it and figured out it wasn't real, the Conspiracy Theorists came out and made it seem like a cover up, but this isn't true, because NASA could have gotten publicity from it, as well as many funds. This mesa is no different from anything that we have in Western United States, there we have many mesas that could look equally as strange, but we don't bother, because we want to believe that there is other life, or that there is something strange going on in other planets.

Over the years, the images of this land mass have gotten more and more clear, and we have come to realize, that no, it is not a face, but it is a large point with shadowy parts in it. From the picture from 1976, it is really blurry, and you can't really tell what it is, which is what got people hopes up and thought it may be a structure, due to the shadows and the formation around it. The 1998 one is a bit clearer, but it still is a bit unclear of what it is or could be, because it does look like it could be something like the Sphinx in Egypt, but with the same formation around it. The 2001 image looks way more clear, and this one shows something completely different than what we expected, it is just a regular mesa, with cracks, dips and shadows, and the same formation around it as before. There is something you can tell about the 2001 picture though, if you look closely, it is the same image as all the others, because you can see the dips in it where the ""eyes"" and ""mouth"" are, just more clear so they don't really show up, and since everything is more clear, you can see the cracks, which could have added to the effect.

Even after all of the theories that were made, and NASA defending themselves, as well as people trying to prove them wrong, and prove that there was something that the government did to cover it up. All of this could still be fought, who knows, there could be life out there somewhere besides on Earth, but as of now, there is no proof, and this image will still remain a natural land structure. Some people are dissapointed by this, others are motivated to keep moving and possibly one day find some signs of life, so maybe humans would be prepped and set in case of disaster. There is nothing wrong with personal opinions, but for the most part and from what pictures and plenty of evidence have proven, this is still no more than a natural occurence do to the way land forms over time. So even though people may keep looking for any signs of something that could be a conspiracy, or you just want to find something ""supernatural"" or strange, but the fact stands that there are many thing like this, and just because it is on a different planet, does not make it anymore special, and it doesn't make it any different.",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
28A31D350C06,"In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars when it spotted what appeared to be a likeness of a human face in a region called Cydonia. Over the years there has been speculation that this ""face"" was created by aliens. But over the years new equiptment has revealed the ""face"" for what it is: a mesa.

There are three key points of evidence that disprove the alien theory: the equiptment first used to photograph the Face on Mars is rudimentary compared to the equiptment used for the 2001 image, the sky was clear on Mars when the 2001 image was taken, and Earth has similar landforms on its surface. For example, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spams 1.56 meters, compared to the 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" Technology has advanced much from since 1976 and 2001 image is a clear example. The 2001 image also has another detail that can't be left out: it was taken on a cloudless Martian day. A last piece of evidence sure to disprove the alien theory is the fact that Earth has similar landforms on its surface. The Face on Mars, ""...is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""

To conclude, the Face on Mars was not created by aliens. The image from 1976 was photographed with equiptment that is rudimentary compared to the equiptment used for the 2001 image, the Martian sky was cloudless when the 2001 image was taken, and the 2001 image proved that the Face on Mars is the Martian equivalent of a mesa, something commonly found on Earth.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
C9F79E2B45C6,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a famous landmark on, you guessed it, Mars! Many people believe that it is just a natural landform, but others believe it was created by aliens. Why do people believe that it's created by aliens? Well, they believe that the Face is bona fide proof that there is life on Mars, and NASA is hiding something from us. In my personal opinion, I believe that it's just a natural landform that just happens to look like a face. I think that because I think the odds of aliens creating a face on Mars out of no where is very illogical. So in this essay, I'm going to prove to you that the ""Face of Mars"" is actually a landform instead of an actual alien artifact!

One of the main reasons I believe that it is just a natural landform is because according to the article, mesas are something that is common around a region of Mars called Cydonia. And since the face was located in Cydonia, it wouldn't be out of place for there to be a mesa there. So in the beginning, scientists told everyone what it really was, another Martian mesa, but it was shaped like a face. But many people noted something that was in the article in paragraph 2, where it said that the mesa had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. My explanation for this is maybe the mesa was formed a certain way that made it have these out of place shadows, because not every mesa is alike and some may have different shapes than another. Also according to the article, it notes that very few scientists believe that it is an alien artifact, which means there are someone skeptics among scientists, and sure, scientists may be smarter than the average person, but that does not mean they are always correct.

Now we move along to even more important evidence, the pictures. The pictures are important because if you look at the picture of the ""Face on Mars"" taken in 1976, you could see that it really isn't that clear, but you can make out a face in it. But if you look at the better pictures in 1998 and 2001, you can see that they're a whole lot clearer than the ones in 1976. Right now I'm focusing on the one taken in 1998, which according to the article, it was posted on a JPL website where it was revealed as a natural landform. But skeptics again were skeptic as always, and said that since it was taken during the winter, which is a cloudy time on Mars, that the alien markings of the Face were hidden by haze. My reponse to this is, if there were alien markings, why couldn't you make a brief outline of them in the picture from 1976? And how do you know for sure that there are any alien markings? Many questions arose and taken pictures of the Face became a priority.

3 years later, on April 8, 2001, another picture of the Face was taken. This one was much clearer than the one in 1998 due to there being no clouds. According to the article, the pxiel size in the image was 1.56 meters, and as rule of thumb, if there were any alien markings or another of that sort, they would've been able to be seen in the picture because of the pixels. So the ""Face on Mars"" was got rid of its skeptics and now many scientists say it is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. According to the article, Garvin says it remind him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, because it is about the same height of the ""Face on Mars"".

So in conclusion, the ""Face on Mars"" is a mesa plain and simple, and the main reasons are because of the pictures, and overall the really big reason many mesas are common around Cydonia, which is where the Face is located. Another reason why I don't think that you should believe that it is an alien artifact is, there is so much evidence to why it isn't whenever people just pointed out obvious things in the picture, like clouds of haze covered ""markings"" in the 1998 picture but there weren't ever markings on the mesa as revealed in the next picture taken in 2001. So to end this essay, the ""Face on Mars"" is a mesa, not an alien artifact as many skeptics believe.               ",6,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
19EA99155FB8,"Have you seen or heard about the Face on Mars. You probably have on its been starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazinesw, radio talk shows, even in grocery store checkouts lines for 25 years! NASA is researching this closely. The Face is just a natural landform because how would aliens make a face in the middle of Mars? Why would they? In Mars there's all sort of natural landforms so who knows?

How would aliens make a face in Mars? Why? I don't know either its kind of seems impossible. Aliens might have step on it to make it look like a Face but they would have made it on purpose. To me it does look like an Egyptian Pharaoh but back then they were barely finding out what Mars was or didn't even know about Mars. On April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over to Cydonia they took pictures then times sharper than the original pictures, then when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing it was a natural landform. There was no alien manument after all.

In Mars theres all sort of natural landforms created by Mars weather that makes landforms look cool and interesting. When NASA send viking 1 it was circling the planet getting phtos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. Thats when NASA started reseaching it. In April 5, 1998, it was proven that it was just natural landform. Through the years the face starts cracking and fading away because of the weather. The weather of Mars is usually unpredictable, but usually cold. Also the wind in Mars is pretty commen and it makes the land look like a lot of weird things!

So Mars makes all type of natural landforms and why would aliens make a face in Mars? How? I dont know either. Its all of about Mars weather that makes this natural landforms, but its mostly the wind. It looks like an Egyption Pharoah but later on it starts disappearing because of the conditions of Mars. So don't let those ""unrealistic"" aliens trick you.           ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
3AD3CBF899CB,"As a NASA scientist I know more about how the Face is not made from aliens. First off how would aliens create the face because they probably never seen a human. We never seen any evidence that supports that aliens are real. So how would aliens create the face if we don't have any evidence that they are real?

The face is made from rocks. Rocks like from Mars. The face is just a natural landform nothing else. Since the Face is made from Rocks and is on Mars it is called a mesa. Its basically a huge rock formation eveyone would say, even I would say it. There might have been an ancient civillization there, but we are still finding out new stuff everyday.

Yes the face has been a pop icon. It has appeared in many books, magazines even radio talk shows. Some people even think that it is possible that there is somehow life there on Mars.

You shouldn't believe that aliens really did make the face. We don't have any proof that aliens are even real. So we can't say that aliens made the face. Since there are humans are Earth then there could probably once have been humans on Mars, but we have no clue at all. So far its just a natural landform since we have no proof its made from humans or even possible aliens. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
55B23DF63AEC,"The Face on Mars was at first just a shadowy likeness of a human face. Yet, as we focused more and more into the Face the more superficial it became. Is it a Martian? Is there life on Mars?

Well, from the evidence given, it is very likely that the superstions are false, and the Face is just a landform.

The Face was captured again on April 5, 1998 by the MOC which gave a sharper photo. That alone was enough proof to show that the Face is just a landform. Even though it was very cloudy around Mars around that time, it would still be difficult to pass over the Face. The MOC scans over the planet with narrow 2.5 km-wide strips which would make it very hard to miss over the Face.

Lastly on April 8, 2001 NASA captured an extraordinarry photo of the Face. It was a cloudless, summer day which squelched all objections of it being too cloudy around Cydonia to capture a good photo. Each pixel in the photo spans 1.56 meters, whereas the best photo in 1976 only had 43 meters per pixel. The photo was so spectacular that you could zoom in 3 times the pixels size, so even if there were life, small shacks, or pyramids on Mars, you'd be able to see them.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is just a landform. the 2001 photo gives enough evidence that even if there were life or monuments on Mars you would be able to see them. The photo in 1998 was also a good photo, so good that it would be hard to even miss over the Face. Also, even if there were life on Mars NASA would have no reason to hide it, it would help their company more than it would be a detriment to it.

8B089956C35E,"Things aren't always as they appear, just because it looks that way doesn't necessarily mean that it is that way. The formation on Mars does look like a face but it is just a land formation it's not like land formations are rare. Coincidences happen all the time, this is just one of those times. You can't judge something based on how it's looked, you have to really pay attention.

Formations are a very common thing, both on Earth and on Mars. It is nothing strange, what is strange is that it looks like a head. But even at the picture was taken in 1976 with a much lower quality of camera so things wouldn't have looked as clear as a more modern camera, the other picture was taken in 2001, technology would have advanced and improved much in that time span as it was 25 years later. The quality would have improved so it would have been much easier to see and to know what it really was, it was just a coincidence and coincidences are just as common as land formations.

Coincidences happen a lot, and this is just one of the instances that it happens. It may look like a face and something that was made but when you look at it again, with a different perspective you see what it really is. Like sometimes you will have food, like chips and it will look like a face or an object, but just because it looks like that doesn't mean that is that. Or sometime you will see something, but then have to look again to see if that's really what you saw, it's the same concept. Just because you see it doesn't mean it is that or that is even there. Magic is a good example as it is just an illusion, it's happening in front of you but that doesn't mean it's actually there, because when you see how it's really done it's not so magic. The clouds may look like animals floating in the sky but they are still just clouds. All of this brings it back to the same point, that the land formation may look like a face that was created but when you really look at it and realize what it is you know what it really is, just another land formation.

You may say that aliens made something like this but that just doesn't make sense. That's like saying that people made the Grand Canyon or that people made the Rocky Mountains. These things would have made by what was there and things that affected them, not by people or aliens. There is no evidence that aliens even exist, so with lacking that proof how can you say something that never existed or at least something that is unable to be proved existed made this.

It all loops and loops and loops. You end up with the same thing and it just becomes repetitive. You can say that aliens made this but you lack proof, where as it's just a land mass has plenty of evidence to back it up. It is just a coincidence that it looked like a face.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
0F6E3A24C488,"I think that the face on the surface of mars is a natural landform. I dissagree that it is made by aliens or any living organism.

The reason I think that the face is a natural landform is because if it was made by aliens then I think there would be more of them not just one. With us humans we have many different statues monuments tall skyscrapers not just one of them. For example the pyramids they we obviously were not naturally made but there are many of them that are exactly the same. So if that was made by aliens I feel like there would be many more that resembled the landform or some other odd landforms.

In the 12th paragraph of the article it says this is a martian equivalent of a Butte or mesa so there are many things that are odd that happned naturlly on Earth also. In the passage Garvin said,""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the snake river plain of Idaho"". Garvin also said,""That there is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa that is about the same height as the face on mars.""

My next point is that many people say that N.A.S.A

is just keeping secrets of aliens away from the public. If there were aliens than N.A.S.A would probably tell them becuase it would get them so much more publicity and therefore probably more money to fund a mission to mars. So I think that would just be a stupid idea if they kept it a secret.

Like the many types of different natural landmarks we have on Earth.

We have taken more pictures of the Face on Mars that don't show any evidence of alien life on Mars. The most recent being the one we took on April 8, 2001 on a camera that takes pictures with better resolution that helps us see more then just the Face but also anything else that could be around the Face, like, pyramids, airplanes, and small shacks.

And the picture was take on a cloudless day in Cydonia so it is more clearly seen in the photo.

This is why I think it is a natural landform.

So if you think that this "" Face"" was created by alien life then you are wrong because I can tell you that there are no life on Mars what so ever. We know this because we have spacecrafts flying around Mars taking pictures every second of everyday of every year. This is why it is just a natural landform.

It looks like a normal rock on Earth just with a face that was created by the way it was formed. This is one reason that it is a natural landform.

Another reason that is a natural landform is because my good buddy Garvin says that "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Which is a lava dome that takes the shape of an isolated mesa around the same height as the face on Mars. Im am telling this because land masses can form anywhere and look like anything. That is another reason it is a landform.

My last reason it is just a landform that you can find anywhere is that the first photo was taken in 1976, back then we didnt have the technology we have now. In 1976 we had a camera that had the range of 43 meters per pixel, which is not good. Now in 2001 we had a camera that had 1.56 meters per pixel which is the best at the moment. The picture in 1976 does look like a face but in the picture in 2001 it looks like a normal rock with a lot of cracks in it. That is my last reason of how it is a natural landform.

Those were my reasons to try and convince you that the rock on Mars is just a natural landform. My reasons were that there has been no signs of life on Mars. My second reason was that it looks like every other rock i have seen on this Earth. And my last reason is that we have a lot better technology then we did back in 1976.

This happend 25 years ago, and people are still fussing about how this was created by aliens. This is impossible because there is no life on Mars. This ""face"" is just a natural landform. Many years ago scientists thought it was a sign of life too, but this was short lived. Soon after they thought this, they figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, where the spacecraft was circling when they found the face.

Soon after the scientists saw this unusual Martian mesa, they released it to the press so everyone could see. The ""Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon.

7D216074395B,"Some people believe that The Face on Mars was created by aliens. It's good to use your imaginations, but sadly, that wouldn't be the case. Most to even all evidence proves that The Face is simply a natural landform on Mars, similar to natural landforms on Earth. It's a common happening, and the most logical answer.

Us scientists at NASA have been researching The Face for years. Sure, the first picture of The Face did resemble that of a human face, or an Egyptian Pharaoh as it says in paragraph 2 of the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", but since then we've been able to get better, higher-quality pictures that show that what made The Face look like a face was simply shadows. The Face is a landform on Mars, and that's simply it. It's similar to ""landforms common around the American West"", as it states in paragraph twelve, it's the ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" here on Earth.

If that doesn't convince you that it's not aliens that created The Face, hopefully this will. In paragraph 5 of the article on The Face, it states ""Some people think the Face is 'bona fide' evidence of life on Mars -- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This isn't true. If NASA were to find life on Mars, it would benefit us. We wouldn't have a reason to hide it. As proof, that's also stated in paragraph 5, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Now, if defenders of our budget wish that there were ancient civilizations on Mars, don't you think we wouldn't hide it? This shows that it would benefit us if it were that, proving further that aliens aren't the creators of The Face.

If you're still not convinced, look at the picture we took of The Face on April 5, 1998, ""when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time"". NASA got a picture ""ten times sharper than the original Viking photos"", as stated in paragraph 7. This means that it was much easier to see The Face, and what it actually was. The pictures revealed something amazing... the Face was ""a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" I know, shocking! But these are just the facts. Some argued that is was cloudy that day on Mars, so ""alien markings were hidden by haze"", as it states in paragraph 8. So we took a better picture on April 8, 2001 - an uncloudy day on Mars - showing, again, that it was just a landform. Nothing more to it.

In conclusion, the Face is just a natural landform on Mars, similar to those here on our home planet, Earth. As far as anyone knows, even NASA, there are no life-forms on Mars of any kind that made The Face.

BD195459F3B9,"The ways we know that the face is just a natural land form and not something created by Aliens is because we have done real research on the Landform. Not only that but when we took the pictures we used our cameras absolute maximum resolution so it would be as clear as possible. Plus the evidence has changed. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. So we know that the planet is changing and thats how we know that the landform isn't created by Aliens. Plus we have a Surveyor which is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down and scans the planet like a fax machine in narrow 2.5 km-wide strips. The number one way we know it is a land form and not something created by Aliens is because As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!.

32AA6576C80B,"I'm a scientist at NASA and I know that the face is just a natural landform. I have plenty of reasons why that is, and why it wouldn't be an alien. Yes, the face on Mars has become a pop icon, but that doesn't mean people could just assume it's an alien. NASA has plenty information and data for why it's just a natural landform. I'll explain my thinking as me being a scientist at NASA.

My first reason is that NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The picture noted a huge rock formation which seemed to be a human head that had eyes, nose, and mouth. You just have to think about it, those characteristics are obvious. I mean yes, it was found in Mars, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been a human. People just have to think more into the possible and not the impossible, because everything is possible.

My second reason is that they photographed the face. Other scientists at NASA saw that it clearly looked like a human head. My third reason is that they even snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos! When the image first appeared on a JPL web site, it clearly revealed a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.

This is why I, as a scientist at NASA think it's a natural landform and not an alien . these three reasons I have should make people think about it again and decide it's officially a human head. Those who believe it's an alien, should believe more in miracles. Anything could happen in Mars or any other place around the planet. This is only my opinion, but it sure makes me feel like I'm right about my thinking.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
9B45A6BE4E2D,"Can aliens really create a face on the moon? No, they cant! I know this because the picture snapped of the face from 1976, was bit blurry, once they got abetter camera the picture became more clear and looked less like a face. Only some of the scientist beleived the face was a 'alien artifact'. There is proof that it is just a landform that looks like a face.

The picture from 1976 was a bad quality picture, it was blurry and you couldnt see much of the real features that were there. Once cameras got better and more HD the pictures got more clear and you could actually see the cracks and the rough parts if the landform. In 2001, the picture was good, it looked less like a face when the cameras got better, but it still had that face effect on it.

Only some of the scientist beleived that the face looking land form was created by aliens, not all. When they snapped the first picture in 1976, some of the scientist noticed the face and the first thing that came to there mind was that aliens did it. They started to go back and capture a picture of the face looking landform. Cyndonia became a priority for NASA when they arrived at the 'Red Planet' in September 1997.

They finnaly figured that it was just a regualr landform that had been created like face, not by aliens but by nature. The picture actually shows is the Martain equivlent of butte or mesa, those are landforms common around the American West. Scientist state that "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". Also he says ""Thats the lava dome that taks the form of isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars"".

The face on mars could have been crated by aliens though. Aliens cpuld have easily managed the curves and the ways the face looks, the nose, eyes, ears, mouth and the way it was even shaped looked like a alien head. It is very possible for it to be alins who have created this face, maybe it was a sign that aliens are here or asign that aliens know about humas.

Most landforms mostly get created about how the surroundings are or whos there. There is stuff called man made and thats made by human, but no ones ever heard of alien made. Since they used the better camera with better pixels and better HD, it turns out that the face looking lanform on Mars was just another weird looking landform, no aliens, just landform.

F854C455EFBC,"Twenty five years ago a weird picture showed up in the Jet Propulsion Lab by a NASA's Viking 2 spacecraft. It took a picture of what seemed to be a human head on planet Cydonia. People in the Jet Propulsion Lab were surprised at what they saw. Though many thought it was something formed by aliens, scientists figured it was only another Martian mesa. They said the shadows is what made it look like a face.

The shadows gave the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth, which made the Martian mesa look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Though it was said to be only a landscape on Cydonia, the news of the face went crazy. It starred in Hollywood films, appeared in books, magazines, and so on. Others thought that NASA would rather hide the true information of the face and just say it was the shadows which made us think it was a face.

Though, NASA defenders wish there was ancient civilization on Mars. On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture of the face, which came out ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The picture revealed a natural landform; no alien monument.

It's not easy to reach Cydonia and therefore makes it difficult to get a picture of the so called face. Garvin said that you could see if there were small objects on Mars, therefore no alien civilization is on Mars.

This shows how the face on Cydonia is not a face, but a landscape. The shadows in the picture made the landscape appear to have a face that look human. Therefore, there are no alien artifacts on Mars. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The Face was photographed with a high quality camera that could make images 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So if there were other objects created by aliens, you'd be able to see them. If the Face was really created by aliens, there should be more objects to prove that, and not just the Face.

The picture of the Face is very similar to the Middle Butte located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Garvin says it's about the same height as the Face on Mars, which shows that the Face is a natural landform like the Middle Butte.

When the picture of the Face was posted on a JPL web site, it revealed a natural landform. Many people believed there was no alien monument after all.

It was a humans head it was also formed by shadows, which made it seem like the huge rock formation had eyes, nose, and a mouth. But it was just an illusion. NASA knew that if they were to put the ""huge rock formation"" on Mars they would attract a lot of attention. The were right! As soon as the huge rock formation was on Mars that's when NASA started getting all the attention NASA knew was coming.

B0C80C0550D7,"In 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet of Mars, and it was taking new pictures for all of mankind to see. As it was passing over a strip of Mars called Cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. This new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. A few days later NASA reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit. Conspiracy theorist were fast to make speculations that this was ancient alien architecture or something of the sort. But NASA said that the face was just a geograghical coincidence, and there is no alien stucture on Mars.

One reason that consiracy theorist could beleive that this could be an alien stucture is that the resolution of the first picture was very low. In paragraph 10 it says,"" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the ""face on Mars"". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.

But even after these new pictures conspiracy theorist were still bent on the idea that NASA was trying to cover something up. In spite of the new pictures people said that the day the photo was taken, it was cloudy. Therefor the photos couldn't be very accurate. In fact, these theorists were right. The day the photo was taken was in winter. It says in paragraph 8 that, "" ... it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" These facts show that the landmass could indead be hidden by clouds. However, NASA still supported their claim that it was just a misinterpreted natural landform.

While NASA never spoke negatively about the theory, they set out again to prove it wrong. on April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came over the face on Mars, and it took photos with a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel; the highest ever yet. What these pictures showed was what would be a butte or a mesa on Earth. These landforms are very common in Cydonia, so the pictures were very realistic. With very high resolutioned photos, it is hard for conspiracy theorists to still say that there is face on Mars. It even says in paragraph 11,"" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

In conclusion, the face on mars is supported and not supported. NASA has proven with photographic evidence that it is just a natural occurance while conspiracy theorists say that it is a martian civilization. I think that NASA's facts are very believable, and they have the science to back up their claim. I hope that in the future, more people will base their beleifs off of science and not fictional conspiracy theories. ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

NASA has already created scientific technology for this reason. They would want to get the best looking picture and the most acccurate one.

NASA has been specifically designed to explore outer space and to discover what was there. They have been working even before 1976, Thats more than 40 years! They have only had a number of break throughs, proving that NASA would not hold back information about ancient civilizaions or alien lifeform because it would be a great breakthrough. The defenders of the NASA budget even wished there was an ancient civilization on mars. There was a degree of suprise for mission controllers at the Jet Propulsion Lab when the face appeared. They were fascinated by what they saw.

The alien conspiercy believers may reject the pictures and say they have been tampered with. NASA would not do that, however. They have already spent loads of money for this project and made all the equipment. They would not go through all that trouble just to lie to the public. NASA also took may pictures with their instruments from many angles and different views. They are high resolution photographs and they even have 3D alimetry, according to the article ""Unmasking the Face of Mars.""

Overall, NASA is an important space project that is honest and truthful about their work. They prove their claims with scientific facts and photos.

However, many years later, the Face turned out to be a natural formation, like a mesa is on Earth. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said that it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This proves that the Face is not an alien artifact. Also, NASA has found no other evidence of alien life on Mars, so the chances that the Face is made by aliens go down even more. Some people still believe that this Face has something do to with aliens. Conspiracy theorists say that NASA is hiding evidence from us, and that they don't want us to know about aliens on Mars. This theory is also disproved. Jim Garvin said that it's hard work to get photographs of the area, so why would NASA work so hard to get pictures of the Face if they wanted to hide it? Furthermore, NASA would love to find an ancient alien civilization, and would probably share it if they did find something. Finally, there is one more piece of evidence that the Face wasn't made by aliens. There are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face.

It took 18 long years to get to the bottom of this and it is simply just a natual landform. We are certain.

A few days after NASA sent Viking 1 to Mars to take pictures, they got back photos of a face. Not just any face, it was a human face. Not only is this crazy, it's impossible. It's impossible because we spent a lot of time and money reaserching if humans can go live on Mars. And it has been scientifcally proven by us that no human can live on Mars, so for that reason I don't know how that human face got there in the first place.

I know that some people think that maybe aliens are the ones who made the face, and you may be right. In some cases though, while we we'er reaserching, we would have noticed already. What we think it is is a natural landform. I know that it sounds crazy, but it is a possibility. It would make more sense if it was a natural landform.

If you can't decide if it's a face, aliens, or just a natural landform, then let me take some details from the article to support my idea. One detail is that when scientists found out about the figure, they knew that it was just another Martian mesa. They are common enough around Cydonia. When the pictures were released, it revealed a natural landform. It turns out that there was no alien monument after all.

Dou you believe me know? All of theses details add up to only one solution, which is that it was only a natural landform. I couldn't make this decision without proof, and now that I got it, I can prove to the world that there is nothing but a landform.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
01064A13A7F8,"Alien's have been a question many astronauts and people from all around the world have been wondering about for ages. But do they actually exsit? A few years ago NASA discovered what seemed to look like a face on Mar's surface. Many think that the so called ""Face"" was created by alien's. But others think it was just created by natural causes just like how some landforms are created on Earth. How do you think that the formation was created?

So far NASA hasn't discovered any alien markings or any other form of life on other planets. This is one of the reasons why the formation was created by natural causes and not by alien's. Just like on Earth we discover something new every day, such as new landforms and new natural resources. The formation couldn't of been formed by alien's because where did they get the tools to make it? If aliens exsited, i think we would have more evidence.

Alien's don't exsit becuase we would have found some evidence of diffrent life on diffrent planet's by now. If their are no aliens then their are no alien made objects on Mars. Alien's probably would have found a better communication rought then sending us weird landforms that dont have much meaning at all.

Why of all things would the aliens create a face? Even if aliens did exsit i don't think it is their goal in their life to scare us humans. They would probably make something more reasonable, like a house or something like a shelter.

Along with the formation there are also many landforms on earth that are similar. Such as the Grand Cannon and things like that. Think if the humans lived on Mars and we came to Earth and saw the Grand Cannon we would automatically think that there must be life here since there is no other way this could have been formed. Just as we believe there is life on Mars we would assume their is life here. Untill their is more evidence about alien's we should not believe that they exsit.

As it says in the artical ""What the picture actually shows is the Maritian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-landforms common around the American West.""

The face on Mars is fake because on the day the face was first seen, outside was verry foggy.

This means that the cameras would have to see through haze.

However some still thought that the face was made by aliens, even though it was winter and in bad wheather.

Then later we took a picture of the face on a clear day and didnt see a face.

This makes me think that there has never been a face on Mars

Another reason that I think that the face on Mars is fake is because the statue was to be aproxamently two miles long and maybe even longer.

This makes it seen unreasonably tall.

If the face were to be two miles tall then that would mean that many of the other rocks would be smaller, but they are not actually the surrounding rocks are much bigger.

My last reason that I think that there isnt a face is because our pictures arn't the best.

The cameras that took the original picture took 43 meters per pixel, and the camera that took the picture in 2001 made a pixel every 1.56 meters.

This leads to the fact that no face had ever been found on Mars.

Only the camera made it look like a face.

I think that the face on Mars is fake because on the day of the original photo the wheather was foggy and the camera had to see through the fog, I also think it is fake because the face was aproxamently 2 miles long which is a verry big rock, the last reason I think it is fake is because the pictures taken were verry bad camera and on lt had a little amount of pixles.

The fog made it nearly impossable for the camera to take a clear picture of the mountain on Mars.

The face was also suposed to be about two miles tall which means that this mould be a verry big rock, but the rock besides it is much bigger then it.

The old cameras that NASA owned were bad compared to what the more modern pictures were taken with.

In conclusion everyone now needs to know that the face found on the mountain is fake.                                        ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The Face is just formed by conveniently placed shadows. NASA wishes there was life on Mars becase they would benefit from it, so why would they try to cover up something that could get them a lot of popularity and money. Scientists researched this farther and released even better pictures proving it was just a landmass and not an alien artifact. People believe that the clouds could've covered up alien markings but that seems illogical because in 2001 they went back to the face and took more pictures with even higher resolution and found that there were no markings at all, meaning more evidence leaning towards the Face just being a natural landmass and not an alien artifact. It was just a mesa the whole time.

So there is a lot of evidence leading you to believe that the Face on Mars is merely just a natural landmass called a mesa, combined with shadows gives the mass a facelike texture.

A95720F65860,"Aliens vs. Knowledge

Twenty-five years before 2001, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft spotted a landform in the shape of a face on Mars's surface. This, after being released to the media, caused an uprising of speculations. Did aliens make this? Were there other beings on other planets? Are we not alone?

A famous scientist once said that we researched for other life on other planets because humans didn't want to be alone in this vast galaxy. He also said that it could cause either fear or excitement. The media wanted to grab the attention of the common people, and to do that they needed something extraordinary. The media spins the truth to benefit their needs. You can't believe everything they say because all they can do is gain by your speculation.

NASA hardly thought this was the work of aliens. They didn't want the people to think they were lying, they wanted to seek the truth. Even if they were hiding something, they could only ever lose everything for covering it up. More attention on the dying out NASA program would gain the support and money to fund them. So, on April 5, 1998, they sent another spacecraft to take pictures of the landform.

Not everyone thought the image that came up, the one of a landform, sufficed. They argued that it was probably too hazy and that the image wasn't a reliable resource. They said that the haze was blocking the alien markings.

Again, NASA sent another spacecraft in 2001 to take better pictures in different angles. The picture showed a landform much like a butte or mesa here on Earth. Some people stated that it was a conspiracy.

Mars has unique quirks like every planet. Here on earth we have natural landforms such as a mesa, and mountains, and rivers. Mars isn't much different.

Scientists have special catogories for classifying a planet, and Pluto did not meet those requirements. So, every planet has to have at least one thing in common with another. Just beacause Mars is a different planet, doesn't mean that it can't have landforms much like those on Earth.

To say that one planet has aliens because of a landform, is to say that we are aliens as well. Don't we have mountains? Yes, you might say, but it's because of tectonic plates pushing against each other. Science has taught us many things, so now we know something foreign to people back then.

Take Christopher Columbus as in example. Before he sailed the ocean, everyone thought that the earth was flat. After he disproved the theory, people saw the earth for what it was: a round, water planet. Another great example would be Galileo, who disproved the theory that Earth was the center of the galaxy and the sun and everything else rotated around it. People had to have curiosity, and the willpower to go on with these expeditions. After they disproved a theory, it made more sense, and the world around us just is. Now, we don't question on how the mountains were made. We don't question on why we have day and night.

We are more educated now, but there are still things we haven't learned. That's why people should have a more open mind about finding the truth. Once we find the truth, we'll move on to bigger things and so on and so on. This mystery is one which piques people's interest, but turning to myth and false facts isn't the way to go. Exploring and learning from new innovations is what makes scientists who they are. They took the time to go through the process of being a certified scientist. To say you are smarter than one is disrespectful towards them, saying all their hard work was worth nothing.

So, to summarize, aliens did not make the landform on Mars. It was a natural occurence that got blown up into bigger proportions because the media wanted to satisfy their own needs to get profit. NASA knows what they are saying, and we should respect their statements until we ,for sure, know ourselves that the statement is false.          ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

My co-worker tried to convince me that aliens put the Face on Mars. He told me that by the looks of the picture it looked as if it was an alien artifact. He then stated that you could barely tell from the picture what exactly it is.

I told him I thought it was a natural landform that either looks like a butte or a messa. I also stated that the picture actually shows a Martian that kinda looks like a butte or messa. I then stated that the picture reminds me somewhat of a Middle Butte in the Snake River of Idaho.

He sent Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team to snap a photo ten times as sharper as the last one. He then decided that I was right and that he was wrong because when the image first appeared on web surfers it revealed a natural landform.

I would disagree because aliens are not real and why would they just made a radom face into the ground. I would say that the land in that area is just deformed. I think that it is just Mother Nature, she put it like that, that spot is a natural landform.

People might think that aiens are real but that saying is just a myth that some people that are nerds will belive. I use to think they were real and then I figured out they weren't. If they was real then when people or NASA went to a planet or just into space, why didn't those people every see them? If they did exist why wouldn't people take pictures when they were in space of the aliens? Why don't aliens exist?

If aliens do exist do you think they would attack you if they saw you? I would think that aliens would be on earth. What would aliens be like if they were on earth? would the Earth still be the same if they was on Earth. Who would controll them if the did exist.

Would aliens be in a zoo, becuse they are a weird like creture/human. people should know that akiens aren't real becuase if they were they would be on earth and people would take pictures and other things.

We have all hear about this ""Face"" right ? , Well if you haven't Is really just a landform. The other Scientists has all of these people rallied up because they think that aliens are to exist. That cannot be possible because , if aliens existed then why are we just finding them? Wouldn't we already have proof of their existence ?

Then Again , there are all types of landforms on earth some man made and more of the natural kind , So basically what you guys are saying is that if we find landform that looks like something is automatically aliens ??? what about mount rushmore ? That is a man made structure not saying that the ""face"" is man made but its just not relevant to get all of this contrversy about something that we barely know about .

So Therefore, You guys really dont know what the structure is. none of us know what ""it"" really is , It might look like a face but aliens are just not relevant enough to believe that they actually did something of this nature. i personally do Not believe in aliens , well would you blame me ? We have been to the moon, we have had a rover on mars for years ! and what do we get? nothing , just a rocky surface . no aliens , no water , No life period.

Nevertheless, even though in paragraph 10 it says, ""that that put out The maximum camera resoulution and each pixel spans 1.56 meters thats still not giving us any proof . We have been on this ""Aliens Are Real"" Stuff for a while now , and we dont have nothing that proves it. Don't you guys think that we should just cut it all out the picture ? we are wasting money on absoutely NOTHING.

Finally , as I finish my statement I will just say that im'm not telling you guys to give up on your research , Not at all . but all I am saying is That If your gonna try and find these ""aliens"" of yours Atleast have some proof of their existance.

6B59BE6C5DF3,"The face is simply a landform that ended up looking as if it were a face. If it were to be an actual face, I'm positive that the texture of the rock face wouldn't feel like it is made of rock. The face would decay and what would be left would be nothing but bones. The odds of finding an Egyptian Pharaoh's head on Mars is highly unlikely, or if there's any odds of that even happening at all.

In paragraph one, it states that the face is nearly two miles from end to end. If this were to be an Egyptian Pharaoh's face, it would have to travel all the way from Earth to Mars. How would the face even be put into space in the ancient Egyptian time period? Again, highly unlikely that a face traveled millions of miles through space and appeared on the surface of Mars. Just looking at the picture below paragraph five makes me want to believe that the face is really a face rather than a natural landform. The significant detail and shape of the face is so human like that it's hard to believe that is was naturally created over time. For example, the Washington Monument was hand carved with pick axes and with the use of dynamite. The detail is much more significant than the Mar's face, but yet how nature created it, I don't know and I don't quite understand how this was done. Considering this is two miles big also makes me wonder if this did come from outer space; the face's impact of hitting the crust of Mar's would ruin the structure of the face. The thought also of the face being made by craters hitting the face also doesn't quite make any sense. Could NASA possibly have made this up? People at NASA are very intellectual as they could maybe trick the world into believing that the formation of a human face on Mar's really happened. The odds of it being a natural landform is hard to believe, but also the thought of aliens creating the face is also highly unlikely.

In paragraph two, it states that scientists figured out it was just another Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia, but somehow turned out looking as if it were an ancient Egyptian Pharoah's face. How this happened, nobody knows, but in my opinion, this is just a very odd coincidence. Maybe someone outside of Earth carved this? As people even have believed that aliens were the creators of the masterpiece. Nobody will ever know but it is sure that the face isn't an actual Pharaoh face like people hypothesized it was.

From reading the article, it seems as if NASA used the gossip about the face to try and make money off of the coincidential face that appeared on Mars. At the end of paragraph five, it states that, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Why might they wish there was an ancient civilzation on Mars? Simply so that NASA's discovery could make them millions of dollars. NASA bringing in the word alien is just dumb in the first place. Are you serious? We haven't even found one thing about aliens existing and you try and tell the public that aliens made this? NASA's purpose of the face in my opinion is for the money.

The idea that the face is bona fide evidence on Mars makes sense, maybe the people on Mars were giants with two miles wide faces? From only seeing pictures, there isn't evidence of anything, we can only state what we believed happened for a face to appear on the crust of Mars surface. As many people believe multiple different hypothesis, we need to do more research to see if there is any faces buried in Mars just like the one we discovered. More evidence that there is possibly life on Mars being similar to the face found would make people really believe that life outside of Earth is possible. We as people could believe that the face is really a Egyptian Pharaoh's face, or a natural landform created by either craters, erosion, or the face possibly being relocated and reaching Mars. As already being stated, we need more evidence of this being a real face. If this is really a face then there would have to be other pieces of the rest of the body somewhere, or more faces in Mars below the surface. The coincidence of a Pharaoh's face appearing on Mars is almost impossible, considering that Pharaohs were people that weren't exactly giants as a two mile wide head would demonstrate. Up close picutres of the face showing if there is possibly more detail than what is shown in the picutres provided would help the fact that this is actually an ancient Egyptian face. There is no way to prove this other than finding other evidence of faces so that this coincidence doesn't seem so much like a coincidence. Being created by aliens would be hard to prove, also using you're common sense that we have yet to find anything even close to the fact that aliens exist. We would first have to prove aliens are real, then somehow prove that aliens came to Mars, carved this face, then left without doing anything else. The chance of aliens carving out this face is also very highly unlikely, in my opinion there is no chance of aliens carving out a human face on Mars. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

This shows that many people had many questions and disbelief of what NASA had been telling the public. This proves that many people where arguing that NASA was not being truthful about what they have discovered. Therefore, people where getting angry with NASA.

NASA was telling the truth, it was just an landmark. Many citizens thought it was a sign of intellignece life, and didn't believe what NASA was telling them. NASA was excited about this discovery, and wanted everyone to know. They didn't hide anything, there still was not any prove of intelligence life on Mars. NASA was saying, that if they found intelligence life, they would tell the whole world. They wouldn't try to hide such a mind blowing discovery.

Even though NASA was telling the truth about everything they have discovered, and told the public that if they found life on Mars, they would tell the whole world, that isn't something they would hide. The public still wasn't convinced. NASA would love to discover life on Mars.

There are also many reaons for why it is just a natural landform that formed on Mars. It seems more likely that the face was not made by aliens, but formed naturally. Now here are just a few of the many reasons for why ""The Face on Mars"" is a natural landform.

The first reason for why aliens did not form the ""face"" is becuase aliens have not been proven to live on Mars. Which would make it impossible for them to have formed it. The second reaon is that life has not been proven to exsist on Mars, so it would have to be formed naturally. Finally, there are many landforms that are on Earth and may look like something else, and was naturally formed and not man made. For example, a cave in Tennessee has a lot of rock formations that look like bacon, a sun set, and even a frog. Those are just a few reasons for why the face on Mars was not made by aliens, but was naturally formed by nature.

The face on Mars has many differnt opinions for weather it was made by aliens or was naturally formed by nature. There are reasons for why either one of them could be proven correct.

We really cant believe something that has been supported by many facts and evidence. There are many reasons to why we should't believe that.

One of the three reasons is that according to the excerpt, scientists figured it was just another martian mesa,""common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an egyptian Pharaoh."" This shows that the figures were common around those areas but this one in particular had shadows which resembled an eyptian Pharaoh. Also, a few days after that NASA found out that the shadpows formed an illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth but we really can't trust this if it's a coincidence or actually true. Well that's when they're wrong thinking that it was created by aliens.

Accoring to paragraph seven, on April,5 1988, when mars global surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, a team snapped pictures ten times sharper than the ones the viking took. these pictures showed that the ""alien created"" landform was actually a natural one. The text supports this by showing that the they took way more sharper images which made them way more credible then the ones they took before because you could see the actual natural landform. Although he pictures were ten times sharper, there was still clouds which made the image hard to see making it not reliable.

Finally, the landform was a natural one for this reason. In paragraph 12, he text shows that ,""what the picture ctually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

To sum it all up, the article had a couple sources of evidence to support the fact that the Face was really just a natural landform.

Some people don't believe the Face on Mars is a natural landform. They believe that aliens created it. Some people also believe that it was not actually found on earth. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, has compared it to natural landforms on earth. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times better than the original photos taken by the Viking. It took a while, but Jim was able to prove it.

Jim Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" That is a natural landform found on earth. He also says, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" He says this because some people believe that it was not found on Mars.

The picture was taken by a space craft at a far away distance forming shadowing giving the ""illusion"" of a nose, eyes, and mouth.

First, the reason why the ""face"" is a natural landform is because on Earth you can compare a face in many objects around you.

Secondly, the reason why the ""face"" is just a natural landform is because the huge rock formation causes shadows. The shadows of the huge formation of rock can create the illusion of a face. The shadows can make it look like it has a nose, eyes, and mouth like structure in cases such as this one.

Lastly, the ""face"" on Mars is a natural landform because the photo was taken by a satelite. The pictures come in pixels meaning it could come out blury or unclear to clarify.

In paragraph 10 it staes that on April 5th 1998 a global surveyor flew over Cydonia with a camera 10 times sharper than the photo taken in the original 1976 picture, shown to prove that on this picture the closer up it looks less like a face. But this wasn't the end of the research.

The reaseach continues but with an even better camera to try and prove all of the conspiracy believing people wrong. In paragraph 11 it states that the new digital image taken in 2001, was a 3 times bigger sized camera from the 1998 photo, and it was sharper than ever. This image spans over 1.56 meters! If this ""face"" was made by aliens, then why were there no artifacts found around the photograph? The extremely high def. picture would have shown said artifacts. But there are still specticals believing otherwise.

The pictures are proven to be a natural born landform, pictures don't lie. Yes, maybe if we were ON Mars we would find some new facts to maybe prove one anothers views even more, but for right now NASA is winning. Conspiracy theories are theories. Picture evidence is pure fact shown to a persons face.

Just like the belief in wether or not earth and people were made by god or science. They're both theories that's why people have to have ""faith"" in what they believe. The Big Bang theory for example is a theory because it doesn't have enough evidence to be proven that it legitimately happened. It goes the same with religion.

In conclusion, people all have thir different beliefs. Some believe that the ""face"" was alien made, some believe it's natural born. But no matter what people believe, fact is fact. What would you believe, a conspiracy (something not officially proven) or a fact with picture evidence? ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
84CD770A3BA1,"The Face in Cydonia on Mars is merely a natural landform because if NASA has proof that The Face was created by aliens, the evidence would surely be shared with the world. Also, the Face is similar to several types of landforms on the Earth, and NASA has photographic evidence that the Face was not formed by aliens.

As mentioned in paragraph 5 of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" the Face has ""become a pop icon."" Because the Face has ""appeared in books, magazines, (and) radio talk shows,"" people have become brainwashed into believing that the Face on the planet Mars was created by alien forces. People claim that NASA is hiding the evidence revealing that the Face is actually made by aliens. However, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Not only would the proof of aliens bring in an abundance of excitement for Mars, but it would also gain NASA a great deal more of revenue. NASA

is not hiding any form of evidence towards alien-life on Mars, and the Face may not have anything special about it besides the fact that it looks ""like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

The Face on Mars is extremely similar to several landforms found on the Earth. As explained in paragraph 12, the Face is similar in design to ""a butte or mesa,"" which are ""landforms common around the American West."" Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, notes that the Face reminds him of ""'the Snake River Plain of Idaho.'"" In the Snake River Plain, there is a ""'lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face.'"" This is evidence to support that the Face is no different from any other natural landform, and that people have no reason for speculation against that idea. Another big reason to believe this claim is because professional scientists have pictures for evidence against aliens.

Scientists at NASA have photographic evidence against the claim that the Face is alien-made. People who claim that the Face was created by aliens will state that the photograph taken in April of 1998 was not enough proof of the Face being a natural landform. As stated in paragraph 8, the photographers ""had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face"" because ""it was winter."" This means that any proof of aliens could have easily been hidden by the haze covering Mars. So, in April 2001, a better picture was captured. In paragraph 10, it is mentioned that this time the photograph was taken on ""a cloudless summer day in Cydonia"" and that the evidence showed up with ""absolute maximum resolution."" This picture, in its high quality, proved that the Face truly was nothing more than a natural landform on Mars.

If NASA had any proof that aliens had caused the Face to appear, the evidence would surely be shared. The Face is close in size and design to a landform in Idaho, and NASA has photographic evidence that there are no signs of aliens anywher near Cydonia. Because of these reasons, one can clearly see that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

CC85026AA78A,"Was it aliens or was it a landform? Many people think that the face on Mars was created by aliens but there is a lot of evidence to support the fact that it is just a landform. For example, the fact that the Face looked like a rock formation, the use of a different camera to show every little detail, and the point that the picture actually shows the landform which is a butte or a mesa.

First off, when NASA first found the picture they unveiled the image to the public to catch their attention. The caption of the picture read ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This example shows that it looked like a human head but it was a rock formation.

Second, in paragraph eleven, the author says ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" Clearly this example proves that if aliens were the ones that created this face, their would be proof because with this camera you would be able too see any trace of anything that was there or footsteps of aliens.

Lastly, paragraph twelve states what the ""image"" was. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms commond around the American West."" This example says that what it was in reality was landform.

To end this arguemnt, right now in your head you might be thinking ""Pheraps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Well, that is why the NASA used a three times better camera to reassure the public of the landform.

In 1976 the Vikking took the picture that was bellived to look like a face. In 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over mars snapping pictuers that were ten times sharper than the first picture of then the first picture taken. By increaseing the sharpness of the picture it showed that it was a land form. The time of year that the first picture was taken it was a cloudy over the Red Planet. This could have made shadow that made the form look like it had eyes and nosie.

The last time the picture was taken (2001) the picture was taken in maximum resolution. This maximum photo if taken of earth you could see the pirimds in Egypt. So if there was anything weird the picture would have shown it.

In conclusion the picture taken in 2001 '' actually shows is the Martin eqivalent of a butte or mesa----landforms common around the American West.''(paragraph 12).

They have multiple pictures of the Face. They releasaed them to the public saying it was a landformation. If it wasn't they wouldn't have told the public. Also in the pictures you can see that it's not a face.

This shadowy face was discovered in 1976 when a NASA spacecraft was circling around the Red Planet. The photos that were taken of the shadows looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. The text states, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.""

2AD04D507843,"You may think that the Face was created by little green men who fly around in space ships, but all that is just conspiricy. As science tells us, and from what professional scientist have researched and studied at NASA, there is no life on Mars. Whether that life form be intellegent and macroscopic (visible to the naked eye) or bactireal and microscopic (only seen with a microscope). It is obvious to tell that the Face is merely an act of nature. For example, God's Thumb, a rock formation in the desert of New Mexico. The rock formation looks the way it does from centuries of erosion from wind, water, and sand. It is likely the Face has expirienced the a congruent form of events. It is also likely that the Face is a work of volcanic activity. Mars has a rich history of volcanic activiy. Mars just happens to be the home of the largest volcano in the entire solar system. From that information, it would be of no surprise to find the Face to explode in a giant fury of smoke, ash, and lava. Although, it would be an extraordinary happening to see. Going back to the previous point made erosion, apon closer inspection, you can clearly see trenches across the Face. These may very well be from liquid water flowing on the surface, wcich recent discoveries confirms. Also, around the foot of the Face, is a large gathering of rock, dust, and other debris from probabal erosion, evidence for such thing can most likely be found right in your own back yard. Say there is a small pile of dirt or a sand box your children plays in and builds a ""mountain"" as they would call it. Then after your children come inside, it rains. when the rain stops, you go out and check to see if the area is safe to play in for your children. As you inspect the area of play, you notice small trenches and wash-out around the base of the pile of sand.

Back at the controllers Jet Propulsion Lab the passage says that the face apeared on there monitors. It was a sensationto the lap and the scientist even thought it was shortly lived. Common around Cydonia they thought it was just anouther Martian mesa. After afewdays NASA unveiled the image of the face to the puplics eye.

14DB88AC2468,"The face on Mars can be explained many ways. Some ways may be that it was aliens. Some may say that it is just a unusual natural formation. There is no dought in my mind that it is a natural formation. There are many ways to explain that it is a natural formation.

First, here on earth we have many natural formations that stand out and have plenty of explanation behind it. One of them could be the dunes in the sahara. I am going to compare this to the face on Mars because wind can move sand, dirt, and dust. The wind could have shaped the pace on mars. Erotion could have played a big key in this too. The rock could have eroded from the dirt and sand rubbing against it. Even a metior from a long time ago could have shaped the face. Yes it is odd but if you see in the 19776 photo it is pretty well shaped so it had to be made by aleins around that time. Then look at the 2001 picture and it is eroded and not shaped like the other one. It is just a process planets go through and even earth goes through.

Secondly, the clouds and the camera could have made a little change in the look of it. It most likely is the camera from Viking 1. Nasa even said in paragraph 8 that they couldn't get a clean shot of it through the red clouds. Some may argue that with such an old camera how did Viking 1 get a really nice shot of it. Well that is a good point but it might have occured in that time era because it was in a nice condition to our pictures. Did you ever think though that it is just a rock that probably has alot of sand on it. Look at the 2001 picture, it is in an oval-square like shape. But look at the top of it. It looks like the wind has shaped dunes over the rock. And since the sand has moved it doesn't have the eyes and the perfect shape anymore. Viking 1 had a old type of camera on it. Today we have outstanding cameras and technology and we don't see the face anymore. Which one would you trust, the antique camera hundreds of millions of miles away, or next generation cameras?

Last but not least, it could be a rise in lava or underground material. Mars has the same inner layers as earth so don't you think it could be techtonic plate activity. An earthquake could cause an uprise in crust and rock. In paragraph 12 Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said that it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It could be a lava dome on Mars; however goes back to techtonic plate activity.

There alot of ifs, ands, or buts in this conversation. I am not saying that there was never life on Mars or there is no life in the universe but us, I am saying that it was most likely caused by natural causes. It could very well be that it was created by water or an ocean. The Mars face was created by natural causes.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
139B1A57D6A3,"In the article, I think that the image of the ""face"" on Mars is just a landform. The NASA workers think that that the face was created by aliens. I don't think it is so.

When it says in the article ""The camera on the board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" From the image they took, I don't see anything that has to do with aliens, and if they think the holes and landforms are made from aliens, well they are not because one aliens don't exist, and two holes can be their because of meteroids. Also how I think the face is a natural landform, the mount next to it doesn't look like a face. It just looks like a regular, normal landform, or it could of been from a meteroid that fell. If they think that aliens made those mount, they need to prove it with images of the rover going around Mars, because what they are saying about the holes and the ""face"" hasn't fased me one bit.

On the top image of the article, it shows the images throughout the years of 1976 (left), 1998 (middle), and 2001 (right). The first image of 1976 which was taken by Viking 1 does look like a face at first, but you never know, they probably used a camera that wasn't really good, and the image was blurry. I think that is why the landform looks like a face. The second image of 1998 which was taken by Viking 2 is a little more clear, but also still looks like a face, but it is starting to fade away, the nose, mouth, and eyes. The third image of 2001 which was taken by NASA does not look like a face at all. The landform has all kinds of cracks, and lines on the mount.

With the images, in the article is says ""Twenty Five years ago something funny happened around Mars."" So that was twenty five years ago when they took that photo, so that proves that in that time, they didn't have all kinds of cool techology to take photos that are really clear. Unlike in 2001, they had really good technology to take clear images to take a photo of the mount or whatever you think it is.

When they say that the aliens made the Face, you might not want to go with it because they might research it, but they also might assume what it is right away. And how they thought it was a face in 1976, they might of not had good technology in the 1900s. And they still believed it when they took the 2001 picture, and they even have good technology now. I don't know if they still believe it now, but if they do, that is suprising me.

When people put anything online about how they think it something, don't believe it until you see it yourselve. Either on the computer, or a book. But you don't have to go with what everyone is saying just because they think it is that, go look it up yourself, and if you don't think the image is compared to what they think the image is.

This big landmark could also be made by a big cannion or mountain that is in a direct shape of a face or just a bunch of trees could be gathered together to have a perfect form or shape of a face. In pargraph 12 it also talks about a plain which is a open area with alot of mountains.

Anways this all has an explinations other than aliens doing it. Also like there could have been a massive sand storm and the wind picked up really heavy and was throwing rocks and blew alot of sand and rocks and it could have created a face like object that you see when you look through a telascope at mars.

2440CD90B084,"I agree with NASA that the face was not made my aliens, and that it is a natural monument. My reasons are because the shadows are what makes it a face. Another reason is because you can really ress it unless there are shadows and your rihg tover it. My last reason is that Mars Global Surveyor Cyldonia took pictures of the Face and proved that it is natural.

The shadows give is it's face because there is bumps on mars, so that when shadows go a certain direction, it casts shadows and makes it look like a human face on Mars. In the article it says "" A few days late NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...whihc resembles a human head.. formed by shadows giving the illision of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The author reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and atrract attention to Mars."" This goes on to prove my next point.

Marc Global Surveyor Cyldonia has taken better picture of what they so call ""the Face"" on Mars.

It says

"" And so on April 5,1998, when Marz Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera(MOC) team snapped a picture tem time sharper than the original Viking photos. THousands of anxious web surfer were waiting when the image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" This goes to show that it was not formed by aliens and it was not created there on purpose.

My last reason is that you can really see it unless there is a shadow or you look at it at a exact angle. The article proved this by saying this "" Neerthe less, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enought for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degees to center the Face in the feild view,"" said Garvin. ""Malin's team caputred an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resoltion."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meter, compared to 43 meter per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This is proving that with a better camera and a better view that it was naturally made and you have to look at it from certain angles to see the face.

Yes, I agree with NASA that ""the Face"" is nothing but a natural landform, and not something created by life on a different planet. My reasons being the shadows are the only thing that gives it it's face, Mars Global Surveyor took better pictures of the landform, and you can't really see it unless you look from a certain agngle or direction. The momument is VERY natual in my eyes. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
92CB9173A201,"In 1976 NASA released a photo of a landform on Mars resembling a human face. Not everyone was easily convinced that it was only just a landmass though. Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, ""Bona fide evidence of life on Mars."" In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" the author, Garvin, believed that it was only a mesa. I agree with Garvin that this landmass was not an alien or proof of aliens whatsoever.

There is a large amount of proof in the article that was confirmed by NASA that this face is only a landmass, nothing more. In paragraph two of the article the author claimed that mesa's were ordinary in Cydonia, area the mesa was located, according to scientists. The only difference between this mesa and other mesa's found on Mars is that it had uncommon shadows over it illustrating eyes and a mouth. Since mesa's are common in this area it is very unlikely that this, ""face,"" was anything different than just an average mesa taken at an odd angle with a low quality camera.

The author also stated in paragraph seven that in 1998 that the photo was retaken with a higher quality camera. NASA released the photo onto a JPL website once the photo was confirmed and the only thing found was not an alien monument, but a natural landform. Many people still doubted that it was a mesa after this photo due to wispy clouds bluring the picture of the monument. According to paragraph ten in the article, the picture was taken one last time of the landmass revealing the same thing, an average mesa.

Mesa's also are found commonly in the american west as said in paragraph eleven. The mesa resembles the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho. The two mesa's share a similiar height, appearence, and were not alien monuments. People argue that the mesa in Ohio doesn't have a face appearing on the top, but the only reason the mesa on Mars has a face is due to the angle at which the picture was taken as I said earlier in my piece.

The two oppsing sides in this argument have evidence to argue their opinion. The belief that the mesa is actually a face is inncorect due to evidence in the article and my essay. Mesa's are common in the area the picture was taken and the face was caused by shadows along with a low quality camera. Whichever side you are on I believe I have brought forth enough evidence to change your opinion or strengthen your opionion that there was no alien lifeforms yet found on Mars.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The Face was not created by aliens it was actually just a rock that was shaped like a human face with a nose eyes and a mouth. A quote from the article that supports my answer of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens and the it was actually just a rock that was shaped like a human face with a nose, eyes and a mouth is ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" This quote supports my answer because it explains how NASA said that it was just a rock formation that resembled a human head. Another way of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens but was resembled a human head is it was also a natural landform and not an alien monument after all. A quote from the article that supports my answer of of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens but was resembled a human head is it was also a natural landform and not an alien monument after all is ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform.

This quote from the article supports my claim of how I know that the Face was not created by aliens but was resembled a human head is it was also a natural landform and not an alien monument after all because it explains how the rock formation was a natural landform after further reasearch was done and revealing to the world that the Face was not an alien monument after all. Finally, not everyone was satisfied so NASA did some more research and on April 8, 2001 they took a great photo of the Face and found that it was indeed a mesa. A quote from the article that supports my asnwer of how the Face was not created by aliens but was just a butte or natural landform is "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This quote supports my answer by explaining how the Face was not alien made and was just a natural landform.

In conclusion the Face was not alien made but was just a natural landform. The Face was not created by aliens it was actually just a rock that was shaped like a human face with a nose eyes and a mouth. The face was also a mesa, and new high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASAs Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is, a mesa.

159FA6D54C9B,"On May 24, 2001, NASA found something funny on Mars. The Viking 1 spacecraft was taking photos of possible landings sites for Viking 2. During that time, it spotted something that appeared to be an enormous head. It looked like an Egyptian pharoah, but turned out to be a regular, old mesa. It is still debated whether it was created by ancient Martian life, or whether is was just another regular landform on Mars.

My fellow co-workers and I thought this was incredible. We had just found something that could have proven ancient life on Mars. It turned out that it wasn't. Later, we figured out that it was another regular Martian mesa. We were so excited when we thought we had just found proof of earlier life on Mars. We thought we had just made one of the greatest scientific discoveries there has ever been. We were joyful when we saw the Face. We thought we found proof of ancient alien life without even looking for it.

Some people think that the mesa was actually created by aliens. In paragraph 5, it says that people thought NASA was just trying to hide all of the information. To be honest, we were hoping it was proof of alien life. We wanted to find proof of alien life. Why would we hide that information? That just doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

The Face is just a landform. In paragraph 2, it says that Marian mesas were common in the area the Face was in, Cydonia. Also, the shadows were the only things that made the Martian mesa look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. All that says is that a landform could be lucky and have some features that amde it resemble someone. Plus, how would Martians know what a Pharaoh looks like? They would be from Mars and not Earth. They most likely don't know anyone that even looks like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

In conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. It may look like a head, but that is just because of the unusual shadows that the mesa has. If my co-workers and I thought this was actually proof of alien life, why would we hide it from you? What is the point in hiding that kind of information? I'll leave you to decide that.

06368437F53F,"The believe of the ""Face on Mars"" being created by aliens is unlogical. The ""face"" is a simple landform. Why would NASA not tell the people there is aliens? There are images to prove that it's nothing but a natural landform.

First, NASA would make tons of money if there was aliens. The ""Face on Mars"" has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and even radio talk shows. They would make tons of money to be the first space station to find logical information to show that aliens exist; they would go down in history. However, NASA is an informative group; they can't send out false information. That is why they aren't releaseing any information; there is nothing to release.

Second, on April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time the MOC team took pictures, pictures that were ten times better than the original. When the team uploaded it online the image revealed nothing but a normal, natural landform. That day was cloudy however so any type of alien finding could have been hidden in the haze.

However people still weren't satisfied, so another image was taken on April 8, 2001, on a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. Which showed nothing again; Garvin stated, ""...you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size,"" and, ""So, if there were objects in this picture...you could see what they were!"". Which means that they enlarged the picture and there was nothing there.

In conclusion, one should not believe there is any alien activity to do with the ""Face on Mars"". NASA would get money off having found the first aliens, yet they aren't revealing anything, because there is nothing to reveal. There have been two pictures to prove there is no alien findings on the ""Face on Mars"". The ""Face on Mars"" isn't some alien creation; it's a simple natural landform.

984825A9FE9F,"Twenty-five years ago, NASA found what looked like a human face on the planet of Mars. Early in the discovery, scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. A few days later, NASA presented the image to the public. The picture definitely attracted attention to Mars, which is what NASA wanted. Soon after, the public was let down being told it was just a natural landform and that it wasn't an alien landform after all. However, some people would beg to differ.

There is always possibilities about aliens and what they do in space, but this is not one of them. The face is nothing but a natural landform. On April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look at the face. The text states that Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo with the camera's absolute maximum resolution. Each pixel in the image spans 1.56 meters. This proved that all this landform was was something similar to a butte or mesa which is common around the American West. Garvin states, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Overall, these two landforms are about the same.

Along with the picture of the face, if anything else was on Mars, we would've seen them with the high quality image. The text stated, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" If any sign of martians was on Mars, we would've been able to see it. Objects such as airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks would have been able to be identified.

Although, martians could still possibly be out in our universe, this face on Mars will not prove that. Many would like to believe this is a martian mesa but it is nothing but a natural landform.

FD96B26E06F8,"False Face on Mars

For some decades people have been spark with the idea of an acient civilization/aliens on Mars for a while due to Viking 1 capturing a picture of what seem to be a face on Mars. Hollywood movies, commercial, comics, and etc commercial things have fill the minds of many people with flase accusation. The saying of don't always beleive what you see or hear is true in this situation. There are many reason why this information is false. And I as a scientist at NASA will give you reason and facts on why it is flase.

The truth is there is no face on Mars. If there were face on Mars there would be many more sign of life and ancient artifact or buildings from ages ago. Just like in Earth there were many sign leading to ancient civilization such as the Inca, Maya, Aztec, and Egytian. This civilization had proof such as ruins, artifact, and fossil leading to it, but there weren't any sign of any of those in Mars instead there was just an asume face . As one can see here with just an asume face on Mars so it was unlikely that an aliens/other being did it.

A person might claim that scientists could be hiding fact from people so they don't find out the truth about the face like an alien actually making the face. I as a scientist would have already known report or leaked if some scientist were hiding something. Scientist love to share facts or truth, it is their second nature. And it is our responsibility to tell you guys about new fascinating discover we made not hide it. And this proof that is it would be pointless for scientist to hide the truths from people.

One of the most vauble reason is that the picture was taken in the 1900s. At the time the camera qualities and technowlogy weren't as advance as nowdays. The article state that there were three perfect shot of the picture taken one from 1976, 1998, and 2001. there is abig difference in each of these shot. In the 1976 picture it show a picture of what seem to be a face but later on in the 1998 picture it show a disoriented face or landform. Then in the last picture in 2001 it show a martian or a natural landform such as one that is in Earth. The qualities in these has much difference as the 2001 one being the most advance. The face also was effect by shadow from Mars, as state in the article that the dark color for the eys and nose plus mouth of the face image was cause by shadow from an angle in Mars due to the camera not being able to take a perfect angle of the martian. And all these fact are poiting out that the face on Mars is a false information.

With information scientist have been gathering and finding an alien being or an acient civilization on Mars is a dead end. The media is have a great effect on the people minds leading them to not see the truth that the face on Mars is a very false idea coming from the people minds, Now that the facts has been out to public people are agreeing with the scientist more and more. Thus all these facts and research from scientists leading to that the Face on Mars is FALSE but just a martian landform.                 ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Well on my opinion I don't think the face is a natural landform, in the text it states- twenty five years ago something funny happened around Mars. If the face has been apart of Mars for ONLY twenty five years I don't think is was apart of martian life, it would've already been discovered a long time ago. I honestly think it has been made up by an illusion.

Stated in paragraph three, NASA uveiled the image for all to see, it was a huge rock formation, which resmebled an humans head making out the shaped of nose, eyes, and mouth. They thought reasoning this situation of Mars would be a great way to grab the public's attention to Mars. It did.

Ever since then it has became an pop icon, so now that i think about it, It does'nt seem like it was apart of martian life. They so far haven't even caught real martian life on planet Mars. So I don't even know how to think that NASA could determine it was apart of alien life on Mars. It possibly could be but I don't think anything could live on the surface of that COLD planet.

It puzzles me that it just randomly popped up out of nowhere and has been located at that very spot for twenty five years, why could this happen now? I don't know maybe later in discovery the scientists of NASA will find out what and why this happened. NASA's budget wished there was an ancient civilization on Mars. I guess we'll have to find out later in the future.

How could they possibly determine it's real? Let's make a couple guesses.

The ""Face on Mars"" has been starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, articles, magazines, radio talk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines!

What was brought up was that back in the 70's, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2, it spotted a shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles away from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a top region of the Red Planet called Cydonia. The person who said this out loud said it was just formations called butte or mesa's which are very common around the American West. What happened was pretty normal at NASA. One of my co workers blurted out it was probably created by aliens. More people started agreeing with him because how else could a human looking face get on a planet that nobody ever talked about. It started to have me thinking about space and all the crazy things that happen, so I decided to do some research when I got home. I looked around the internet, and went to the public library to look for some books about rock formatons on different planets. Once I got those, I finally began research and what I found was shocking. I believe that the face on Mars is not and ancient alein artifact because rock formations form on every planet, pictures can be deceving, and there is no scientific proof that aliens have ever existed.

I believe that the face found on Mars is not an ancient alien artifact because rock formations form on every planet. research has shown that the face found on Mars looksv like lanforms common around the American West. As far as people know, that face could have just gotten there from some sort of sand storm on the big red planet back in the 70's. Another thing that people shold know is that pictures can be deceving.

I believe that the face found on Mars was not an ancient alien artifact because pictures can be deciving. What scientist knew back then, and what they know now is a lot different. There is much more technological advances now then there were back then, so the picture quality from space wasn't very good. It was very pixelated, not clear, and didn't give very much information. It is understandable that people thought it was an alien head but thats just not the truth. The picture quality now is at the highest its ever been so people can see pictures a lot more clearly. Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. That proves that the image was very deceving and not many people could figure out what it most likely looked like. One more thing that people should really know is that there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed.

I believe that the face on Mars was not an anciet alien artifact because there is no scientific proof that aliens ever existed. Back in the 70's people thought that aliens were real because the technology wasn't very good, and people olny believed what they were told.

The Cydonia mesa was created though natural means and there were cerntainly no aliens involved.

Some people might say that NASA would want to cover the mesa up if it was created by aliens, which make no economic sense. If extra-terrestrial life was found, NASA would get sizeable grants from the goverment to continue with the space exploration program. NASA decribed this as a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth"". There was no mention of aliens.

Better camreas, better crews, and everyone was trying to figure out this strange land mass. This was hard, because it takes a long time to line up a camera perfectly with an orbiting, spinning planet.

619425D74CE9,"The Face, a discovery on Mars. It was dicovered on 1976 and it was complicated to predict what it actually was. It was explored when NASA's Viking 1 was snapping photos of possible land places for the ship Viking 2.

When it was revealed to be a natural landform, not everyone was happy with it. The Face should be considered a natural landform.

I claim that it's a natural landform because it can be found on this earth. It wouldn't be a natural landform if it was not possible to find it anywhere. To confirmed it's identity, Mars global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997 after 18 years of the discovery. Jim Garvin, chief scientist of NASA's MGS stated, ""We felt is was important to taxpayers. We photographed the Face as soon as could get a good shot at it."" This senteces here shows how important is was to identify the Face.

On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture that is ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. After they snapped photos of the Face, it was later revealed to be a natural landform. There was no alien monument after taking a look at the pictures. According to the text, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"" (Unmasking the Face on Mars,7). Many people disagreed that is wasn't a natural landform, but an alien.

The camera used to take the picture wasn't an ordinary camera. It was the aboslute best camera at that time and it zoom in three times bigger than the pixel size. Some might argue that it could be hidden by a haze or mistaken, but it was looked over for the second time and it was confirmed to be a natural landform twice. If you were to use the camera that they used, you can identify any objects such as an airplane or Eygpt pyramid on Mars.

Overall, the Face is a natural landform. The landform is common around American West. Garvin stated, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" It's comparing a real landform to the Face. The Face today can be considered a natural landform.              ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
160363090A39,"In 1976 the first image of ""The Face on Mars"" was captured. NASA's Viking 1 was circling the planet when it spotted the likeness of a human face. Nearly two miles from end to end the face was from a region called Cydonia. Scientists figured it was just another mesa, landforms common in this area. When NASA released the picture to the public it became a pop icon. Some people think the Face is evidence of life on Mars, however, NASA disagrees.

Conspiracy theorists feel that the Face's true reason for existence is something that NASA would rather hide. In the mean time NASA's budget defenders wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Finding such a thing would greatly benefit NASA and hel them in many ways. Therefore, if the Face really was proof of life on Mars, NASA wouldn't be hiding it, they would be announcing it for their own good.

On April 5,1998, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped another picture ten times sharper than the original photos. The new image first appeared on the JPL web site, revealing that the Face was in fact a natural landform, not an acient alien civilization. However, conspiracy theorists were still not satisfied due to the fact that it was a cloudy time of the year on Mars. NASA prepared to look again and captured a final picture on April 8,2001. What the pictured shows is a mesa, landforms common around the American West.

Of the three images NASA snapped of the Face, none of them show any alien monuments or civilizations. The increased pixel sizes would have picked up any objects on the ground such as pyramids or planes. There is no reason for NASA to believe they discovered anything other than a common natural landform. The only difference is that this landform has unusual shadows that make it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.         ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
CD9DA2DD4B40,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" the author writes about a mesa on the surface of the planet Mars. This particular mesa recieved a lot of attention because the shadows resmbled a human face. Many conspiracy theorist believe this means there is alien life on Mars, but they are incorrect. The ""Face"" on Mars in simply an ordinary mesa.

The original picture of the ""Face"" was captured in 1976. Since that time ouR camera have improved, allowing us to see images more clearly. The original image was blurry and indistinct, leading may people to believe that the mesa was evidence of alien life on Mars. Again when the second picture was taken in 1998 camera were improving, but not as efficient as the camera used to take the final picture. Also in 1998 the picture was taken on a cloudy day, obscuring the mesa behind clouds. The 2001 picture clearly shows an ordianry Martian mesa, not a ""Face"".

""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size so, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks you could see what they were!""(Garvin, Mars global surveyor). If there was any sign of alien life, activity, or even past activity NASA would be able to see it in the 2001 picture of the ""Face"". However the picture clearly shows an empty mesa. This

Martian mesa can even be compared to an ordianry Earth mesa!

This mesa attracted a lot of attention from the media because of the way the shadows fell across the mesa, creating a face-like illusion. NASA captioned the original photo ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The authors wanted to engage the public and they definetly did! While many people believed the shadows created the image of a face, NASA clearly stated in the original caption of the 1976 photograph that it was simply an illusion caused by the shadows.

The ""Face"" is not really a face at all. It is a huge rock formation/mesa, similar to many other mesas on Mars. The only thing that made this particular mesa any different from every other mesa on the surface of Mars was the coincedincial way the shadows fell across it. Many people thought this ""Face"" was evidence of life on the surface of Mars, but the are wrong. This is because the picture would show signs of life or activity, but there were none. So, in conclusion the ""Face"" is not and never was an ancient alien monument.        ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

F57B42D73FEA,"There could be many explanations for this mystircal face, although, the face could have just been created by the planet when formed, or it could have been made by something unexplainable. How do you think the face was formed?

The face is more than likely just another natural land form, just like here on earth, we have natural land forms that look like living animals or plants. The likely hood of the face being unatural is very slim. Being that the face had not changed for 25 years, it could mean that this is just a land form that has existed since the planets beginning.

The face is similar to a natural land form here on Earth, in the Snake River Plane of Idaho. The face shows that it is possible for it to be anything, it could be alien made, but it is highly unlikely. There has not really been any true evidence that aliens exist.

Skeptics may believe that the face could be more proof that aliens exist in outer space. Which could very well be, but there is still no strong evidence that it is true, we could be the only living planet in space.

Concluding the face is extremely likely to be just a natural formation that the planet had when it was developing. There is also no completely proof that it is alien proof, and making a face on a planet would not be the best way to comunicate with humans.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
3CA7F8405934,"The ""Face of Mars"" was not created by aliens. The ""face"" is a mesa, an elevated piece of land similar to a plateau. The mesa is about 2 miles long, and the face is created by the shadows from protruding rock. The features of this landform could have been created by aliens if they had the ability to carve a two mile long mesa to look like a face, not knowing what it looked like while they were carving it. Since they were on the ground they we we carving, they would have had to either cut into the rock blindly, or have a method to see what the face looked like. That method, be it mechanical or optical should still be visible. The aliens might not be humanoid, and might not know what a human face looked like. They wouldn't be able to cut out an image of something if they don't know what it looks like. Even if aliens could cut a face into the rock, there would be fragments of that rock lying all around the base of the landform. Most of the debris might be swept away over time, but there would still be some. If the carving was done by aliens, they would have to have some way to get on top of the mesa, and that might be visible. It could be stairs, or a ladder, or a rope, but it should be visible to the satellite pictures. If the aliens did cut the face into the mesa, then it they would have gone about it in a different way. Assuming that the aliens created the face is assuming that they are intelligent beings. Intelligent beings would most likely have created finer details or carved a symbol or word to show who created the face. If they are unintelligent beings, how did they get on top of the mesa and how did they cut out the face.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

It became a pop icon and starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows. Everyone believed this was evidence for life on Mars. But that was shut down after another picture was taken of the Face that didn't quite look like a face at all.

On April 5, 1998 Michael Maling and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took a trip to Cydonia for the first time. There, they were able to snap a more clear and sharper picture of the Face than the original photos. After looking at it, the picture didn't show a face. It just showed a natural landform.

Although, the picture was proof that it was just a normal landform, not everyone was satisified. The Face on Mars is found at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. It was a cloudy time of the year on the Red Planet and the camera used to take the photo had to peer through the clouds to view the Face. Some skeptics said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by the haze of the clouds.

The mission controllers were prepared for a second look. On April 8, 2001, a cloudless day in Cydonia, the Mars Global Surveyor went to find the Face. What the picture showed was the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. Which are landforms common in the American West.

In conclusion, the Face was not made by aliens. The Face has nothing to do with aliens and wasn't made or created by them. The Face isn't The sharper pictures taken in 1998 and 2001 show proof that the Face is actually just a natural landform.      ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Scientist believe the face wwas just another Martian mesa, which was common enough around Cydonia.

Scientist also took photos called viking photos of this face in 1976, 1998, and 2001. With new high-resolution images and 3D altiemetryfrom NASA's mars global survey spacecrafts reveal the face on mars for what it really is a mesa.

People at NASA wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars but facts show that the face was just part of the Earth's geography. For instance people believe that the aliens built the face to show they are living, but one camera team took a picture ten times sharper then the original viking photos. MAny people were waiting for the results and the results showed that it was just a natural land form and not an alien creature after all.

Not everyone was satisfied with the photos, this was because the face was located in a place where it was a cloudy time of year. people believed that under the wispy clouds they would find alien life. so on a cloudless sumer day they took another photo to show there was no sign of alien life. After taking the photo and observing it evidence showed that there was no sign of alien life.

Some of NASA would try to believe that there must be alien life on Mars but they could not find evidence to prove their point.

This article states that the Face is,""formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This illusion is what conspiracy theorists use to make it viral. It also proves how there is no face at all. It is all just a big shadow of a mesa in Cydonia.

There is plenty of evidence that can prove there isn't anything wrong with the area in Cydonia. Going from high defintion photographs with modern technology to zoom in and spot out evidence or old photos showing shadows of the mesa walls.

NASA has figured out that it's just a natural landform on Mars and nothing else. NASA haven't explored all of Mars and can state it's an alien creation, there might be more than just one and they all could be natural landforms. It might look like a really weird face from above, but NASA has already stated that it's a natural landform.

NASA has explored a lot of Mars, but not enough information to say it's an alien creation. They've just found one and it looks pretty like a huge face to some people. They might find more out there just like this and it's still and ordinary landform. On Earth there are a lot of these landforms around the American West. NASA has taken a picture in really high-quality camera to show that it's just a natural lanform there.

Before Amercia had these great cameras and computers, they weren't able to get a clear picture of the face. So people just assumed that it was an alien creation/monument. If they say it is where are the facts that say it's an alien monument. Later after all those years, NASA were able to take a maxium resolution picture and post it to the world. Thousands of people were waiting to see the photo, but when they did it was just a natural landform. There was no alien creation to see and observe at.

Although NASA has said it's just a natural landform, people state that sometimes NASA doesn't want us to know certain things. Some people say it could've been a monument created by an alien civilization on Mars. They haven't gone through all of Mars and know that was there or not.

If this was evidence of life on Mars it would have been a great benefit to NASA.

When NASA unvieled the photos of the ""face"" on Mars critics believed that this was proof of life on Mars and that NASA would want to hide this information.

Defenders claimed that this theory was invalid because life of Mars would benefit NASA, so why would they try to hide it? To further their claim that the ""face"" didn't prove life on Mars NASA decied to take more HD pictures of the landform.

In 1998, NASA took picture of the face that were easier to see and 10x sharper than the originals. After these pictures were relased people still weren't satisfied and said that alien markings could've been hidden by the wispy clouds. Mission cotrollers said ""It's not easy to target Cydonia""...

It just takes time to figure out whats going on, on the moon. And figure out that something has to doing this and make it look like us people/scientist at NASA look crazy. By saying that there's a FACE on the moon. Who wants to believe that soemone has made a FACE on the moon by these past years. But I know we people/scientist of NASA will figure out what it might be causing these marks/ FACE's on the moon. And no one can say anything about whats happening beacuse they don't know the truth and how do we know or donn't know that if someone is trying to make us look stupid and make it look like something or someone has been on that moon marking it?

One of the things is that I'm still kinda confused on is how or what could of done this and why? Why would somebody or something do this to our moon? And if they did it to our moon to just mess around and make fun of us for thinking that it was something real or ""ALIENS"" that I don't believe in for some reason. But i just don't think it could be aliens beacuse they are not real. Plus I've seen a real and real evidence from the internet or anywhere else and there's no proof.

And another reason why I think that it couldn't be anything alive is that they couldn't survive a ""second"" out in space. And maybe it could've been the moon itself. What I mean by that is that the moon can just form it itself and created just a peron FACE or just have been something else that no one could or would ever identify. Even if they try so hard to do. It still wouldn't work. Maybe it's just how the landform just creates in space. Like maybe the other plantes have something in coomon and do the same thing but no one could ever notice.",1,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
F56337A0A795,"I think that the Face is just a natural landform. Just like landforms form on Earth, landforms can form on Mars. Why I say it's just a landform is because, it's just a huge rock formation,it isn't an alien monument, and Garvin says that you could show a picture 3 times bigger with every object shown in the picture.

First,the Face is just a huge rock formation. Mars is a rocky planet. Rocks can form any shape they aren't created by humans. There isn't any sign of life on mars so no one could go there and make a face on Mars' surface.

Second, it isn't an alien monument. An alien wouldn't make a human face just for fun. In plus, they wouldn't even know what humans looked like. They wouldn't even know how to get to earth to see what we even look like. So trust me aliens are not real!

Third, Garvin says that you could show a picture 3 times bigger with every object showing in the picture. This could prove that there isn't anyone or anything on mars that could've made the face. This could prove almost anything in any picture of the Face.

In conclusion, I believe that the Face is just a natural landform. It's just a huge rock formation, it isn't a alien monument, and Garvin says that you could show a picture 3 times bigger with every object in the picture showing.               ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
BAC9D40F54C9,"Contrary to popular belief, the Face on Mars is not a face, but a natural landform on the surface of Mars. Now, this may be hard to agree with, but the Face is actualy a structure similar to a butte or a mesa, a semi-flat landform common in the American west. It should also be noted that the area around Cydonia (a region on Mars on which the Face is located on,) is extremely cloudy around the time the pictures were taken by the Viking 1 in 1976. Also, Cydonia has many other mesa-like structures that are quite common in the area. The manner in which the Face was formed is unknown, but many scientists belive that shadows formed from outcrops in the area created the illusion of the eyes, the nose, and the mouth on the structure, giving it it's facelike apperence. There were three diffrent gruops of photographs taken of this structure. The first was taken by the aformentioned Viking 1, in 1976. The second was taken on April First, 1998, by The Mars Global Surveyer. The last one was taken in April of 2001, again by the Mars Global Surveyer. If this was a face, would'nt all three pictures be the same, insted of the last two being clear eveidence that the Face isen't a face at all, but rather a naturaly forming landmass? So, in conclusion, there is a scientific explanation to just why and how this strange and peculuar structure came to be.

97A158DCC4BF,One day in the lab two people were arguing over the face of the natural landform. Tthe one said spacecraft normally looks straight down. Alien markings were hidden by a haze. A surveyor is a mapping spacecraft that normally looks straight down. mars golobal surveyor drew close enough for a second look. The face on mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude were it was winter in april 98 a cloudy time of year on the red planet. The camera on board had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. malin team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution. As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size he added.

011433B18B2F,"I am a scientist and I belivie that the Face on mars wasn't created by an alien. Looking at pictures I can see that the Face dosen't look like a human at all. In 1976 the Face was funny looking and later on in the years the Face blured out. It looks like a natural landform because people think just because it has eyes and a nose.

According to the arictle states the scientist belived the Face was an alien artifact. But I think how would you that it's an alien the world has so many different fetures, and creatures everywhere you may never know. Even though know ones probaly every seen an alien before. It may have been the shape or form they way the ground grew, and it just turn out to look like a face.

Then the found out on April 5,1998 that Micheal Mailn snapped a picture ten times finding out it was just a natural landform. I wounder why they thought that it was an alien. They got a camera on board to see if another may have poped up scientist checking it. If they would find one then it would be proof ,because now they have a camera on board to see.

I think that the rule of thumb is great because you can't discren things in to image 3 times bigger. It may look like something that it's not and apper wrong to look like an creature. What the picture actually shows is Martian equivalent butte and it and the Amercian West landforms are both in comman. It's a lava dome that takes form of a islated mesa looking ,and having same hieght of the Face on Mars.

I think that you shouldn't asume that something or someone is what it isn't. You always get facts and debate and reason more. And find out if your reascreah may have been wrong going thur the process. There mistake in the long run was making the image bigger than what it is was.

03387B47D65F,"The Face of Mars

What if the Face on Mars was actually created by aliens? How would have the world reacted? Well we wouldn't know. The face on mars is actually a mesa that happens to be shaped like a face. We know that the face on mars was not created by aliens because there are no signs of life, as far as NASA knows there is no life on mars, the Face of mars is just a mesa, but if the Face was created by aliens we would be able to see symbols and signs but all you can see are just small vallys and ridges. Aliens did not build the face on mars.

As far as we know there is no visible life on mars. The reason for this is because mars is inhabitable. The conditions are mars are to harsh for any living organism to be able to live. There have been many expiditons by rovers that have roamed the red planet for years and still have not seen any forms of life. The author states, ""There was no alien monument after all."" With all this it would be almost impossible for a life form to be able to live on Mars.

Eventhough there is no visible life on Mars there has never been a sign of life ever being on Mars. Again with all the probes and missions to Mars there has never been a one-hundred percent fact that there has been life on Mars. The Mars rovers have taken over 100 samples and still have found no signs of life ever being on the planet. When the author quotes Jim Garvin, We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. The reason for this is because the planet has no life on it and if the only exciting thing that the scientists at nasa could find was just a mesa that looks like a face.

All in all this is not a creation made by aliens it is a mesa on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has released facts about why this wonder of mars is just a normal natural landform. Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001a cloudless summer day in CydoniaMars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, said Garvin."", the author also gives us this peice of information, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" With this all being said with the high resoloution picture and the quote from the scientist at NASA you can say for sure the Face is a natural land form.

Although some people might say this is not a natural land form. They might say that it is a alien artifact left by some martians or some garbage like that. Some people dont under stand that crazy land forms canjus occur naturaly. The author gives the reader a wonderful example of this on our own planet, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. So if we on earth believe that the mesas in the American West can be made by the earth doing what it does why cant Mars make its own land forms.

The face of mars is just a natural land form in one of Mars's mesas. There are no signs of life on mars, There have never been any signs of life on mars, and the Face of mars is just a cool looking formation made by a mesa biome.

The position of the planet can also be the reason why the rock looks like a face. In paragraph 2, it says that the rock did have shadoes that could give anillusion of eyes, mouth, and a nose. In paragraph 8, It gives the season which caused clouds. Clouds are one of many reasons that causes shadows. These clouds could of ben in a cerrtain position that gave ""The Face"" illusions.

A possible explanation that the face is just a natural landform is erosion. In paragraph 8, it states that . Mars experienced a vey cloudy time. As known that clouds can form rain and/or wind which can be used to wither ddown rocks. Wind on Mars could be harsh and putting a lot of pressure aganst a giant rock causeing it to make indents. These indents can be seen as eyes, mouth, or even a nose.

As you see in the pictures that were taken by Viking 1, over the time period the face began to dissapear. In the pre-story,

""The Face"" was hand made by an alien then wouldn't you think that they would keep itin good condition . Instead ""The Face""

There are many factors that can be said to prove that ""The Face"" is just a natural landform.

0FF1B6CC8442,"Do you believe in aliens or life on other planets? A face shape was found on Mars and many are calling it an alien marking. It is proven that it is not from aliens through research and pictures, however people still continue to protest. Our scientists at NASA have already studied the mark as soon as it was spotted. Also, if the so called ""face marking"" was from aliens, NASA would be all over it.

First of all, the scientists at NASA have already studied and observed the marking as soon as we were notified and pictures were sent to us. Later, finding out that it turned out to be nothing more than a natural made landform. The quote, ""scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia"" (2) shows how we found out really what it was. The quote, ""a few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see"" (3) shows how NASA was sharing with the people the truth behind what the marking was. We wished we could have been able to do more research on aliens, but that was only capable if the life on Mars were real.

Lastly, if there were real aliens, we would be open about it and do research immediately. The quote, ""defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars"" (5) shows how we wish that the aliens did exist so we could learn more about life on Mars. The quote ""but the sensation was short lived"" (2) shows how we were sad that the landmark wasn't alien made. We would have liked it if we would have been able to research the landmark about aliens but unfortunatly it wasn't caused by aliens. If the marking was real, we have been proud to announce that and would have not keepen it a secret.

Others might argue that our team at NASA are lying to the public but that is not true. They say that we are hiding the information from the public. The quote, ""some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars"" (5) shows how other people have different thoughts on what we found. Another quote, ""NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists"" (5) shows how people begin to believe and think that we're lying to them about our discovey. However, Our scientists would be thrilled if it really was aliens, starting ancient civilization on Mars.

Some believe that the marking on Mars was an alien marking. We, scientists, have proof that it was not. We have done plenty of research as proof to our conclusion. If the mark was real, NASA would have already discovered all sorts of information on life on Mars.

23A2D8E5F8EF,"The ""Face of Mars"" isn't really a face. It only looks like one. It's because of the land and the shadows it gets, from different angles. It may look more like a face at other angles, and it also maybe just looks like a big blob of land. So it's not a face. Also if anyone was able to create that it'd be impossible because no human being could live there. There's no oxygen there. So it'd be impossible if someone created that, there on the planet Mars.

Yes, when they did first discover the ""Face on Mars"" everyone thought it was a face on Mars, but over the years it became a whole lot easier to see. At first the photo taken in 1976, was a very blurry picture, not high quality on that first one. Then the second one, taken in 1998, it sort of still looked like a face, but not as much as the first photo. Then the last one taken in 2001, you could see and tell that it wasn't a face. It was just the way you would look at it. At different angles. So it is really all your say, not mine.

It only looks like a face because of the shadows and the landform. The huge rock formation has given everyone the illusion of it having eyes, nose and a mouth. When none of that stuff is really there, in the first place It just looks like it's there, but in reality it's not. Nothing is there except for rock formations and a whole bunch of different landforms. There's also one weird and unusual shadow that made the rock formation look something like an Egyptain Pharaoh.

It just all depends on if you still think it looks like a face. It's all your opinion, not mine. Ihave no say in what you think it looks like. We don't see everything in the same way, no one does. So if you think it looks a face still then to you it's a face. But to me it's just some landform that looked a lot like a face when the first photo that was taken in 1976, it looked a lot like a face. But then over the years we took more pictures an dit turns out just to be some landforms and shadows.        ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

I know what I would do. I would call them crazy and explain to them that aliens do not exsist and that it was a fact of science.

The 'Face on Mars' is a natural landform. The light from the sun is shone across the landform to make it look like it has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth like a human person, but, if you were to create an exact copy of Mars, put on a different scale, hold it still, and shine light at the exact angle of the sun, you would see that the sun is what really causes the 'Face on Mars' to appear to look the way it does.

Aliens, if they exsisted, could not have created something so magnificent and perfect that at that angle it would look like a face. Scientists have studied the geography of Mars for years and have had nothing to say about aliens. They have prooven their facts and have given us reason to believe that this was simply the way Mars was stuctured and that the rays of the Sun are the cause of it looking like a face.

If aliens did create the 'Face on Mars', why would our scientist have not discovered them? Why havent we ever then seen one before? For those that believe that it was aliens that sculpted Mars, I am sorry, but you are wrong. Mars was naturally formed and can never and will never be changed by aliens because aliens simply do not exsist.

So, for all of those out there in our lovely world that think that aliens do infact exsist and that they somehow, over millions of years created a 'Face on Mars', I would like to say one last thing on my behalf, aliens do not exsist and could not have created something so mindblowing.

It is, in fact, a mesa, or butte, like on earth. It is a platform of naturally formed rock on the surface of mars. The shadows on the mesa make it look kind of like a face, when it is actually just a natural formation. The picture showed the differet cracks and dips in the formaton that made the shadows on the mesa. In America, there are lots of different mesas, such as the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

It may look like a face on Mars, but that is ecaue of the Viking 1 didn't have the most accurate cameras. The pictures were taken more than 35 years ago. They didn't have cameras as advanced as we do. The Viking 1 took those pictures in 1976. Each pixel spanned 43 meters. That is not a very defined picture. In 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor took some pictures of the ""face"" with a more advanced camera at its highest resolution. Each pixel only spanned 1.56 meters. That means that its a very accurate picture. It showed how the ""face"" was actually a mesa.

There are always possibilities of alien life having to do with the formation, but that is a very very slim chance. Conspiracy theorists are not necessarily profesionals. NASA scientists can easily see how the face is just a formation. They would probably be really glad if the formation was made by extraterrestrials, but they know that it wasn't made by aliens.

In conclusion, the ""face on Mars"" is just a land formation called a mesa. Scientists have taken more recent pictures with the Mars Global Surveyor to prove that it is a land formation.

F610BC7142D3,"In the world, there are people who believe in aliens or supernatural beings, while some do not. The face on Mars is an example of an occurance that causes people to believe in aliens or supernatural beings. Even though this is true, there are still many people who think the landform is a natural occurance. There are ways to prove that this theory for the landform is true. Reasons such as the landform being compared to natural, earth landforms and it has similar characteristics as earth lanforms help prove this is true.

The landform was compared to a butte or a messa. This means it is quite similar to earthly landforms and may have occured due to something that happened on Mars. The face on Mars is comapared one main earth landform that was mentioned. The landform is Middle Butte, which is located in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It was a lava dome that took the form of an isolated mesa.

The face on Mars had the same look and height as a Earth landform, a mesa. It is true that there is an unusual shape to the face on Mars, there are similar occurances that happen on Earth. Though this happens on Earth, people don't say that these Earth landforms were made by aliens.

This landform is just like other occurances on seperate planets that resemble Earth landforms. Even though the landform resembles a human face, it doesn't mean the landform is an alien's doing.

F58FC37EB0BD,"The Viking 1 photo taken in 1976 is a photo from Mars of what seems to be a face-looking structure. Many believe that this is some sort of alien life form left behind, but some believe the reality, in which this is just some type of land structure or a land-form.

This land structure has shadows and divets on it that resemble the facial details of a human face. NASA has been searching for alien life-forms or any life on another planet for years and some believe that they have finally accomplished this. A lot of people think that this is some sort of fossil or ingravement of a once-living alien or a species of unknown classification.

As this very well could be the case, with the fact that it is sort of engraved into the ground of the planet, the most likely explanation of this abnormality is this--this is a coincidental pattern on this rock-like form. There is no more to it. Coinicidental.

As stated in Paragraph 5, this form has spraked a lot of attention throughout the years. Many people believe many different theories; some reasonable, and some not. Conspiracy Theorists state that they believe NASA is hiding more evidence about this, but that cannot be true, because if this was a life-form, NASA would be rolling in fame, not hiding it from the world.

This is Mars we are talking about. We have tried for years and years to get human life onto this planet, and to attempt at finding life as well. The conditions of Mars are unbearable, so there is no possible way a creature could survive. We're not ET.

As stated in Pararaph 12, Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte n the Snake River of Idaho."" This is most definently a landform. Mars is considered the Red Planet. Mars is covered in dirt, grime, and dust. This could have easily formed with winds hitting the dirts.

As you can see in the progression of the pictures, these are obviously shadows from the sun, or dirt formations. If this was a life-form, these divets in the body would not be fading away, they would stay fossilized and stay put. In 1998, it does not even look like a face, nonetheless in 2001, either.

Next, as you can tell in the lower image featured in the paragraph, you can see another structure just a couple of feet to the left of the ""face"", and nobody seems to care about that. It does kind of look like an animal, so are we just going to question every single little pebble that we find on a planet? Didn't think so.

In conclusion, this 1976 photo taken on Mars by the Viking 1 spacecraft is most definently a landform of some kind. There is no possible way that a creature could sustain life on a planet like this. This discovery is obviously just a hoax or a coincidental find. If scientists had found this structure a couple of years later, it would not have looked like this face, so they would have never even questioned it.     ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

If i were given a chance towork for NASA truthfully i would not take the job i don't really like science jobs like that . Anyways , i don't think that the faces were created by aliens . (Why dont i think it was created by aliens) that's a very good question first off aliens are made up creatures they are just tools to make science non fictional movies come to life . I just strongly think that aliens are made up they can't be real there is no proof to back up what everyone believes . Space doesn't have any gravity so their can't be any animals up there floating ! The mask kinda looks like clay maybe the mask is made out of clay that you can mold it into anything you want ! I know that sounds crazy but someone thinking that a alien created makes it sound even more crazier ! Lets be VERY serious The article says ""Face on Mars has been popular in magazines and talk shows"" People will believe anything these days even i know that half of the things that the media says or does is not true and i also know that they make things up for attention or too be well known . Now if i got paid as much as the talk show host i may have told some fibs from time to time !

Body - I have to remember that everybody has a opinion and everybody has a input . I am a ""Show me and i'll believe type girl"" I don't have any evidence or proof that Aliens are real and that they the mask it just doesnt fit together that's like saying pigs can fly ! There is NO proof so i can't process it i know somebody named De'Oshmonya that knows a lot about mars and space so i may have to ask her what she thinks about it im sure she will tell me everything i need to know ! It may cause a little argument tho , but thats okay we're still going to be close . This passage helped me because it taught me some things i didn't know and it prepares me for the future it does make me wonder Are aliens real ? When i go to sleep tonight i may do some research and i'll try to find some proof . I should've done research so i could have a lot of evidence to back my statement up that would've been the best thing to do .

Conclusion - Even tho i said i don't believe in aliens it does make me question alot of things . This article was written way before i was born things have changed and everything should be different now. Maybe if aliens were real they were probably alive in the ancient times and probably left when the dino's left . I just never know Ela is my favorite subject it always makes me learn new things and it helps me understand more than i knew before . Ela is very tricky and sometimes it gets confusing but in the end it helps you and expands your knowladge to the finer things in life . I hope that you got the correct answers out of my paragraph hopefully i can come back next year and be prepared to tell everyone about my research !!!",1,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

So, why believe there was ever ancient civilization on Mars, if through out all the research, nothing was ever found. Some still disagree and believe that there is new life on Mars. But, in order for there to be a new there has to be an old.

When Garvin decided he wanted to get a better look at the face on Mars himself, he also agreed that it would be a natural landform. He used a digital image three times bigger that the pixle size. Therefore, if there were any signs of live, shakes, houses, aliens, ect. you would be able to point it out from the picture.

Yet, there was still nothing found. Although some people still believe aliens live on Mars, and aliens created the face structure. There is proof that you can not spot any digns of life on Mars. So, therefore, we come to the conclusion that the structure was a natural landfor, that just so happened to look like a face.   ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Most of the pictures that were taken of this landform were compared to other landforms that are on Earth. The ""Face on Mars"" was compared to landforms such as, The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Both landforms are about the same height.

In the photos, there is no signs of any alien artifact. There isn't any monuments, pyramids, or symbols found around this landform. Other than a shadow that looked like an Egyptian Pharoah, wasn't anything else found to suspect aliens made ""The face on Mars."" If there was an ancient civilization on Mars, it would help us figure out how this was made.

5DB50E75D92A,"Some people believed that the ""Face on Mars"" was an alien monument, and still do. This was a conspiracy theory that had been proven wrong many times by us scientists at NASA. When we first discovered this face, there was a degree of surprise among the mission controllers. But they soon figured it was another Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Only this one had different shadows that gave the appearance of an Egyption Pharaoh, which caused the theories of it being an extra terrestrial monument.

When we had unveiled the photograph of the rock formation out into the public, it had been captioned that it was a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This had been done to attract attention, and it did. People began to think the Face was evidence of life on Mars that NASA would rather hide. But, our NASA budgeters wish there was life on Mars because it would benefit our investigations and bring in more money. NASA would have abosolutely no reason to hide this information from the public.

Yet, theorists are unconvinced. On April 5, 1998, we sent the Mars Global Surveyor to fly over Cydonia and to take photographs that were ten times sharper than the original photos. We first uploaded these images onto a JPL website, explaining that the Face was a natural landform and that it was not a monument built by aliens.

People were still not satisfied with our information at this point. Our mission controllers prepared to inspect the Face again. This time, our controllers used a camera that spanned 1.56 meters on the maximum resolution, which captured a breath-taking image. This image shows that the Face is an equivalent of a butte or mesa. This is a common landform on Earth, and proves that the Face on Mars is just an oddly shaped area of land.

I do understand why people may have thought that this landform was evidence of life on Mars, but us workers at NASA gave real evidence that it wasn't. Our mission controllers had taken three different images showing more and more proof that it was just another landform. The mission controllers had used cameras with extreme resolution that had the ability to see airplanes or pyramids if there were any. But there wasn't, and there still isn't.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that there is no life on Mars because there is no actual evidence proving my belief wrong. To all those who still believe the Face on Mars was a monument built by aliens, I truly hope you will read this and realize that theories are theories until proven true.

E6265A333F78,"Did you know that NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was the first spacecraft of any sort to see the mysterious face on Mars? This mysterious face was first discovered in 2001. I am a scientist from NASA that has been researching this unusual, shadowy likeness of a human face since about twenty-five years ago. My name is Ellie. I get all sorts of questions and opinions asked to me about the human face. Some people say that they do not think that it's real, and that NASA is just making it up to get more people to notice us. Well, that would be wrong, considereing that we have pictures to prove it. We know that the face is just a natural landform because the pictures show it to be almost equivalent of a mesa or butte, and it looks identical to the Middle Butte in Idaho.

We know that the shadowy likeness of a human face is just a natural landform because is looks almost equivalent to a mesa or a butte. We have many questions asking things like, "" How do you know that aliens didn't form it?""

and, ""How do we know that this picture is not photoshopped to get NASA more commercial business?"" The answer is we don't know exactly what formed it, but our research shows that it is a natural landform. First of all, pictures do not lie, especially that camera that we took it with. We took the picture with using a camera's absolute maximum resolution. In this camera, ""each pixel in the 2001 images spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo"" as we know from our research. Also, the mysterious landform that we captured looked like a mesa or a butte- landforms that are common around the American Midwest. to add to that, the Face takes the same shape as a lava dome and the same height. Not only does the face look almost equivalent to a mesa or butte, but it also looks almost identical to most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Another reson that we know that the Face is just a natural landorm is because it looks almost identical to a landform is Idaho. People send NASA emails, and letters asking questions. One of our most states opinions is,"" Just because it looks like a landform on Earth doesn't mean anything. Things might be different there and there could be aliens there."" Yes that could be true, but our research and pictures also prove it to be wrong. The first snapshot of the Face was captured was a long time ago. Since then our camera and photo quality has improved. Today we now have way better pictures of the Face than we did over twenty-five years ago. That means that we can see the landform better and look at the different characteristics of the landform. Then after we looked at the characteristics, we found that the Face had almost the exact same size, shape, quality of a landform in Idaho, United States. Also, one of our researches stated the definition of the Middle Butte. He stated,""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face in Mars. Thousands of web surfers had been anxiously waiting for images for NASA to be revealed. Until one day we released the pictures. As we knew already, web surfers found that there was ""no alien monument after all"" as we know from our research. We also released how we took the picture. We had a picture taken by a camera on board MGS, but it had to peer through clouds. Then people started saying statements like,"" Perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze."" Once again, that cannot be true because the characteristics and qualities of the Face look exactly like a part of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

Now you have been proved wrong, and I hope all your questions were answered about the Face, or at least the questions that were stated in the article. we have done a lot of research on this mysterious human face, and found that it was not created by aliens. We know that it is a landform because it looks like a mesa or a butte, and it looks almost identical to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Therefore, this Face is just a landform.

C20011D6FA9D,"In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it talks about the face on Mars and how it was put there. Three ways scientists have concluded, is that there was once life on Mars and the face is from Aliens that once lived there. Others think it was hit by a huge rock and where it got hit it left an identation that just looks like a face. Or that the Face is just something that formed there naturally but to the human eye it looks like a face.

In my opionion I believe the face was put there by a rock or it just formed naturally and that there was no aliens on Mars. I say this because rock formations happen all the time along with rocks bumping into planets causing indentations on planets. Even most scientists believe it was not put there by an alien like in paragraph 6 of the article it says, ""Few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact."" I also believe that the face was put there by either a rock or just formed there by itself because if it was put there by a alien how have we not ever seen any of the aliens there on Mars or around Mars not only recently but ever? Or how have we not found any other artifacts left behind by aliens?

So in conculsion all of the information I have read in this article show me that any of the theories could be true but I still believe that the Face is just an identation on Mars left from a rock collesion or just formed there naturally. Especially since we do not have any other artifacts of it being put there by a alien or another living thing.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
8B7A59B8A473,"I believe the face on Mars was not created by aliens. I believe the face is just a natrual land mass that looks like a face from far away. It's almost as if you were to see a person you think you know, but as you get close enough to see their face you dont know them at all.

I believe the face on Mars is a natrual land mass for many reasons. One main reason is that the face is just and elevated area of land. Over the past years many astroids and space debre have hit or landed I could say on Mars. So if astroids landed on the elevated space in places where the eyes, nose, and mouth should be making it look as if a face was on Mars. The article states that the rock formation was as if it was an illusion of the features of a human on the mountain of rock. Another reason is that in the past the ""Face on Mars"" could have been a mountain. Meaning that the winds, dust, and dirt could have worn down the mountain making it into a mesa. The article states that many mesa's have been spotted around Cydonia, making it possible for the ""Face on Mars"" to be just another mesa. The article staes that NASA have taken many pictures of the face and they all revealed ""a natrual landform."" NASA stated that there was no alien monument. Another reason is that Mars used to be an active planet. So if the ""Face of Mars"" used to be a mountain it could have got run down by lava flows in the area. Making it into a landform thta looks like a face.

In conclusion there are many facts and theories about the ""Face on Mars."" People who think the ""Face on Mars"" was created by aliens will have a much tougher time proving that it was created by aliens. Therefore there is many more facts about the ""Face on Mars"" being a natrual land mass. These are just some of the reasons why I believe the ""Face on Mars"" is a natural land mass.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

While taking these pictures, Viking 1 snapped an image of what looked to be a human face on a region of Mars called Cydonia. Since then, two other photos have been taken by Viking 1 in the years 1998 and 2001.

Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa but what made them a little uneasy about that soulution was the face that looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. The head was around 2 miles long from end to end and was formed by shadows that gave off the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. Because of the human-like features that appeared in the photos, people began to believe that the ""face"" was hard evidence that there was some kind of human life on Mars. Due to the fact that some scientist believed that the face was an alien artifact and the picture was the topic of discussion in places all around the world, scientist had to work even harder to find out what the photograph actually showed.

I will be the person you will tell about your theory and I will try to change you belief on the whole idea and if you don't it is just your loss. I will admit I would have loved it to have been an alien monument to some sort of king or ruler too, so we could of seen it more than what it was if it really was an alien monument. That is besides the point here that it is a natural land form like the mesas we have here on Earth.

The first picture had a terrible resolution of 43 meters per pixel! That is completely unaccepltable in today's terms for resolution. The first picture in 1976 was only speculated to be an alien monument was due to the shadows on the land and not the actual characteristics of the land. In 1998 the picture could have been altered due to fog, but in 2001 a clear picture proved that the ""face"" on the mesa was just nothing to be excited about. Also if it was some sort of landmark of an ancient civilization you probably could have seen houses or shacks somewhere near it. Also why would we cover up an amazing dicovery that could benefit us in the long run with more funding and credibility.

To put down the truth your theory is more like a thought than an actual theor a this point due to the facts that already prove that it is a mesa a lot like our in on earth. You have to support your statement with much more than an outdated pickture taken about 40 years ago and just accept the facts that are in your face laid out right now the unaccuracy f the first picture, the shadows only showing that if could have been a face, and how why we would cover up soming thing that could get us more publicity to the public eye and more funding.

9B3BE4B60A62,"Twenty five years ago an enormous head almost two miles end to end has been seen to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called Cydonia. For some conspiracy theorists, they thought that it was a sign of life on Mars, or it may be from some kind of ancient civilization that was there millions of years ago. Some of them say it almost looks like the ancient egyption statues built on Earth.

Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, after the viking missions ended. Chief scientist explained ""We felt this was important to taxpayers."" So on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia, Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. They've got new technology so now the picture has more detail in it, it even shows some rocks on the Mars surface. When the picture was released to the public, it was now revealed a natural landform, no sign of alian civilization or any type of mark.

Not everyone was satisfied with the Face being ruled a natural landform. Some say the camera on board Mars Global Surveyor had to look through clods to see the Face. Skeptics considered alien markings were hidden by the clouds. The Face is a very interesting much more can lay behind the discovery but as the Global Surveyor pass through it when it is all clear they take a picture that is very vlear for all to see. The extraordinary photo was the best photo they have ever taken of the face ruling it a natural landform.

The Face is a very popular among Hollywood films. It has appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, and more, It is truly a pop icon. SOme people think that that face a very good evidence for life on Mars. Evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorist, Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget would rather wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.

The Face resembles a human face like the statues in our ancient civilzation built by egyptians. Our ancient monuments are very and amazingly common to the Face. What if this was ancient civilization at its best. After the cloudless summer picture the world has ruled The Face a natural landform not ancient monument in any means, Some Skeptics still believe however.

The pictures taken were blurry but showed to actually be a face indicating there was life on Mars sometime in the past or even here in the present. NASA kept studying this mask for years to come. A few years later, another satellite took pictures about 10 times sharper and clearer. But in this picture, the so called mask just looked like a normal everyday landform.

6992DB89C147,"I believe that the face was land made because in the picture from 1976 in the fifth pharagraph, it looks like a face. But when you look at the other pictures at the top of the article you don't see any dips that point towards alien creation. I belive that like, in the article, it was just an effect of the light and shadows. The shadows could have been made by a higher point of the mesa and when the light hit it just right, it made it look like a face. In the last pharagraph, Jim Garvin, the cheif scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program said, "" It reminds me of Snake River Plain in Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

To me Garvin's idea of what the Face on Mars really is, seem very logical. There have been land formations that people say are made by aliens. But, for all we know it could have been man made millions of years ago. We will never know because we don't have strong enough evidence to prove if it was man made, a creation made by aliens, or was simply made over time. Looking at the third image at the top of the article, you can see that there is nothing on the surface of the Face on Mars. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern thins in a digital image 3 times bigger then the pixle size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shake, you could see what they were."" Garvin said in pharaghraph eleven.

From far away the Face looks like, well, a face. But, once you get a close up of it you can see that it was only a forplay of shadows. The things that we hear about on the news, in magazines, radio talk shows, films, and books get so blown out of praportion that people will read it and believe that there really is a face on mars that was created by aliens. I understand that there are some things that we really don't know about, and maybe never will. But, I believe that if there are aliens, that we would be given some strong evidence that they were on mars, earth or wherever.

But, for now, we will have to keep looking into things and discover more things about earth and the things that happened on earth and to earth millons of years ago.

There is a great population of people who believe aliens exist and cause strange things to happen and space crafts to appear. Many people know that it is just science fiction and that there is no evidence showing that aliens actually exist. This has been going on for decades and the believers need to face the truth. They can belive as long as they want, but there is no evidence.

The Face on Mars was not created by aliens, but is a natural landform. Meteors and other space rocks strike the planets, and even the moon. Those can be a possible cause of the Face on Mars. With astronauts exploring Mars to see if it is capable of supporting life, the Face could be caused by the humans collecting large amounts of the planet and walking all over it. Aliens are nothing but a fictional character in the many Hollywood movies.

As humans with the sense of sight, we are used to seeing faces on a daily basis. We look at clouds and depict them as something we have seen before. Or a tree that looks like a face was made out of it's bark. It is understandable that you could see a face on Mars because that is human imagination. The Face is just a natural effect of what caused it to happen. Sure, we might not know about everything that goes on in space, but we do know that many people are interested in the fact that Mars may be able to suport life.

Scientist are doing everything they can to know more than enough about Mars. They have rovers and cameras to look at Mars from Earth and be able to study it without traveling all the way there. There are many photos and videos of Mars and what you might see there, but no aliens were found. Their equipment is high quality and no blurs or scratches could be seen as something it's not.

For those who support the belief that aliens roam Mars, they can invest on the discovery, but find it wasteful. The Face is just a landform and you would need evidence to support your alien claim. There are many photos that were taken over time of the Face and the differences could be because of erosion or asteroids. Many things go on in space, but alien activity isn't one of them.

Some people were not convinced that the face was a natural landform , due to there being haze, winds and also a cloudy time to see the face through the camera, there were conspriacy theorists that said ""Perhaps skeptic and alien markings were hidden by the haze.""

But then on April 8 , 2001 almost 3 years later - a cloudless summer day, Mars Global Surveyor drew close to the ""Face on Mars"" they had to ""roll 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view"" said Gravin. Malins team captured a extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution, each pixel spans 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo to finally prove that ""The Face on Mars"" is a natural landform, Still to this day there are conspiracy theorist who believe that ""The Face on Mars"" was not a natrual making!

E67A118F9AFA,"This all started 21 years ago. Here is how the face on Mars was discovered. NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars, taking pictures for possible landing sites for it's sister Viking 2 and it spotted a shadown of a likely human face. It was a great big head shaped face 2 miles apart from end to end. That is how this all started.

How could aliens make such a thing? There is no way. Some scientist believe that the face was an alien artifact, the photographing from Cydonia became a priorty for NASA when MGS showed up at the Red Planet in Sepmber. The face was not created by some things we like to call aliens that we don't even know if they exist or not, kind of like mermiads or unicorns.

There is to much evidence of how this face could of formed on it's own. It was so bi it would take aliens so long to even make this thing we say that looks like a face. Some people belive that the face is ""bona fide"", which means that that face is evidence that there was life on Mars at one point. Nobody has that big of a face for it to be an actual human face. I believe it is just a natual landform that just happened to look a lot like a human face. The face is exactly located 41 degrees North martian latitude where it was winter in April '98, a very cloudy time on the Red Planet. This investigation the scientist haas said has been very hard work to figure out exaclty what it is. I still belive with all the evidence we have it has to just be God's creation and it just apeared to look like a face, no aliens or anything like that because if you want to tell me that aliens did it you better be showing me that aliens even exist first.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
07D0B701C682,"Have you ever sat in your room and looked at the ceiling for a while and you see a weird shape or face? If you haven't have you ever stared into space and seen a shape or face? Do you think of how it got there, from an alien, your imagination, or natural landform? My guess would be natural landform.

I am saying natural landform because alians aren't real, and if they were why would they create a human face. Maybe they were tryin to send a sign, if they were trying to send a sign why couldn't they have just come to earth and tell us what we need to know. What was the point of going to Mars no one lives on Mars we live on Earth.

The is a 50/50 chance that it could be your imagination, just like if you were staring out of space or looking up at the ceiling and see a random shape or face, that is your imagination, so it could be you imagination. But the scientist wasn't really focused on this ""face"" they just happened to look over an see it otherwise just like if it was your imagination you would be very focused on to something and happen to see it.

It is a natural landform because when Mars came about this ""face"" was made along with it no one else put it their it naturaly came along. You can believe that it was put their by an alien but by the evidence and how I proved it you might think that it natural landform.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
9ADD67103D55,"Unmasking the Face on Mars is a mystery that is still to be solved. Me as a NASA scientist, I have many pieces evidence to prove that this mysterious face landform was just caused by craters or natural weathring straking the red planet. My evidence will prove a person who believes in aliens creating this face incorrect.

To prove that aliens didn't have any effect on Mars, many natural landforms we have on earth can predict and support that this face was naturally occuring. These images in 1976, 1998, and 2001 remind scientists of the landforms on Earth such as a butte or mesa. To prove this, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) caught images of the face on camera. It was clear it was just a regular landform, not a special, purposefully made alien monument.

The technology we have today makes it clear that the face was just made by natural causes. Our cameras have a clear shot and bigger pixel size digital image. They would have seen any other objects located around the landform like airplanes or pyramids that people believe were made by aliens. There weren't any! The landform looks like a face in ways but it's easy to tell it was made by incoming asteroids on the landscape of the planet. The light from the sun and the shadowing just makes the landform look as if it had eyes, nose, and a mouth.

This evidence given proves a person who believes that aliens created this mysterious face on the red planet wrong. Through the process of unmasking the face, it is clear that natural disasters and weathering happened to create a resemblance of this structure. Unmasking the Face on Mars is still a mystery to be solved for years to come.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

As you see, throught the years, the world has devolped better technology. We've made better cameras and have found out a way to make things even more clear. In 1976, the picture appears blurry. It doesnt look focused on it at all. So what I am trying to say is, that this could not have been clear at first and that they didn't know what they were seeing at first. It could have been there the whole time.

The texts states what the picture actually shows. It says, ""what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-- landforms common around the American West."" This is a landform. Garivn states that it reminds him most of Middle Butte in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho. People have seen this types of landforms on Earth too, and there is no aliens on Earth. they have said it's a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa.

In the text, it says that scientists figured it was just another Martin mesa. They even said it was common around that area, Cydonia. The only thing that was different was, that it had shadows around it. That is completly normal for shadows to appear.

According to the research I have learned, I believe that this was not made by aliens. I believe, that this is a landform. There is no scienitifict proof that an alien had decided to make this. There is no actual evidence.      ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

By jimmy

NASA`s had send a spacecraft called Viking 1. Many of the people that were working on this were think it was something else. When it came out 1976 many peolpe think it was made by aliens. But on one know that it was. So it be came an icon for the plant mars. Many people think it was aliens that made the face or hills that from the face on mars. 22 years later Mars Global surveyor had a spacecaft that was going aronud mars to the face but when they did they take the image. Many were happy to see other image. But it did not came a clear as they what it to be. But what i think it could be is that a rock may crash into mars and made the face. But over time sand bulid over it gave what it look like in 1976. In the photograph you can see that it maybe face but you can see that it can be a hill. What are the black spot in the photograph that we see here. It could be that is that can be made on mars by wnich it from by.

D63FEA7915D2,"Firs of all I'd like to state that there has been no scientific proof of life on Mars yet. Im sure if there was life on Mars NASA would have made a big deal about it already. If you look closely enough at the rock in the picture you'll see that it is just a rock. It could of been a lucky rock formation that looks like a face. Just because it does look like a face doesn't mean it has to be from aliens. We have many cool looking rock formations here on earth. Does that mean their made from aliens too? If this particular rock was created by aliens wouldn't the other close to it be made by them too? However the rocks right next to it are just rocks and nobody makes a big deal about them.

If there is ever life on Mars im sure the public would know by now. We all know once something weird or mythical happens the public is quick to find out. There are about 1 in 1,000,000 chances that this is made by aliens. Were not even sure if aliens are real yet. We dont have any real proof they exist, so why do we quickly think its from them? I think people are just jumping to conclusions here. There is a really good chance that this is just a rock. Trust me though, if it was made by aliens NASA would of freaked out by now. For now lets just say its a really cool looking rock until further notice.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
AAE543DD8842,"In 1976 a NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was going around Mars looking and taking pictures of places where Viking 2 could land. It spotted a shadow that looked like a human face. It was a huge head about 2 miles from one end to the other end. The face looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. Some scientists figured out it was just a mesa but people started thinking it could be proof that aliens were real. They then started making movies of the face and magazines and stuff like that because they believed aliens had created the face.

NASA already knew it was just a common mesa. NASA and the scientists already knew it was a mesa but it looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh. As soon as they showed the public the picture people started believing that it could be evidence that aliens created that and are living. Hollywood started making movies, books, and a lot of other stuff. Scientists wanted to be sure that it was just a mesa, so NASA then sent another spacecraft. They took another picture and saw that it looked nothing like the first picture. They had to send another spacecraft in 2001 just to make sure it wasn't a mistake and to see which one was correct. The picture looked different too but looked so much better so NASA and scientists told the public it was a mesa.

The face in Mars was just a natural landform. The same thing basically happens around Western America. A guy, Garvin, said that the face reminds him of Middle Butte in Idaho. He said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height at the face on Mars."" The first picture they took in 1976 of the face really looks like not a natural landform. As the cameras got more better, in 1998, the face kind of still had the face shape but it looked more flat. The picture in 2001 just made the face look just like a natural landform. The 2001 picture, which is the latest one, shows no proof of living things in mars. The face looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh in the first picture they took. The latest picture, in 2001, the face looked like a butte or mesa. The face was just a natural landform like the landforms that happen in Western America. If it was proof that there is living things in Mars, it would be beneficial for both tax payers and NASA. Hopefully they'll go again soon and take pictures to confirm if it was a natural landform or it's really proof that there is living things in mars, but I don't think they're going to go again because a lot of people now believe it was just a natural landform.

At last, the face was just a natural landform and was not made by aliens. The face did really look like it was created because that's what the people in ancient times bascically did but it was just a landform. The picture first picture was really cool not going to lie and I thought it was created by a living thing but when I saw the recent pictures it just started to look like a natural landform. Maybe they'll find more evidence and confirm if it was just a natural landform or if it was created by aliens, who knows.       ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
A8E41CE3FF6F,"The question is: created by aliens or just a natural landform? To the uninformed citizen, their answer would most likely be that the Face is created by aliens, and that we should all prepare for Earth's destruction. However, a well trained scientist at NASA, (like me), knows that the Face on Mars is obviously a natural landform.

You might be wondering how the Face on Mars got it's features. It might seem as if it was manmade because no amount of corrosion could make it look like an ""Egyptian Pharaoh."" That answer would be half correct because even though this natural landform is not manmade, the Face's features have not been created by corrosion. Shadows simply appeared in the picture, making it seem as if it were a face of an ancient pharoah. The Face is just another Martian mesa that is commonly found around Cydonia.

Although it is important to know how the Face got it's features, it is also important to know why NASA promoted this Martian mesa as ""the Face on Mars.""

NASA decided that promoting the pictures of the Face could make the public more interested in Mars. We were correct in this sense because it definitely attracted people towards Mars and it's peculiar landform. However, we were incorrect in the idea of promoting it as a Martain mesa that had the features of a pharoah. This image confused the public, and people started believing that there were actual aliens on Mars and that these aliens had made the Face. No matter how many times scientists released research that demolished the idea of life on Mars, the public twisted the story so that it was more interesting.

Even though there was an abundance of research showing there were no aliens making the Face, NASA went out and took more pictures. These images showed that it was only a natural landform, and that there are no actual features on the Face. As I said before, the features were merely created by shadows.

Of course, people still argued that NASA was wrong. People kept saying that the ""markings"" were hid by the clouds, and that these images were simply a failure on NASA's part. This failure being that they somehow forgot to take into account that there was clouds. However, as NASA was more than careful taking these pictures, the images were as accurate as possible.

The Face on Mars may just be a hoax, but NASA's research is nothing of the sort. NASA has proven that their detailed research is used to make sure that the public is well informed. The Face may have just been a natural landform, but the public's enthusiasm for these images, (no matter how skeptical), is something that can never be recreated with shadows.

Using the evolution of technology and cameras we have taken multiple pictures to prove what it is. Here I will explain what we did to take pictures of this mysterious thing.. We will also explain why people believed us to be wrong.

In 1976 the Viking 1 took pictures so we could find a good landing spot for the sister ship The Viking 2. That is when the pictures the ship took were sent back to us to examine. That is when we first saw the 2 mile long face for the first time. The suprise was short lived however as we soon relised what it was,a messa. People were sure it was more than that. They believed it to be a space craft.

In 1998 we sent a different ship,the Mars Global Surveyor, back there to locate the face and to take better pictures of the face. People were still not impressed with the finding of the MGS. There was fog in the picture as the area the face is in is always foggy. They said the fog was obsurring the photo. They also belived that aliens were using fog to hide it and some alien space crafts they belived was surrounding the face. They picture without the fog to beleive what we saw.

In 2001 we again sent the MGS to take pictures of the face. We went on a clear summer day when there was no fog presant and we had to tilt the camera 25 degress to get the picture right on. This picture had the face bigger than a thum compared to the pixel sized faces before it. It was exacly the picture they need to prove it was a messa.

As you can see in the photos it is a messa on a different plant. Comparring it to Earth it would be just like the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The eyes nose and mouth were just shadows being casted onto it which is why the other pictures have the feature while the new one does not . After 25 years of people talking and theorizing about it on the new and on the radio we can finally put an end to this mystery.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
884006EB1249,"I know you may think that the face was made by aliens, but it isn't. How I know? Well in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" NASA lists a whole bunch of reasons against this alien conspiracy. Number one, it is probably just another Martian mesa, which are common around Cydonia. Number two, it looks like a regular landform due to comparisons to Earths landforms. Lastly, number three, sometimes the face isn't even there due to its missing shadows. Conspirators would probably think that NASA would hide evidence of alien acts but NASA is so confident that this is not aliens that they showed the face to the public. You're probably thinking: Why should I believe you? Do you have evidence? As in fact I do.

Number one, it's probably just another Martian mesa. Scientists have proven that there are a lot of mesa's around Cydonia, a region on Mars where the face is located. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" In this quote from the text it reveals how the face, if it is just a Martian mesa, is actually rather common on Cydonia. In that quote it also reveals that the face only has ""unusual shadows"" that give the face an effect of looking like an ""Egyptian Pharaoh"".

Number two, scientists claim it just looks like a regular landform. ""What the picture acually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin."" In this quote a man named Garvin has compared the face to some landforms on Earth. By comparing the face to a landform, it makes the face acually seem more like its just a regular landform.

Number three, sometimes the face isn't even there. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing ... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" Before this quote had even happened a man named Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture of the face only to realize it was just a regular landform. When the face was not in the picture that was supposed to be ten times sharper than the original Viking photo's proves that maybe the face is just a landform with unusual shadows for a face afterall.

Conspiracy theories believe that the face was made by aliens, but scientists have proven with research that that the conspiraters theory has a very big lack of credibility. Scientists have proven, number one, it is most likely just a Martian mesa with shadows for a face because Martian mesa's are common on Cydonia. Number two, its most likely just a regular landform due to its comparison's to Earths landforms. Number three, sometimes the face isn't even there because the shadows are gone.

66116A00F7BB,"A lot of scientists think that the Face was created by aliens. I know that it is just a natural landform. They have no evidence that there is aliens on Mars but they say aliens made the Face.

First, I feel this is just a natural landform because why would aliens just attempt to make a human face. They have no reason to because they don' t know what we look like. Even if there is aliens then they wouldn't make a face of human's for no reason. The passage states that they made an emourmous head, but why would they make a sculpture of a head and not the whole body. If the alien's actually knew what we look like then why would they only make a head.

Next, honestly the pictures that these people got overtime doesn't even look like a human face. It looks like a bird that has just fading away. Speaking real it's just a natural landform. It could be a crater or the wind just chipped away at it. It would be cool if the aliens made the sculpture but none of those people have clear evidence or proof that alien's made this.

Lastly, on the high definition picture it could be a reflection of some kind because the place where the eyes are supposed to be it is black. Also, on the right side it looks like they cut it off because that is not easy to see. The right side looks like a straight line. So, erosion could have eroded the right side off of the natural landform. The picture shows that there is craters beside ""the Face"" this is a big clue to me that the lanform is natural.

To examplify, this would be practically impossible to say because they are assuming that alien's did this when it could honestly be anything. It would make most sense to be a natural landform because even on Earth there are natural landforms that look like objects or animals. This is why i think it's a natural landform.

5B235B3984C4,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a landform seen in photographs of the surface of Mars. Some people believe that this landform is proof that alien life exists and that this landform was created by said aliens. However, there is plenty of information to disprove this. This information is found in the article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars.""

The article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" states, ""Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say some conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" This statement suggests that NASA would have no reason to hide evidence of alien life, as this would benefit NASA greatly. If NASA had discovered evidence of alien life, NASA would have presented it as such.

Later on, photographs were taken of the landform once again. However, the camera had to ""peer through whispy clouds to see the Face."" Because of this, some skeptics believed that alien markings were hidden by the haze, which is shown in the quote, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by the haze."" In response to this, another picture was taken on a cloudless day, showing that the Face was nothing more than a natural land form.

This landform is similar to some of the landforms on Earth, as shown by the quote, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" Another quote to prove that the Face is similar to formations on Earth is, ""It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This suggests that the Face could have been formed much in the same way as the Earth formation mentioned in the quote.

The fact that, in the photographs of the fornation, there is no evidence to prove alien life is also a factor to consider. A quote by Garvin shows why this is an important peice of information to consider. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were any objets in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This proves that because no evidence of alien life can be seen in the pictures, means that there is none. In these pictures, claims Garvin, you could discern objects easily and tell what they are. If so, NASA can easily confirm that this land formation is natural and that there is no evidence of alien life.

Thus, the Face on Mars is a natural land formation. If it was evidence of alien life, NASA would have presented the information as such. NASA would have then pursued the lead that proved alien life exsisted by attempting to find this alien life or more evidence to prove that alien life exsisted. NASA would have beneiftted greatly if the Face had been created by alien life forms. This formation is also very similar to some land formations found on Earth. If such formations are found natrually on Earth, could they not also be found naturally on other planets? This land formation on Mars is natrual, as similar land formations are found naturally on Earth and NASA finding proof of alien life would have benefitted them greatly. If these things are true, then the Face on Mars is a land form that occurred naturally, and we, the people of Earth, have yet to find evidence that alien life exsists in our univserse.

E376467BFBCC,"Many people think that the face on mars is a monument created by aliens, but these people are mistaken. Scientists have many sources of evidence that shows that this face is just a natural landform on Mars.

First, after NASA unveiled the image for all to see, the image caption said,"" huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This tells us that right away NASA never thought it was anything casued by aliens. Also, in paragraph 5, the texts states, ""Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars - evidence that NASA would rather hide."" But when you think about it, this wouldn't make much since. Defenders of the NASA budget wishes there was an ancient civilization on Mars because it would help out their cause for NASA.

Next, NASA sent more scientists into space to do more research. When the Scientists got there on April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took a photo ten times sharper than the first Viking photos. Then in the article, it says, "" Thousads of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all.""

The Face on Mars is just a naturel land form. From 1976 to 2001 People have been taking pictures of the Face on Mars and every time they took a picture of the Face on Mars they got closer to it and as you look at the pictures you can see that the space in which the Face on Mars is located you can see that it is just a mesa that formed naturely on Mars.

5203AF1AF353,"The 'Face' on Mars is just a hoax. It seems as though the mound on this planet is just a mesa. If you don't believe me, then listen to me very closely. The very similar face on the side of Mars can be very defining but not a single astronout have researched at the Mesa up close and personal. But even if it was made by aliens, it still wouldn't tally up right?

The 'Face' was first noticed in 1976 by Viking 1 spacecraft, circling around Mars, after trying to find its sistership, Viking 2. As Viking 1 was circling around, it spotted a likeness to the human face. And the mound was found in Cydonia, a very well-know area on the Red Planet to house mesas. As the years went by, they looked more into the mound and Scientists concluded that it was just another mesa, but this moutain-like hill had shadows that resemble the human face.

As you review this very peculiar picture, you can see that it just resembles Earth, mostly in Western America. That certain part of America are very popular for its mesas and buttles (which are the same as mesas). There may be more out in the solar system, mnaybe even more in the whole universe itself, but in the end of all the discoveries, they all end up being coincidences.

If you are one of those people who think aliens shaped it you will think differnt by the time your done reading the essay.

Something very mystereous happened in mars 25 years ago. NASA discovered a landform in mars that looked like a very large face. When NASA looked closer in they decided it looked like a pharoh, which is like an old egyptian god. Ever since NASA revealed the mysterious face has become a big pop icon, has starred in movies and multiple talk shows. There has been only very few scientists who belived the face was made by aliens. NASA was very interested in the face so they started taking closer and closer looks. NASA used more powerful lenses which let you get a better look at it. NASA finnaly figured out it was a natural land form. They even went back more than one time to check and everything still proved it was just a natural landform.

What do you think, Is it an alien or is it a natural land form? Facts have proven that it is a natural land form. But all people will never agree if it is an ailen who made it or not.

Also there could have maybe been a symbol of some sort that could tell you or us that it may be out of this world. So studies tell us it isn't a alien monument because well when you look at the picture or image that was taken in 2001. It looks more like a rock or a mesa not something made.

Yes it may look a alien or something out in space made it but there is so much more proof you would need to prove it. Just think to your self how could you have proved that it was made by aliens? What proof do you have? On my side I know it in fact that it could not have been created by a alien because of the pictures tooken. It just doesn't seem like it was created by an alien it just looks like a cool rock that is really out there not created by something from out there.

Yes I do see why you or some people would get that it looks out of this world, but just if you look into it it's really just a landmark on Mars. Yes there may be conspiracys and theories about how this rock or face was made, but there may not be any facts to prove it completly.

So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says ""The ""Face"" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows."" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact.

This shows that people are going against what scientist are saying and that people have opinons that this is just a natural landform, and that this was naturally formed on Mars.

Also, people have taken pictures of this landform with a camera that is ten times sharper than the Viking photos, stated in passage 7. After they took these pictures with this high tech camera it showed there was no alien monument. When this landform was made and the first photo was shown it formed a humans face, it didn't form an alien. In passage 3 it says, ""illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth"" of a human being.

If a alien were to make this landform they would probably make it of them, something that actually looks like them not some other creature, like a human. ""When the camera was located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April '98 it was cloudy on the Red Planet"". While they were searching they never seen Alien markings.

So therfore, the clouds being so cloudy the alien markings where shown as never visible because, they were covered if there was any alien markings but, the camera shows there is no alien markings and that this is a natural landform. Some people have there opinons on if this was reall made by an alien but very few scientist believe this was made by an alien although some do.

The people later find out, it's not an alien after all. After finding this out, people still find a way to believe that the face isn't a landform.

On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original photo. This photo revealed a natural landform. The camera had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and people said alien markings were hidden in the haze. On April 8,2001, they got an even better picture of the rock.

The Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain in Idaho is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

In conclusion, the last picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken on a cloudless day and if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were. The first two pictures may not have been great but after the last picture that was taken, all evidence points to the face on Mars just being a landform and not an artifact of aliens.

1627A070AEBB,"Hello my name is Mr. Baker with NASA, and we are discussing the landform that looks like a face on mars.

This is a landform not an alien marking.

There are known to be little life of aliens.

In fact this landform looks a lot similiar to a natural landmark in Idaho.

But over the last eighteen years scientists at NASA has been studying this landmark for all of this time.

There is no more evidence that it was an alien.

Because there is not a body for this creature unless the planet covered it up and made the body into ashes.

This landform is very unique.

It looks like a face but over the years the picture does not look the same.

Perhaps it was a alien or something extraordinary.

But over the caorse of time the landmark has built up to look like a face.

The pictures from 1998 look way different because of the technology of then and now.

If you look real closely to the pictures you can tell that over the time period that the landform turned from a bunch of scattered dust into a pile that looks like a face, but it is actually not.

Reaserchers say this could be an alien, but I belive not because not one person has found an alien that was alive.

Aliens have been a myth for quite some time now and no one has really ever seen one.

Mars is a landform that is made up of a bunch of different materials and minerals.

Over time there could have been some solar wind and some of the landform blew away and made it look like a face.

From what the photos show people is a face that looks like a human or some kind of life form, and in 1998 the photo shows that it looks like an egyptian pharaoh.

But over time the land mass has changed so if we waited even longer it will change over time.

And over the coarse of another decade or so it will be changed.

Or if the land mass was touched it might break up the loose materials and the landform will be different.

So at the NASA corperation they study the material and the evidence real close.

It might be proven to be a land mass or another source of life somewhere else.

But for all we know right now it is a landmark until someone has proof it is wrong information. So NASA will keep studying the information they have.

Also NASA is trying to develop more information about this landmark. But until then this is known to be a landmark.

So until then this meeting is pronounced over.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Sure there might be other living organisms out in the universe and different species but there is also severe sand storms on mars. Which can throw rocks, make formations on the ground, and bury certain things. These reasons support my claim. The storms would throw random rocks into random places creating what at first may look like a face but once you get closer you see that it is, in fact, rocks.

D96DECC92353,"The ""face"" is just another natural landform, no matter how weirdly shaped. Odd-shaped landforms can be made through wind erosion. Wind erosion can occur on any landform, and the outcome can be any shape. If it was not eroded, the planet could just have a landform different from what we have on Earth. Just because there is an oddly shaped landform on another planet does not mean that it was alien-made.

Much about Mars is undiscovered. This can mean that there are odd landforms which have not yet been discovered. Some of these landforms have the possibility of being shaped like a face or the sillouhette of one. The indentations of the ""faces"" can also be craters from meteors hitting the landforms. Because much is undiscovered, we must not jump to conclusions.

Natural landforms can take many shapes. They can range anywhere from cone-shaped to face-shaped. Just because it resembles a face does not mean it is alien-made. However, it could have been eroded to look similar to one.

AD63E43944A1,"Alien Theory: Debunked

There may be evidence as to why people believe in something as comical as aliens; mass UFO sightings, various reports of alien abduction, passages in religious books and scrolls that show odd evidence of a species not born on Earth, or even on manmade structures such as the ancient pyramids or Egypt. However, we still haven't found credible evidence that aliens are real. The Face is not some sort of bona fide of evidence on life on Mars that NASA would hide. The Face is merely just a natural landform.

After the discovery of the Face, NASA unveiled the image for the public to see. A caption noted a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth."" Authors who knew about it reasoned that it would be a good way to engage the public's attraction to Mars, which it successfully did. The pharaoh look-alike of the mesa was named ""The Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has starred in Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. Many conspiray theorists said that NASA was just hiding more from the public since they said it was only a natural landform. Aliens and ancient civilization became a wide belief, even scientists believed in this. But due to this, the Face became a priority for NASA when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997; 18 years after the Viking missions ended. The chief scientist for NASA's MArs Exploration Program, Jim Garvin said ""We felt this was important to taxpayers.""

When NASA's Viking 1 caught a picture of the Face while it was simply finding a region for its Viking 2 to land, mission controllers may have been amazed or mildly frightened to see this on their monitors. This discovery was short lived because scientists such as myself figured it as just another Martian mesa, which is common around Cydonia, a region on Mars where the Viking spotted the legendary Face. The first photos had bad quality, the best photo having 43 meters per pixel. On April 5, 1998, the MGS flew over Cydonia for the frist time, Micahel Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture 10 times sharper than the original Viking photos. Those who have grown curious to this discovery were upset to only see that THe Face really was only a natural landform. Howver that day they took the photos was a cloudy day on Mars. And so, more disappointment was caused when on April 8, 2001-a cloudless day on Cydonia-MGS took another chance and took another photo. The pixels in the latest image spans 1.56 meters, which is much more better than the original photos from the Viking.

As a rule of thumb, that picture quality would capture more landforms or manmade structures if there were any, but there were not. The latest picture shows the Martian equivalent to a butte or mesa which are landforms that are common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of the Middle BUtte in the Snake River Plain of IDaho,"" says Garvin. That's a lava dome that takes for of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. However, Mars doesn't have life on it. That planet is labeled dead to some scientists.

Though there may be some instance of some alien life form out there, such as the Wow Signal, there isn't enough credible evidence that the Face was made by aliens. As I have already said, landforms such as that MArtian mesa are common on Cydonia. This one just happened to look like a face due to the shadows casted onto it.

Living in the universe alone or with unknown species out there is terrifying, but without enough credible evidence, aliens don't really exist. They're jsut a pigment of imagination caused by the odd funtions of the human brain. All of those alien abductions were most likely hallucination from drug use pr mental diseases.

In this essay I'll give you the answers you need to believe the truth.

In 1976 cameras didn't have good quality picture unlike now. Our technologies are changing and they're changing fast. The 1976 version of the Face was blurry and you could barely see what the picture was. Even the 1998 version was pretty bad, but you could make it out a little more than in 76. The 2001 clearly states that it was in no way a face or an ancient civilization on Mars.

The scientists themselves even felt that what they were seeing was a Mesa. And the second paragraph of the story explains,"" Scienctists figured out it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" Plus in paragraph 12 Garvin says,"" It remind me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plainof Idaho.

Not every writer, newspaper and magazine is right. They don't always get good information thats why you stick to someone you know who will tell you the truth like a scienctist.

So in conclusion, "" The Face on Mars'' isn't really a face at all nor a ancient alien artifact. It's simply a natual landform most likely a mesa or butte. Trust me its not a face its just weird shadows that make it seem to look like a face.

Also, not many scientist belive that the face is a alien artifact either. The face on Mars is just a ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

The ""Face on Mars"" may seem like it was created by aliens but it was just a coincidence that the natural landform resembled a human face. The shadows around the face make the landform seem like it has a mouth, nose, and eyes but it is just a mesa. In conclusion, the face that was captured on a region on Mars, Cydonia, is in fact a natural landform and was not formed by aliens.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
E8F78F4B5345,"Have you ever heard of the Face on Mars? Do you believe in life on Mars? The Face on Mars was first discovered in 1976, but gained a gargantuan amount of attention in 2001 (paragraph 1). Conspiracy theorists belive that the Face on Mars is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, however this theory is false (paragraph 5). The Face on Mars is a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa (paragraph 12). This can be proven by understanding that Martian mesas are common (paragraph 2); realizing that in the 2001 photo if something was near the Face, NASA would have been able to see it

(paragraph 11); and acknowledging the fact that the Face on Mars resembles natural structures on Earth (paragraph 12).

First, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because Martian mesas are common. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh,"" (paragraph 2). The fact that Martian mesas are common makes the idea of the face on Mars being a natural martian Mesa more logical. This is because there are more natural landforms called Martian Mesas on Mars than just the Face.

In addition, the Face on Mars in a natural landform because in the 2001 NASA photo, if there was Martian life people would have been able to see it (paragraph 11). ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" (paragraph 11). ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" (paragraph 11). This means that no matter what was near the Face on Mars during the photo, people would have been able to see what it was.

Finally, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because it resembles natural landforms here on Earth. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West,"" (paragraph 12). The Face on Mars is quite similar to the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho (paragraph 12). The fact the Face on Mars is resemblant to natural landforms on Earth makes it more understandable that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. This is because this lets people know that these types of natural landforms are possible, and that they are even common.

Conspiracy theorists may say that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars , and that NASA would rather hide this evidence (paragraph 5). However, in the 2001 photo of the Face there was no other evidence of life on Mars (paragraph 11). Also, the Face is considered a mesa which are very common on Mars (paragraph 3).Therefore these peoples' theories are not true.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is definitely a natural landform. This is because it is considered a Martian mesa which are common around Cydonia (2). Also, the Face on Mars can be justified as a natural landform because if their was any Martian life located near the Face on Mars during the 2001 NASA photo, people would have been able to see it and tell what it was. Finally, the Face on Mars is a natural landform because it resembles natural landforms here on Earth.  ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
49858334DCCB,"The Face on Mars is very interesting. For many years people have thought it was aliend created. But our photographs clearly show the Face on Mars is not alien created because we have the best cameras we could get, but in 1998 they had the best cameras they could get but they were very weak, and the Face is a natural landform.

In 1998 the cameras they had were very weak they weren't like are cameras today. They are only fourty three meters per pixel which is not a lot. The cameras also captured shadows, so that interfeared with the picture and could make it look like something else. Also the cameras were weak and not very strong.

The Face on Mars is also just a natural landform, formed by the winds and rocks and the planet moving. It's also a big rock which is in the shape of an oval which is probably why people think it was alien created. Also the shadows were there because of how weak the cameras were in 1998. The landform the rock formation is called is a mesa.

Also in 2001 we had way better cameras than in 1998. Are cameras were stronger. They also had less pixels per frame. The pixels per frame were 1.56 which is great. The camera also zoomed in and could see the Face on Mars close up. The camera also took a nice clear photo rather than the one in 1998.

Because our photographs show you that the Face on Mars is a mesa. We concluded that it is not an alien created face. The image can clearly show you how it looks and that there is no face at all.         ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Yes, I understand it's' a planet we haven't been on yet don't you get that, they could have perfectly normal things just like the Earth that happen every day. Do you understand now?

No?, well on April 5, 1998, when Mars GLobal Surveryor flew over Cydonia for the first time and the MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharer than the origina Viking photos. It is a real landform that was caused by natural things that happen, it was no alien monument. It is very hard to get to the face in space because our teams have to go different places, we have to look at different things.

I see your point of view though, I get that MOC could have gotten the picture wrong, but you see it was ten times as sharper than it had been years before. Yes, it was cloudy to and that could have caused some major differnces comapred to when it is sunny. The ""alien markings could have been hidden by haze"", you never know though, but we don't make it over the face very often, it's hard to get a better view from it.

The picture could have been photoshopped to make it look different, I know its in the late ninety's but it wen tto a Jet Propulsion Lab where the face started to apppear into a face. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common arounf Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptain Pharoh. It was a good way to engage the public attraction to Mars. It became an icon in mocies, books, talk shows, it was every where for 25 years. Many scientists believed it was important to NASA and very few believed it was an alien artifact, after eighteen long years the Vikining mission was over.

Do you believe me now when I say that aliens didn't create this face on Mars? It is very posible that they did but, not very likely that they did. You have to look at the facts that it might actually be a natural landform, this argument could go either way but again look at the facts and how we got a ten times sharper look at it and how Mars works, it could work the same as Earth and we don't consider Earth to have aliens on it, we don't blame aliens on our land features. Every planet is different and Mars could turn out to have storms and earthquakes and tornados just like we do on Earth, just remember that next time you think that aliens are real, look at all the facts, ALL the facts and then make your decision.

The first fact that tells us that it was not aliens is, scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth.""

""it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

Those were some facts that tell us that aliens didn't have nothing to do with the Face on Mars. It was just an illusion. It made people wonder if there was life on Mars or if there use to be an ancient civilzation on Mars. But, in the end it was just a rock formation.

People saw the picture of the Face on Mars and assumed it had to do with aliens since it looked so much like a face. But, its best to not assume something before you have strong facts to back it up.

When the public got the photo though, most people thought that it was created by aliens, without any evidence.

Even when the Mars Global Surveyor snapped the natural landform, people weren't satisfied. The Face on Mars was taken during the winter on parts of Earth. Because parts of Earth was in winter during the picture taking, Mars was cloudier than normal. People thought that because of the clouds, important alien like features could of been hiden.

A mesa is a naturally occuring rock formation, that is found on Mars and Earth. This ""face"" on mars only looks like a face because humans tend to see faces wherever we look, humans are obviously extremely social, which is why our brain is designed to recognize faces.

As exciting as it would be to discover living beings on mars, there is no evidnece today that would support that theory. Here at NASA, we have been debating this topic for more than thirty years.

When analyzing a digital image, you can dicern things 3 times larger than the actual pixel size. If aliens had created the Face, there would be some kind of marking that the aliens would have made. On our 2001 trip to the big red planet, we used our best cameras with their absolute maximum resolution. The images that we took showed no sign of any martian markings. This proves that aliens could not have created the Face on Mars.

Here on Earth we have many different types of landforms. One of which looks very similar to the Face on Mars. This landform is called a Mesa. These landforms here weren't created by living beings. They were created by natural causes, like erosion. So, since the landforms here weren't made by creatures, why would the landform on Mars have been made by creatures?

FFC9E875E1EA,"The date is May 24, 2001 and twenty-five years ago we found something that left both NASA and I speechless. They say that this face was created by Aliens however they are totally wrong. NASA says otherwise that it's just natural landform. The most logical reason is the natural landform, because we haven't had any evidence of aliens being real. Therefore I argue that its just a natural landform and not in any form made by an alien.

First of all, we have no proof of aliens whatsoever. No one has proved that they exist, or that they are real. So why do they think its aliens, when it could've just been a natural landform. Things like these happen all the time, our Earth just happens to make things like these. People are actually beliveing that aliens are real, when really they don't have proof.

Second of all, how would the aliens know how to create it. If to say if they even are real. How would they create it, there aren't any tools on Mars. They wouldn't know what they were making, they would have no idea. The face just happened to be a natural landform, it was not created by aliens. Along with they have no proof ""aliens"" did this.

Third of all, why would they even do this. If they did happen to do it , they didn't even mean too. Because they haven't seen a face so they wouldn't know how to make it. Aliens are not real, if they were it'd be everywhere all over the news. People would be so excited and although going to space is a risk many people would do it. Just to go see the ""aliens"", but no one has proved they are real. Therefore, NASA will stand correctly. The face is just a natural landform.

In conclusion, NASA is correct. There is no proof of aliens, and even if there was the slightest chance to having proof. Aliens wouldn't even have meant to do it. They have never seen a face, so why would they just do this. Natural landforms happen all the time. But this one just happened to be spotted by NASA. NASA always seems to be correct on their stats because they do so much research, unlike the other who just suggest that its an alien.

04F277F6562D,"Was the Face on Mars really created by Aliens? Or was it just a very unusual rock formation, even for Mars? Well, the answer is no, it was just a natural landform. This giant rock formation, which stretches for about two miles from end to end, isn't uncommon at all. Actually, it is a mesa which just has shadows that cast on it a certain way, which makes it look exactly like a face.

I know what you might be thinking. How could it only be a natural landform? It looks exactly like a face, so it must have been created by something or someone. Well, there are actually plenty of reasons why it is just a normal landform with unusual shadows. For example, the Face was found in an area of Mars called Cydonia. Cydonia is actually known for its common Martian Mesas. This means that it isn't too shocking that it is natural.

Don't get me wrong, a face is a pretty rare and unusual thing for a mesa to look like. Even though this one has strange shadows that give it features of a face, it is still just a mesa. After multiple pictures that were taken of the Face, the one taken on April 5, 1998 was the first one to fully reveal that the Face was indeed just a natural landform. Even though the picture clearly showed that the Face wasn't a man-made structure, some people still weren't convinced. They said that the picture was taken on a cloudy winter day, so many skeptics thought that maybe there were alien markings that were just hidden by haze.

No matter what people believed after they saw the picture taken in 1998, the picture taken on April 8, 2001 was the one that proved to the skeptics that the Face was a naturally occurring landform. Since the picture was taken on a cloudless day the next time around, there were no excuses for those who thought the Face was made by aliens. This picture actually showed that the Face was a martian, and it was about the same size as a butte or a mesa. Buttes and mesas are landforms that are commonly found in the western regions of the United States.

There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end. ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
C6770481EA55,"On May 24, 2001, scientists took their third photo of what had seemed to be a Martian Mesa, which had seemed to not look much like a human using their 3D camera to take a photo of it.

Look, as someone who's been a scientist for my whole life, and only researching on Mars features, I think I would know if there were any aliens on Mars. There have been a few signs of volcanic activity, and volcanoes on earth have formed something the exact same height. So I believe that a random volcanic activity is what has caused this Martian Mesa.

Besides, on April 8, 2001, it was proven by other scientists besides me that said it was a mesa, and there is on in in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Which is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa abount the same height as the face on Mars.

So if you really think that there is aliens on mars that created that then you are just absolutely crazy.

I have been researching mars my entire life and have found no tracks of an alien species, because if I had, I would have told you about it the second I knew. So if you really want to know what caused this Mesa, it was volcanic activity.                   ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
357082F57A94,"As you may know many people believe that a aliens have created this ""face"". I am here to inform you that it is not. First of all if aliens did create it w ewould have seen some in the picture/s, secondly there just isn't any/enough evidence to prove the accuisation, and lastly we, as NASA have plenty of evidence that this was not created by such cretures.

First of all there is not way that this face was created by living creatures. If they did we would have evidence like seeing forms of some type of homes or just the creatures themselves should have shown up but indeed none did.

Like in the passage ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it includes ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" But in fact there was nothing like this noticable in the close up photograph. The text also includes ""that it was a natural land form. No monument at all.""

Secondly, people with these conspiracys have little to no evidence that there could be any living life on face/mars. They wouldn't stop with their theories so NASA took it into consideration and went out there again, even though it is beyond hard to find it.

But it was on a sunny day. Still, there was no sign of living creatures nor aliens. However In the passage it states ""Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-Evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" Which I could see why some people would believe that NASA would want to hide amazing information like that. They could think that the people of Earth are not ready to quite that out yet. Then again thats just a bunch of non-sense. If scientist did find another place where living creatures could live, that would be a big discovery. Too big to even hide.

Lastly NASA has a lot more evidence to prove that it is jsut a natural landform other than a hidden alien planet. Like one thing from the article is ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illision of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors believed it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" Also the author includes ""Scientist figured it was just another Matian mesa, common enough around Cydona, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like a Egyptain Pharaoh."" So there is much more evidence to comply with NASAs theroies than the conspiracys.

In conclusion its pretty obvious that this is just a natural formation made to just look like a human face. The evidence makes it a clear choice. So this ""face"" is just a landform and we all have to come together and learn how to accepted what it gives us because no matter what its not like we can change it.

That's really the only thing that makes it so special is its shape. We have proof, we have photos, good photos, extrordinary photos of this, and they prove that it is just a landform. We even have these things on Earth. The only thing that makes this so special is its shape. If it weren't shaped like that, people wouldn't even give it a second thought.

Also don't you think that if it were created by aliens we'd have more proof? All we have is a weird shaped landform? That's all we have and we see them all the time. Erosion that's what made your face on Mars.

932DF539092B,"In 1976, a NASA Mars Globe surveyor called Viking 1 took a picture of an area on Mars that looked like a face. Although some believe the Face was created by aliens, I believe it is a natural landform because the pictures provide visual evidence, it would prove there is life on other planets, and it would bring in money for NASA.

NASA has taken 3 pictures. The first one taken in 1976 looked most like a face, but NASA said that it was the planet's ""unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" A second picture was taken on April 5, 1998 that was ten times sharper than the original picture taken by Viking 1. Web surfers were dissapointed to see a natural landform. The unsatisfied viewers claimed that the whispy clouds hid the alien markings on the Face. April 8, 2001, on a cloudless summer day, they took a picture with each pixel spanning 1.56 meters compared to the previous 43 meters per pixel. The new picture revealed exactly what NASA claimed the Face to be, a mesa.

The discovery of life outside of Earth would be exciting. It would provide a chance to exchange scientific knowlege and possibly food or animals. It could also reveal new technologies that could put the world years further than it would be without this help. This excange could change both planets for the better and improve the lives of all species. NASA wouldn't pass up this chance to better the planet.

Some conspiracy theorists may claim, ""The Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA wold rather hide."" This is untrue because the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization because it would bring in more money. This could be spent on new technology that could lead to new discoverys in space.

This proves that the Face on Mars was not caused by aliens. It is a natural landform that is claimed to look like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, which is about the same height as the Face on Mars. If an alien civilazation were discovered, though, we would not pass up the opportunity to change both our world and the aliens' world for the better. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
BE43251A1D82,"The Face

Some people belevie that the landform is a face, but they need to face the facts. The face is that hte ""face"" is just shadows on a landform. NASA has discovered that the ""face"" is like a butte or mesa on earth which are landforms common around the American West. In 1998 NASA captured photos that revelad that it was just a natural landform, and in 2001 using the camera's highest resoluton on a clear day the photo comfires this. Some people might say that NASA is trying to hide the fact that there is alien life on Mars, but they need to look at the fact that NASA would love that and would benefit form finding alien life. All together NASA has the evidence to suppor the fact the the ""face"" is just a landform.

First off, NASA has discovered that the ""face"" is just a butte or mesa commonly found in the American West. In the article it states, ""'It reminds me moost of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,'says Garvin"". This shows that NASA's cheif scientist for it's Mars Exploration Program knows it is just like a butte or mesa. This means that a person who sees things like this on a daily basis knows that it is just shadows making a land form look like something else. If a cheif scientist knows that it is just a landform than that means that we should have no problem understanding what it is.

Secondly, in 1998 NASA captured photos that it was just a natural landform. NASA was able to look at the pictures of the same area and tell that the ""face"" wasn't created by aleins, but was just a ""freak of nature"". In the text it states ""Michael Malin and his Mars Obiter Camera tteam snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photo"". This shows that the picture in 1998 was much mre clear and that shadows caused the ""face"" on Mars. The original camera used by the origianl Viking team cannot compare to the one used in 1998. The original photo that showed the face happened because of a horrible camera and shadows. With this evidence about the camera it confirms that the ""face"" is just a landform.

Lastly, people complained that the photo in 1998 didn't show all of the landform because of the clouds in the wasy, so in 2001 on a clear summer day Malin's team captured a new picture. The text reads, ""'Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution"". This shows that the team took the best photo on the best conditions possible and once again proved that the ""face"" is a landform. Malin who is a professional took two pictures that prove that the ""face"" is not a face at all yet, a natural landform that looked like a face from the shadows. With the evidence from the maximum resolution camera it is easy to see that the ""face"" is a land form.

On the other hand, some people say that NASA is hiding the fact that there is alien life on Mar's. These people have absolutly no evidence to support that claim. NASA is struggeling with budget cuts would have mush more funding for finding alien life so that atomaticaly throws out the possibilty of NASA iding alian life. The consporacy theorists also have no evidence to support their claim. NASA has taken multiple photos that show that the ""face"" is just a landform like a butte or mesa (which are most common in the American West). With all of the information pointing the other way consiparcy theorists have nothing to go on to support their wild claim.

All in all, the evidence only supports that the ""face"" is just a natural landform. The ""face"" resembels a butte or a mesa, and NASA has taken multiple high quality pictures that prove that it is just a landform. Although somepeople might disagree, the ""face"" is just a simple landform and will look the same way for years to come.",6,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

I'll tell the person that thinks that the Face being created by aliens by saying that how will the Face be created by aliens if they would make more of those faces. We humans make building and later on make better or different than before and do think they should have made it bigger or different than before because it has been 25 years since that Face has been there and mothing has change from it but only of how we took the picture. The Face from paragraph 5 shows the face and looks like it had a nose, mouth and eyes from the picture. I can support all of this details from telling you that in paragraph that it said that "" NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possilbe landing sites for its sister ship,"" the reason I told you this is because if the spacecraft was taking photos of the planet then it could of took a photo of an alien or other more of the Face. They been circling the planet to take the photos in 1976, 1998 and 2001 they done this and they never seen the alien or more Faces.

I did the introduction, body and conclusion to the essay and made sure if I put of what to be sure to include in this essay.

Although there are many consperacy theorys, all have been proven wrong becasue it is just a heap of martian material. These theorys have been proven wrong by the pictures, the fact that the shadows give it the charectaristics of a face, and the reason it is not photographed much is not the Goverment, and N.A.S.A hiding proof of alien life. It is simply the fact that we do not pass the face often since 1976 when we first glimpsed the face, Alien existance theorys have spiraled into being both well know, and well conceived. The only problem with these ideas are that the pictures do not support those ideals. There are clear pictures that with out a doubt show no strange markings, or proof of an alien race. These picyures just show it how it is, A Messa.

Furthermore the face is just a large hill. The shadows, of some of the crevaces give off the apperance of being humanoid. Charectaristics such as eyes, nose, and even a mouth appear,but it simply a trick of the light.

As for the people who say Nasa is just ""covering up"" the fact that alien exist or have existend, are simply mistaken. The reason the Face is not often photographed is because we just do not passover the Face often. There is no alien life on Mars, or at least none that are affiliated with the Face.

In conclusion through the hard facts, and evidence of pictures, the shadows mistaken for human features, and the fact that our rover, and satalites just simply do not passover the Face often, support the fact the Face was not created by an alien race.

Aliens could not have made this because they do not exist, it would take a long time to make anything that scale, and it would take them years to make.

Aliens could not have made the face becasue they do not exist. This is why NASA thinks this. Aliens would have to have good construction and excavtion equipment. As you would say, they don't need that stuff they just built it. However, there is no physicaly possible way that they could have made it without the equipment.

Aliens could not have made the face because it would take a long time to make anything that scale. Here is why they could not have done it. They don't have the capablities to make anything like the face on Mars. The people that think otherwise would say that it isn't a natural land form. However, NASA scientist where comparing it to other natural landforms. That is why NASA thinks that it is impossible for the aliens to make anything to that scale.

Aliens could not have made the face becasue it would take to long. Here is why NASA is proving facts. This is not possible in any shape, way, or form because it would take over 300 years to do so. You would say that the aliens just bulit it as we bulid buliding today. But, they would have to have constrcution workers working every single day for this to happen and that is why NASA says it is impossible. Together that is why I do not think is is possible.

E71BD2DCF4E4,"The Face was not created by aliens because there is no evidence on The Face to be able to test to see if it was created from an alien. We have searched The Face to find out to see if The Face was made by aliens, and the face was not crafted from aliens because we have not seen a single artifact, text, and/or any symbols near this landscape.

Since we have not seen an artifact in the landscape we could tell that there were no aliens near this area. Since we have not seen an artifact, yes, they could have maybe known that they dropped it and culd have gone searching for it, but then what about the other aliens they could have dropped any crafting utensils at the sight.

Now if there were any text in english then the text could have been from a fellow american space travelar, now if it was made by an alien the text wouldn't be in english, but there is no text in the sight because we haven't seen any so therefore it was not made from an alien, now if it were to be made from an alien they would have text or symbols on The Face because they wouldn't just leave it like that and then walk away. They would have put text or symbols.

I also think aliens are a myth because we would already have facts and we have already told everyone. I bet someone just made up a story and told people they were real.

While NASA is taking pictures of places to land on Mars they spot something. They spotted a face on Mars they don't know how or what it's made of. A few days later NASA unveiled the image so everyone could see the face. It got so popular people started calling it the ""Face on Mars"" and it became a pop icon. It also starred in everyhting from Hollywood films, books, magazines, radiotalk shows, and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years (1-5).

Few scientists belived the face was alien artifact. Jim Garvin took a couple of pictures of it as soon as they could. Finally the team took pictures that were ten times sharper than the original ones. Not everyone was satisfied with the pictures they took. It was hard getting a good shot of the face because Mars had seasons and when they took the pictures it was winter there. With a lot of pwople not liking the picture they needed to try again but when. When will the Face appear again to get that perfect picture (6-9).

After they took the pictures they thought they were never going to get another chance to get better pictures. Then all of that changed on April 8, 2001 when there was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. All they had to do was roll the scapecraft 25 degrees to center the Face and take the picture.

He also states his rule ""As a rule of thumb, oyu can discern thiings in a digital image 3 times bigger han a pixel size.""

People might argue that its an alien who put the face on Mars but we have no evidence that aliens are real.

To start of this discusion of the so called ""face"" on mars I would like to tell you is that it is not at all a face. What it is just a landform that has formed to look so simular to a face or moument of the martians. But mars is like earth it forms things just like it so what it really is is just a couple of rocks and thier shadows to form a face like thing.

On the other hand is how do we know this. Well ever since the discovery scientist have been researching and taking more pictures and looking at it a whole lot closer. What we came up with is that like I said before a landform on mars but some say where wrong.

Another reason that bothers me is how people think its a conspiracy theory. many, many, many people think ""oh its just nothing but the martians"" but no this is just a mesa but since people say that stuff we had to prove them wrong. So what NASA did was they built a big camera to take pictures of it to prove it was a big rock which it was a huge budget problem for them but they still did it.

People may argue by saying so if it is something simular to earth then that means martians were here to and then they got bord of the place they so they left and went somewhere else. then they built this big face of maybe a king or emporer or something and they are hiding from us.

Before spotting this landform, NASA had no further information on alien's on Mars. Also, the camera that the team used was at its' maximum resolution, meaning that they wouldn't miss a thing. Lastly, the team could enlarge the picture three times bigger, so they could see things located on the ground.

Before the team at NASA spotted the ""Face on Mars"" they hadn't heard anything about there being a possibility of aliens on Mars. Therefore, I think It's highly doubtful that this could happen.

Although the first look that the team took was a little hazy, they went back with a higher quality camera, which they set at the maximum resolution. With this camera it would be very unlikely for them to missunderstand an alien creation as a landform.

Lastly, on top of having a high quality camera, the team could enlarge the picture up to three times bigger. This helped them so much that it allowed them to see things as close as the ground. After this, it was positive they couldn't miss a thing.

Considering that before the NASA team spotted the ""Face on Mars"" there was no further evidence of aliens living on Mars.

F6D999ED97B8,"Some people think that the Face on Mars was created by aliens, which is anaccurate. Mars obviously has alot of natural disasters on its planet almost daily. These natural disasters could've made the surface into a face like shape by how much damage was caused to the enviroment. Mars is full of red bolders that could of been tossed around by the storms and left marks or craters in the surface. I have a little more detail to my theory.

First, there is no sign of alien life on Mars. I'm not saying there's no sign of life on Mars period, there is sign of water being on that planet and possibaly plants as well. It's just that there is no sign of a species on that planet, not even fossils of the so called ""aliens"". If there was any aliens on Mars what material would they have to make any form in the ground. Aliens probably wont have any exsplosives on their planet with no material to make it with.

Next, if there were any aliens why would they make a face on the ground. It has no meaning to it, it might just be a ruler/king or something to their people. I dont think aliens would want to put a face on the ground that barely looks like a face. The enviroment made the form because the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho was made by our enviroment, so it can be a caquensadence. That's a compairason that leads me to believe the enviroment of Mars made that face on the surface.

Then, there are scientific facts and quotes from NASA that supports lots of evidence. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter revealed that the Face was a natural landform. And added that ""there was no alien monument after all."". The team snapped ten photos of the lanform that was sharper then the first camera of Viking 1.

In conclusion, I think that my theory is both accurate and logical. I took edvice from people who did their research on this topic. The evidence that i took were both believable and not crazy theories from ordinary citizens. These are my reasonings on why i think that the Face was made by Mars enviroment.

243950E747B0,"In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft captured a picture that looked like the resemblence of a human face. NASA showed the picture to the public and it definitely drew attention to Mars. Some conspiracy theorists believe that the Face Viking 1 found is evidence of life on Mars, but NASA later came out and said that the face was actually just a landform, a mesa. I believe that the Face is a natural landform because, a clearer picture confirms this, it is similar to landforms of the American West, and NASA wouldn't hide that life was found on Mars becuase it would benefit them.

The Face was not created by aliens, becuase a clearer picture taken in 2001 shows it's just a landform. In the article it states, ""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa."" NASA used their best equipment to make sure they would be accurate when discovering what the Face really was. Also, in the article it states, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" Sometimes when you see something at first it looks like something odd, but when you take a closer look it turns out to be something ordinary; that's what happened in this situation.

Another reason, why the Face wasn't created by aliens, is becuase it's just like any other landform. In the article it states, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin."" Like I said previously, the Face turned out to be a landform, and the landform itself isn't something specatacular, it's just an ordinary landform. It is something that is common, that just formed like the mountains and plateaus in North America today.

Finally, a formation created by aliens would benefit NASA, so why would they try to hide that. If it was made by aliens and there really was life on Mars, wouldn't NASA be excited and telling the public about it, since it would promote their company? The answer is yes, they would, which is why I believe they are telling the truth that it is just a butte or mesa. The article states, ""Some poeple think that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilation on Mars."" This proves my point that NASA would be be thrilled and want to tell everyone about life on Mars, if there really was.

In conclusion, I think the Face found on Mars was just simply a natural landform. There is more evidence that proves this than there is that proves it was made by aliens. Taking a closer look at it you can clearly tell it is just a landfrom, it is similar to landforms of the American West, and proof of life on Mars would benefit NASA, so they wouldn't hide that information. This shows why I believe the Face found on Mars is just a landform, and was not created by aliens.",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
C92DE2759732,"In1998, new high resolution images and 3D altimetry from NASA's Mars Global Survey, a spacecraft revealed the a face on mars. Some believe that the face was created by aliens, others including NASA, and myself believe that it is just a natural landform. NASA research states in the article that it is just a huge rock formation, and there is common landforms around the American West. Also web surfers get dissapointed when what they been waiting for is really just a land formation.

When NASA unveiled the image for all to see they caption the picture ""huge rock formation."" They also stated ""human face..formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" They also state ""huge rock formation that resembles a human head."" This shows that NASA believes and told the public that what some think is created by aliens is really just a natural landform.

Similar pictures have been found common around the American West, that look just like the ""face"" on Mars. The article states that ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa--landforms common around the American West."" Garvin states ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the snake River Plain of Idaho."" This shows that

NASA compares the face to comman landforms already found and explains they are very similar.

Thousand of anxious web surers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, only to reveal a... natural landform. They text states ""there was no alien monument after all."" The text also states that ""web surfers who waited so long for what they thought was going to be great was really just land."" This shows that the web surfers where disapointed in there find, and there hopes not becoming realality.

However, those who say it is created by aliens disaprove with the fact that the ""face"" is just natural landforms. The text states ""but not everyone was satisfied. The face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winte in April '98--a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Also the text goes on to state ""some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-- evidence that NASA would rather hide."" These examples from the text show and help prove why people belive they were created by aliens and isnt a natural landform.

So as you can see NASA and myslef belive that the face is simply just a natural landform for many reasons proven. NASA states its just a huge rock, web surfers where dissapointed in there findings, and similar landforms have been found that match up to the face. Little do people know, the face is actually just a natural landform and not a alien creation like some hoped to find. Alien creation? Silly nonsence. Natural Landform?

C52F36371962,"As a NASA scientist, I believe that the "" face "" on Mars is a natural formation. I dont believe that aliens could have formed this. During my work, I have discovered many different ways to make you believe that the face is natural.

The scientists that work with NASA, such as myself, have found many different reasons as to why the formation looks like a face. During our time photographing Mars, we have been equiped with much better quality cameras, which help us see things better on Mars itself. Over the years, we have discovered that when you use a higher quality Mars Global surveyer (MGS), the "" face "" no longer looks like a face. Still some people didn't believe us the first time we got photographs of the land mark, so went and did it again. This time, we made sure that there weren't any clouds that could default the photos of Mars. What we found out by looking at these photos is the the facial features are simply just shadows. Take the eyes for example, while photographed from the middle of the land mark, there is a shadow being created by the sun. From this angle, the sun makes the land mark seem as if it had eyes. The "" mouth "" is simply just a hole in the land mark, which looks like a mouth while photographed from the middle of the land mark. There is no way aliens could be the cause of a natural piece of land on Mars.

Now that you understand what the "" Face "" actually is, I hope you dont still think aliens were the cause of it. There is scientific proof that it is a natural piece of land that just so happened to form on Mars.   ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
8FE284BA4D25,"We have created a face on the surface of our planet. Doesn't that sound stupid, I mean if there is intellagent life out there why would they waste there time puting a face on a planet. That face is nothing but a mountain or rock formation that looks like a face.

First off the area the probe was flying over and taking pictures of was know to have mesas. Like the article had said at in paragraph two "" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia."" Which is where the probe was flying over. Most scientist believe it is just a landform with the face looking structure.

Next when NASA got another probe into space to take better pictures, just to show the people like you who think it was made by aliens that it is in fact just a rock formation. They took another picture and people still didn't believe them so depsite how hard it is to position it to take another picture they did it anyway and it looked nothing like a face, But more like a mountain.

Lastly most of the stuff made up about the face on mars. when they released the photo like it said in the article ""it stared in a hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows--even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years!"" It's just made up by people to either sell more stuff in there gift shop or store and or make movies and books. Because who would want to watch a movie about the extroudanary mountain on mars. They would have to make false info about it and say it was made by aliens so it would sell more.

You may say that that probe is floating very far away from space how do you know there is not any evidence of life down there? Well yes It is very far away but the picture was taken in maxium resilution. Each pixel spans 1.56 meters so each pixel in that photo spaned 1.56 meters on the planet so you would be able to see anything that would have show alien life down there.

So yes it was nothing but a mountain that looked like a face. Next time you look at somthing that looks like it could be alien in outer space don't believe movies or novels belive the scientist they know what there doing and know what is for the better of human knowledge not some persoon trying to make some money by saying that aliens made it so you would buy it.

Our caption noted a huge rock formation wich made it look like a human face. Some authors reasoned that it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars by saying that aliens had created that human face on Mars.

We sent out a Global Surveyor to see and take a picture of the ''face"". It arrived at the Red Planet in Sept. 1997 18 years after the Viking mission ended. It would get a photo as soon as It can get it. When Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Mihael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. When they took the photo thousands of web surfers were waiting to see the image. When they saw the image they saw that it was only a land form. There was no alien monument after all.

As you can see if there where objacts in this picture like a house or something else you would be able to see it on this picture.

People think that the Face is created by aliens because the rock formation looked like an Egyptian Pharaoh; however, it is not. Arguements about the Face have been going on since the first picture was released. I'm here to tell you that the Face is 100% a natural landform.

When people argue about the miraculous rock formation, they say that there was or is life on Mars and that the aliens built the Face because it appears to have a mouth, nose, and eyes.

Some questions we get a lot are ""How did it get there?"", ""Why does it have a human face?"", and ""How did it naturally get prominent face features of a human?"" We do not 100% know how the Face got its human feature, but through all of the tests we have done on Mars, there are no aliens found and that the Face is just a fantasic natural made wonder of space.

B3F8E0CCBC1A,"In this prompt I will be writing an argumentive essay about comparing the two ideas from the story i read ''Un masking the face on mars"". The two two sides of this argument is wether the face isthink it is alien remains or natural landform. I personly think it is just an natural landform.

Why i think it is a natural landform is because there is no other sins of life so if there was aliens on mars why would they left a big face carved on a rick insted of something more alien like. Also like Garvin said the face also is very simular to a butte or mesa and the hase details are probly just weird shaperd errosion patterns that over time have come to look like the modern human face.

The face could also posibley be an alien artifact for more specsece to find. Much resuch has been done on mars to see if other human life is on it due to its closeness to the goldy locks zone withc is a obital zone that human life could potetionly live in like earth for example. The NASA teams have even found frozen water on Mars and that is one of the basic needs for animals considering we are over 70 percent water.

It is much more likly the face is just a natural land form though because of how much the size and shape resemple a butte or mesa from the mid west. Plus they're is more then one formation lik this this happens to be the only one is the shape of a htman face. You also have to consider they're is many natural formations who look like other thingd on earth.

In conclution It is a likly chance that the face is nothing more or less then a natural land form who happens to look like the modern humsn face, but we should not dought becuase no one knows for certain.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
B1869E878E3F,"In this article we will be talking about how and why this landform on mars was not created by aliens on mars. We will be talking about how it is just and oddly shaped landform naturaly created,why people think it was created by alien life on mares and how it could've been made on mars.

This oddly shaped landform on mars is just an odd mountain of the rusty soil on mars that happens to resemble a face of egyptian pharaoh that looks like the monuments that we find in western america to day. The face on mars resembles a face because of shadows frome other large landforms nearby or could be just a verry odd landform that looks like a face of some sort.

People think the landform of a face might of been created by aliens from the planet mars. How do we know that it is created by aliens how do we even know of life on the planet mars. The planet mars is supposed to be a very rusty dusty planet and is very cold at night and decently warm in day. If this was created by aliens we would need proof or sightings of the aliens that have created this for it to be considered true.

This myterious landform may have been created by heavy winds of dust to form and odd face on the side of top of some hill or mountain on mars. It could just be shadows from other big landmarks nearby this one that has cast its shadow over this one that could resemble a face. Or if there is alien life on mars then there might be just a small possibility of this have been created by aliens just to get our attention to visit there planet and if that is the case then we shall have to explore it to see and come to a conclusion of how the mysteirous landform was created to begin with than we might agree to that aliens created it.

I think that this landform on mars was just created by heavy winds and shadows from other bigger mountains nearby this one and happend to cast it shadow over this one to resemble a face on this one that is what it think.

It even says the when this picture was taken it was a cloudy day ""it was winter in April '98 a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.""

The picture could just be some dust that has moved around a bunch of time at had made a face figure out of the dust and debre. The pictures also look different over time which was probably the dust and sand moving it all around. Plus there are really strong and heavy storms almost every single night at mars. so the dust, sand, and rocks are flying every where so that can cause disfiguer to anything.

2D1749D9898F,"The face of Mars could not be created by aliens. It is a land form created by the conditions of mars and looks like a face only by coincidence. Mesa's are common in this area of Mars and there are many others like this one just without the same shadows which makes the appearance of a human's face.

Out of so many different land forms in Cydonia why should this be any different. In the second paragrapgh of the article, it stated that the Cydonia region is known for its buttes and mesas. The face of Mars is just another mesa no different that any other one except for its unique shadows. It is strange to see a formation on an supposedly uninhabited planet that depicts a ""human"" face. Espescially when no human has ever set foot on the planet of Mars before. But at the same time, that is all the more reason to believe that this is nothing more that a weird coincidence since no person has ever been there.

To conspiracy theorists dismay, this strange landform is nothing more than martian butte or mesa and a weird coincidence. It is an interesting formation that stumped and puzzled scientests all over the world. But we now know the formation is not anything that will reveal alien lifeforms or alien activity.

84613C386C66,"The face on Mars really is just a landform. I've seen the landform before on our very own home planet. My family and I were going to Grand Canyon for a vacation. Life had been rough so we decided we deserved to see the country a little bit. Upon arriving in Arizona, I saw hundreds of mesas, which are landforms that look like faces. I was petrified at first, until I learned they were merely landforms. The first time I saw the alledged ""Face on Mars,"" I knew it was merely a landform. I believe the Face is a landform and not an alien figure because it was exaggerated by Hollywood and the media, it would be better for NASA if it were an alien life form, and there are already lots of similar landforms on Earth.

Hollywood, its the home of the media. Of course the media will do anything for views. As soon as they found out about the Face, they jumped all over it. For instance, in paragraph 5, the author quotes, ""The 'Face on Mars' has since become a pop icon."" This implies that it really wasn't a big deal before it started to become popularized. Paragraph 5 also shows us that it starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in magazines, books, radio talk shows, and even was told in checkout lines for 25 years. The Face was an icon of its time, and thus was twisted to seem like an alien figure.

Moving on, why would NASA want to keep an alien a secret? If NASA actually did find an alien, they would want to let the world know so that they'd have more funding. In paragraph 5, we are told that the NASA budget wishes that there was an ancient civivlization of Mars. This proves that it would help NASA pay off debts and would make them more popular in the face of the public. It is also stated in paragraph 7 that Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, had a few words to say.

""We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" Jim said. This exemplifies that NASA knew it was only a landform, but they wanted to take pictures so that the public would pay them more.

A third reason for my believing is that there are already many landforms like this. The landform is called a mesa. As I said earlier, I've seen many of these landforms in Arizona. We are shown in paragraph 7 that when the picture of The face first appeared on a JPL web site, it showed that there was no alien monument, only a landform. This proves to us that sure, if you take a picture from a certain angle, it looks like a face; when you take it from a different angle, it looks like the landform that it is. This is similar to the Man on the Moon. We know that it is just a bunch of craters, making it look like a human figure. In the final section, 12, Garvin states a perfect example.

""'It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,' says Garvin. 'That's a lava dome that take the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This is an excerpt from the passage that demonstrates how the Face is no different from our landforms on Earth.

Some might say that the face is actually an alien monument, and that NASA just doesn't want the public to know. But, what they don't realize is that NASA would benefit from seeing an alien life form. The public would love it, and the money would start rolling in. The author tells us that defenders of the NASA budget actually wish that there was an ancient alien civilization on Mars.

It seems that life gets so boring for people that they make any little thing seem amazing. This is shown through the fact that people made a landform appear as an alien monument. Through all the incomplete theories, I still believe that the Face is purely a landmark. I believe this because hollywood and the media exaggerated it greatly, the discovery of alien life would actually benefit NASA, and there are many landmarks on Earth and Mars that represent the supposed ""Face of Mars.""",6,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

If there truly is or was life of Mars, why would this massive rock be a sign of it? The earlies picture of the face is an extremely low quality and blurry image taken by a really old camera. Even in the picture from 1976, to me it just looks like a rock, which it is. Newer photos show the intricate cracks and molding on the landmass, there's even 3D models showing what it really is. There is absolutely no way this is something created by a living being. Just look at the size of it! Well, I guess you can't tell how big it is from the photos, but it's miles long. There is nothing that could exist with enough power to make something this huge, yet leave nothing behind to show us proof of foreign lifeforms.

Ok, so NASA is saying 25 years ago they noticed something funny that happened at Mars. I think the thing they spotted was aliens. Besides the red stuff the only weird on Mars would be aliens.

In my opinion, I dont think the Face was created by aliens. So far scientist haven't even see aliens in space so if that's the case how could aliens have created the Face. You know humans had to create that one.

I do think there are aliens in space but I don't think they made the Face. Until scientist find out they aliens exist I'm keep thinking that it was a really smart guy. So come on sicentist lets find out if aliens exist.

In the passage it says, ""There was no alien monument after all."" Also how could there be life on Mars. Mars has no oxygen so people can breathe. All NASA wanted to do was ,"" engage public and attract attention to Mars."" also in the text it states that NASA said,"" huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shodows giving the illusionb of eues, nose and mouth.""

The Face on Mars is not real because it is just a natural landform caused by erosion and broken rocks. An example from the text is, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform.""

Secondly another reason the Face is a nautural landfrom is because it is not possible for people to live on Mars. Studies have shown that there is no oxygen on Mars and people can not breathe there. Also the preasure of the gravity on Mars would be too much for a human and could crush their bones and musles. Thirdly, why would the rest of the body not be with the Face. That proves that the Face is just a natural landfrom create by erosion and rocks because if the Face was there on the ground why wouldnt the rest of the body by with the Face.

In conclusion the face is just a natural landfrom becuase NASA have send rovers up to Mars to take pictures of the Face and NASA said themselves,""when the first image appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all. So that is why the Face is just a natural landform.

17948AE7A682,"Have we seen any form of life on Mars so far? No, that's why it's clearly a natural landform. Plus, how do the aliens know what we look like. They could look completely different from us. It just so happens that the natural landform look's like a face.

Why would the aliens spend their time making a two mile long face anyways? These natural landform's are common in Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh. It is indeed interesting and cool to think that it was built by aliens, but it wasn't built by aliens. Don't get me wrong, everyone wishes it was made by aliens, but facts are facts.

In 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over the landmark and got a couple photo's that are ten times better than the 1976 photo's. It was confirmed that the landmark wasn't a face it was just the shadow's that made it look like a face. But of course, skeptics thought the alien markings were hidden by haze. ""It's not easy to target Cydonia"" says Garvin. ""In fact, it's hard work.""(Paragraph 9)

Then, on April 8, 2001, four years after the last photo, another couple of photo's were taken. These photo's were way clearer than the photo's from 1998.

"" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" This is proof that aliens did not make this landform.

As you can see, there is plenty of edvidence that the two mile head is a natural landform. Their is way more convicing stories about this topic. But I hope that my side of the argument conviced you that the landform wasn't built by aliens.         ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
C4B52CBE6186,"The Face is an actual landform, it was not created by aliens. In order for me to prove this to you I need facts, so that it is what the majority of this essay is going to be about. I will also be be telling you how I know that the Face on Mars is a landform. There are many facts as to why the Face on Mars is a landform and I will be sharing all of those that I can find with you.

I will also be telling some other landforms that are similar to the Face. I am citing all of my evidence and facts from the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"".

One of my first claims that the Face on Mars is actually a landform and was not created by aliens is from paragraph three in ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and it states, ""The caption noted a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

At the beginning of that sentence it says ""a huge ROCK formation"" which is telling us that it is actually rock and that it had devolped over time to form into the shape of a face. And that it was not created by aliens because aliens can not create or make rocks.

Another claim that the face is actually a land form and was not created by aliens is that in paragraph twelve is it giving us a very clear and precise meaning that the Face is an landform by telling us that, "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. ""That a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" That is telling us that there are more places in the world that are like the Face on Mars. That also means that if there are more places, then aliens could not have made the Face on Mars because that means it would have had to make all of the other mesas and buttes in the entire universe.

Lastly, my final claim that the face is actually a landform and was not created by aliens is in paragraph seven in the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and that it tells us that, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture tem times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appered on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" At the end of that whole paragraph it tells us that there was no alien monument after all. Which means that the aliens did not create the Face on Mars at all.

In conclusion I know that the Face on Mars is actually a landform and was not created by aliens because of the facts the a have cited from the article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". I have given you very good claims as to why and I really hope that you change your opinion on this topic of matter. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
FBF5936A2053,"The Face of Mars is a natural landform and I'll tell you why. For many years we have been taking pictures and observing it to look at what it really was. We just got a new sattelite and we took the pictures. It's not what most of the media thinks.

The new pictures taken from the spacecraft show that it is clearly a mesa formed rather than an ancient artifact created by extra-terrestrial life. It was formed just like the landform would on earth and the pictures clearly show it's not even a face anymore. Everything adds up to mesa and the thought of ancient artifacts are pointless. There is no life evidence on Mars. You guys are called conspiracy theorists for a reason. The word theory is a guess. This isn't a guess. At NASA we figured out it is a mesa landform and have proof.

That is why you are wrong and no other theory could counter our results. Science facts against a civilian's thoughts, facts win. Science prooves yet another thing on another planet. HD pictures are hard proof that it is a natural landform.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
3CB373309402,"In 1976 a land form was found on Mars that looked very similiar to a human face. Some people's minds immediatly thought that it was from aliens. This would make no sense because there are plenty of forms like this on Mars. Aliens wouldn't build a form that looked like humans. If it was an alien there would be proof, and we would know. This theory is way to far fetched to be the truth because this is just like any other land form on Mars. We have tons of evidence that prooves that it isn't from aliens and the only ""evidence"" the people that think it was the work of aliens have is that it looks like a face. There theory holds no water, yet people still believe it. Just look at the facts.

They discovered the face-looking form on a part of Mars called Cydonia. On Cydonia there are lots of forms called Martian mesas. It was not irregular to find one where they were at. The fact that it looked like a face was just a coincedence. It only looked like a face because of the way it was shadowing. To actually be from aliens all of the messas would of had to come from them because it was just like any other. There is no way that aliens made any of the others. The only reason that this one is believed to be built by them is only because it resembles a face. I'm sure if you looked hard enough you could find another form that resembled something, and then people would think that it was from aliens, but they're not. You can look at clouds and find shapes in them and people don't think aliens made them. Some think that just because it is on another planet that aliens must have made it, but it doesn't mean that at all.

When people first noticed that it looked like a face they immediatly started thinking that aliens were behind it because they thought that it looked like an Egyptian pharoah. How could an alien that lived on Mars know what an Egyptian pharoah looked like? They are a completely different planet, millions of miles away. Even if it is just a regular face, not a pharoah, still how would aliens even know what humans looked like? And, say that they did know what we looked like, still why would they build this land form to look like us and not themselves? It makes absolutly no sense. If it really was aliens they would want to build of themselves, so they get some credit. There is no way they would of made it of a completely different species.

There is nothing special about this form other than the fact that it looks like a face. It is exactly like all the other forms on mars. Conspericy theorists want to say that we, NASA, know that it is from aliens and that we're just trying to keep it a secret. That makes even less sense then saying that aliens created it in the first place! If we could find something that was really built by aliens, that would be tremedously great for us. If we knew that it was built by aliens we would be overwhelmed by excitement, and we would let everyone know about it. The cold hard truth is that it is just like any other form. The fact that it looks like a face makes some people suspicous, and we get that. Who wouldn't want to know that their is life on other planets, I know I would be amazed if it was true, but it isn't. This is just a really cool looking land form, nothing else. Aliens had absolutly nothing to do with it.

When this face shaped land form was found, even the people on the ship wanted to think that it was made by aliens. It would be great for everyone, especially NASA, but they quickly had to come to reality and realize that it was just like the rest, it just had a really interesting shape. Some dreamers still would like to believe that aliens built this land form, but they to need to soon come into reality. There are so many of these forms on Mars already. Aliens wouldn't want to build a land form that looked like a human. If it was from an alien we would know, and we wouldn't keep it from you. All real evidence shows that aliens were not involved what so ever, but some would still like to believe they were. Just look at the evidence, and hopefully you to will see that there is nothing special about it. ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
72880FCDB3AB,"I am Mackenzie Dazzleberry a scientist at

NASA and we has been seeing a figure that looks like a humans head, but I don't like it's that, i think that it is a lanform. The nose could bumps from if people dumped things there or it could be bumps. The eyes could again be waste that people dumped and it formed into bumps or the nose and eyes could be hills on the face.

I also think that the face could be landforms because they are common around the American West and it looks like from the front it looks like a circle but if you look at it from the side it looks like a rectangle. The face could be a landform because we ended up revealing that it was infact a landform.

I belive that the face is a landform because of the shape on the bottom and because from all the pictures we gathered when we put them together they look like a landform, just because the things that look like eyes and a nose doen't mean that it could be an alien, the landform could have bumps or hills that formed from people dumping waste on it or from having hills on it, or it could be dents on it from things stepping, walking, or things falling on it.

C451B6D12DC4,"Have you ever heard of the ""Unmasking the face on Mars"" before? Well people started making accusations before they got a high quality photograph. They though it was a face aliens had made on Mars, that was one of the many accusation made about the face on Mars.

The face on Mars is just a landmark because ""The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 98a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" So there as a big cloudy winter storm when people discovered the face. Well with all the wind blowing it could of just been made of dirt and rocks and everything blowed into one pile and by a cowincidence been made into a face.

Second another reason why the face is just a landmark because right after the winter storm they got ""A 1976 Viking 1 photograph of the Face on Mars."" Before they can go make accusations that go into history you have to have a high quaity picture to prove you are right. They got one picture and that is not enough to solve something in history to start making illogical accusations without evidence.

Finally why the face is just a landmark on mars is because instead of waiting to get a high quality image they waited 3 years to go back to Mars to see it. When they finally did go back to see the face they had a lot better and high quality cameras. So when they arrived back on Mars it was proven that the so called face was just a landmark. A quote in the text that makes everything logical is ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West.""

So there you have it the face on Mars was just a landmark not an alien face.

See before everyone made illogical accusations they did not have a high quality photo and when they first took the photo when it was a cloudy day. NASA is correct because before making accusation they went and got evidence to prove their thoery's.            ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
DC93D8BDE631,"""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" is a hard subject for some people. Not everybody thinks its a natural landform but many scientist do! The ""face"" on Mars could be many things but scientist have evidence that it is a natural landform. In the story it says that the natural artifact is like some landforms in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It also says that few scientist believe the Face was an alien artifact so if it's not that and that have other evidence it has to be a natual artifact.

The Face is very similar to natural artifacts here on Earth. In the story it talks about a place in idaho that is very similar to the Face. It also says it looks very much like a lava dome. Scientist say a place in Idaho that is called Middle Butte looks very similar to the Face. The pictures the very nice camera took of the Face is proof that they do look alike and that it is just a natural artifact.

Not very many scientist believe that the Face is an alien artifact and they back that up with the fact that it doesn't have the features of it. It might look very much like a humans face but they do not believe that. There scientist and they have evidence that it is not human like its just a natural artifact.

Some people might believe that it is a human face and that the face does look like it but no it is a natural artifact. It is a natural artifact because scientist believe that and they have facts to back up there reasoning, for example in the story it talks about how the ""Face on Mars"" was a huge hit to scare people and things like that and then scientist come out and say they have conspiracy theories that the face is not evidence that there is life on Mars.

650A40BBAB6D,"Twenty five years ago we discoved something different on the surface of Mars.

This natrural land form looks just like a human face.

Some people believe that it was created by aliens.

However, that is not true.

There many explanations on how this land form got there, but there is no evidence that claims it was created by aliens.

I am a scientist at NASA and I was one of the people who discovered this land form.

Although some people have very convensing stories as to how that land form got there, it was not made by aliens.

Many people think it is a natrural land form, while others think it was created by aliens.

The team of scienctist that discoved this land have talked about how we think it got there, but one of only logical explanation is that it was hit by a meteror.

Mars has lots of crators on the surface and it is just that.

A crator.

There is no way aliens could have made this land form.

It is over two miles long. For them to make this it would have taken many of hundreds of years.

I personal think that if there are any aliens they would not be an advanced civilization to create something like this.

Another reason why they could have never made this is how would the aliens know what a human face looks like.

This land form is just like they face on the moon, no one made it.

It just showed up after years and years of being hit by meterors and the push and pull of gravity.

Personaly I do not beleive that aliens exist.

There is no evidence that they live on mars, let alone any other planet.

If they do exist I would have no problem with that, but as of right not there is no evidence that they do.

Even though some stories are very convensing, there is no way aliens could have made this land form.

If there was more convensing evidence then I might reconsider my opinion, but as of right now there is no more evidence.

So I will not be reconsidering.

The land form is over two miles long which would be nearly impossible for a very underdeveloped society to create.

Also how would the aliens know what a human face looks like.

Therefore there is no possible way the aliens made that face, it's just a land form.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
DACE5B4CB5D5,"There are many reasons why I think that the face on Mars just a natral land formation. One reason is that where the face is formed there are ofther Martian mesa. That is what made the land look like a face and the shadowing was just right and it makes the eyes, nose and mouth.

My second argument is this. After the MGS had taken the first photo of the face they still needed better pictures. So there was a picture taken on April 5, 1998 that was ten times sharper than the origonal picture. Revealeing that the face is a natural landform. There is no connection of aliens to the face. People still did not want to belive it isn't a real face. This brings me to my final argument about the Mars face.

My last argument is proof. The MGS got close enough to take a second picture. This time the team used the camaras absolute maximum resolution. Which means that you can see pretty much anything that would be around the face. Things like airplains on the ground, shacks, buildings, pyramids, etc. What the picture actully showed was that the face is a landformation. It showed that the face was an equivalent of a butte or mesa. These are a few reasons why I think that the Mars face is just a landformation.    ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Many scientist like me and different people thought it was different things. Like just a regular natural landform in Mars and others think it is a face that a lien had left there to show a icon. We also had a arguent over what it really was. Me as a scientist and other people that thought it was a icon that aliens marked.

I, as a scientist disagree about what many people think it is. I personally think its just a regular natural landmark in Mars. Others think its a icon for something a alien made because its shaped as a face a few scientist believed the Face was an alien artifact. Some people think the face is nonafide evidence of real life on Mars.

As they were taking pictures around Mars they were shocked to see a face on one of the pictures. Scientists didn't take to much consideration aout the face. Thye thought it was just another Martian mesa.

A few days later they released the picture of the face to the world. Since they released the photo it has become a pop icon. It was showed in Hollywood films, books, magazines, and in radio talks. Some people think it the Face is bona flide evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. The people thought they were hiding the fact that life may be on Mars.

On April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera took some photos that were ten times sharper then the ones in 1976. As Michael Malin was taking photos, the world was anxious to see what would be the outcome of the photos. When the photos came out on a website it showed a landform. There was really no alien monument after all.

The Face of Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998. It was a cloudy time of year on the Red planet. Not everyone was satisfied that it was just a landform. Some people say that the alien markings were hidden by all the haze. NASA decided to look aagain at Cydonia in 2001.

On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor went to take another look at the landform. During that little exibition, Malin's team captured an extraordianry photo using the camera's maximun resolution. Each pixel in 2001 spans 1.5 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.

They compared the three photos and came to conclusion that the picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, common landforms around the American West. Garvin said it reminds him most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa, about the same height as the Face on Mars.

Many people think it was a human face that aliens created, but surely enough it isn't. As a scientist from NASA I know for sure it is definitely not. NASA went into further detail with this ""Face"". We looked further into the face just to show people that this is not a face created by aliens.

Further more we found it was just another Martian mesa, common in Cydonia. Since the face was becoming popular, being in movies, magazines, radio shows, and books we had to prove that we are right. As a result in 2001 NASA took a even closer and more clear picture of this face on Cydonia. It showed that it was just illusions making the mesa look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose. Making this mesa look like a face. This revealed to all people that this face is just a natural landform.

In conclusion NASA knows more than just typical average day people. NASA has proved us wrong from thinking it is a face created by aliens. This is just an illusional face as I would say.

Also if this was true, NASA wouldn't hide this because if they were to discover ancient civilization they would earn alot of money.

To start off there are different looking landforms on are planet why can't there be others. In the first set of pictures it shows the landform changed,so a face wasn't there to begin with,it was forming over time. Also sometimes when the human mind is told something it would try to shape together to form what was said, so this could be just a natural landform and your mind is changing it.

Also NASA would not keep this a secret if alien activity was found in this area,if anything NASA would make alot of money off of this discovery if it did have to do with aliens. But if NASA wanted to keep it a secret they wouldnt have took a picture and let the media get ahold of it they would have kept the pictures stashed away. Also the media is known to blow things out of proportion.

In conclusion of my argument,we have tried and tried for many years to find something unatural or indifferent on another planet,eventually we would have stumbled upon something, but its just a landform,no alien activity.

Why is NASA being accused of hiding something from the public if they would benefit from discovering something that has to do with exterterrestial life? The Conspiracuy theories are ridiculous and it is completly idiodic to think that people would hide something if they wold benifit from it.

The MArs Global Surveyor in later years proved that it was just shoadows on a mound with a better camera it showed mor detail that it was just a mound of rock. There are people who still thing it is aleins. Even if there were objects with the camera you could see shack youcould see everything.

What the photo really shows is a bette or mesa landforms its a lava dome that takes the form of aan isolated mesa. these are common in the American West.

The ""faces"" are just showdows on a lava dome. The faces are just shadows on the lava dome. With the high reasolouton camera we proved that.   ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
31CAE911027A,"Over the course of time, NASA has developed the technology that is capable of taking pictures of landforms found on other planets. Recently, NASA unveiled an image of a landform on Mars that looks like a human face. Some people believe that it a real face of an alien and make conspiracy theories about the face and spread it throughout the public. Even though that the ""face on Mars"" is just a rock landform shaped like a human face.

Firstly, humans would not be able to survive on Mars. The gases and lack of oxygen would kill them. The reality is that the picture is an actual human or alien face is just made up by conspiracy theorists . NASA has revealed this to the public so that they could some attention to mars.""The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars (3).They just wanted conspiracy theorist to make people think that there was some sort of ancient civilization on Mars or some kind of aliens. Which was proven not to exist.

After NASA getting all attention on Mars from the ""Face on Mars"" debate, they went back upto space to see if they could capture more photos. NASA was using high-tech cameras to prove their theory of seeing a human face. ""MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when then image first appeared on JPL website, revealing... a natrual landform(7)."" The face is just a landform not an alien monument nor a human face.

Later on, after taking the pictures of the proven landform on Mars, the topic started to quite down. Some conspiracy theorist still spread their theories to the public. This is all how NASA researches foreign landforms on other planets. They take their camera satillites and capture a picture of the landform and continue to study it. NASA uses the knowledge they have about Earth to study the landforms on other planets. ""It reminds me most of the Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, say Garvin. That's a lava dome that takes place from an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars (12)."" The process just starts all over again.

After looking at all the scientific knowlege, you can conclude that the ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform. NASA does this so that they can get public attention about their research, until the theory is proven wrong. It is just like any other buisness that wants publicity. Aliens are currently proven to not exist, so most people like to try to change that theory whenever they find a small peice,of what could be eveidence.

207D7CEADF38,"In May, 1976, Mars became the center for many conspiracy theories and research for alien life. A picture of what seems to be a huge head in a rock formation was unveiled, and immediately started to sway people's minds that there might be alien life on Mars. Some took this belief way too far. However many conspiracy theories are claiming that the martian mesa in Cydonia is a sign of alien life, none of them are correct. In all truth, it is just another naural land formation on the desolate planet.

When a picture of the mesa was first unveiled to the public, it made so many people believe it was a sign of life on Mars. NASA claimed that is was just a normal rock formation, and was confirmed in 2001 when they took another picture with newer technology, revealing a big mesa with a few craters. People still don't believe NASA that it is just a crater. If the mesa was a sign of alien life, NASA would benefit greatly from it. So when people say that it's a sign of life and NASA knows about it, that's so incredibly wrong because if it was, NASA would be there right now with a rover, exploring the strange sign. NASA has done extensive research on this, and have found no life, while people are claiming huge things like this without doing any research, so it is very hard for anyone to believe them.

The next photo, taken in 1998, of the mesa reveals nothing but a natural landform. When the picture was taken, there were some wispy clouds over the top of it, which made some people believe alien markings were hidden by haze. Even though there is a slight haze over the mesa, there is no way a slight haze could hide alien markings the way some people belive. Even with the haze, the picture is still much more clear than the original photo from 1976.

The newest, and most clear picture is from 2001. It was a cloudless day this time when the Mars Global Surveyor passed over the mesa and snapped a picture of it. The picure was taken using the highest resolution in the camera's capability. This type of quality photography allowed for us, back on Earth, to be able to see if there were even smaller objects on the mesa, like airplanes or small shacks The picture revealed, once again, that there is not really a face on the mesa on Mars. The conspiracy theorists are still coming up with ways to try and find a way to make NASA seem like liars. After 25 years, it still didn't work.

After 25 years, and 3 picture all concluding that the mesa has no sings of life, people are still talking about crazy ideas of life outside of Earth. While there is a possibility of life outside of Earth, there is definitely none currently on the mesa that has created so much controversy, for such a long period of time all around the world.

80D6E256AA49,"Landform or alien? The face on Mars looks pretty cool right. This face of Mars made it to hollywood and radio talks and books. People were egar to see this face, once they saw it then there was alien talk. We all know its cool to think there might be life out there, but it's just a natural landform.

Even though this face is so detailed with the mouth and the eyes and nose, it's just a natural landform. NASA even said it for themselves. "" Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform. There was NO alien monument after all."" So, If a professional NASA team says it's a landform, i'm not going to argue on the debate.

However if your still not conviced I have more to prove. I haven't heard any information about aliens being true or alive. So, why would we still believe and hold on to the fact that there may not be life out there. NASA hasn't said anything about aliens but they have said that things happen. Such as the face on mars.

Although there are many, many facts about the face on Mars, I would get if you came up to me and said ""Aliens did this to Mras because its so detail and how could that be if no one has been to Mars, so there are aliens."" Only because we don't actually know if there are aliens ,but in the end its just lava that created this dome like face. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

Aliens are not even real. There are camras om thoes robots so they would know if they seen anything. Have you ever got a warning that an alien invation was about to occur?

I think that some dust and rocks made this shape occur. Scientist have thier studies. My question is how did this alien form this pop up form. If u say it was a alien does it live under the dust. I don't think so,because it adventually is going to die. This is nonsense to belive that aliens walked on Mars and formed a type of shape. It is just a natural form.

Why do you think this is an alien. One reason they would is because of it's shape. Do you have any evidence to prove to that this is an aliens shape. They probably would say no,because I do not see any antenas. That is a big hint to tell if that was an alien or not.

Were's the body all you can see is a face so why assum it's an alien. Perfect good sense would tell you aliens aren't real. It's just a from that was created by natual resources on the planet. Use your research and don't go believing anything crazy. Such,as aliens living on Mars with just a head. I mean use common sense. What do you physically see on an alien. A big head,antena's,body,and wierd looking feet.

This is not an alien people it is just a from that was created by natural resources. So don't go believing nothing foolish that we have aliens roaming different planets.

Even Knowing that nasa wishes there was ancient people living on mars doesnt mean there actually is. They may be very smart people but they have no proof that this was done by a type of living being. They clearly state that everything they get is only facts and off research and strictly that nothing else. These people who are doubting nasa abviously have no idea what there talking about if they think nasa is purposley lying to us. They say that these faces are very normal and common and that this one has very different shadowing to help it look like adifferent face. They have shown many other faces or land forms like this in the past, I would understand if this was the first one and maybe that would give them a litlle reason to doubt them like they did. nasa says they have seen similair things like this on our earth. That should tell you that what is going on now isnt anything different or special to us. I understand why you would think its something crazy special but its really not, nasa them selves got all happy over nothing as well until they got another look at it.

They said they thought it was something they havent seen before but it just ended up being something they really see on a ebery dat bases. Nasa also stated that the types of cameras they used would have easily made it clear to the people that this is normal. These cameras can zoom in so close that they would have been able to see if anything moved they could see it. the only thing that was oving that day was the clouds in the sky which is normal for mars. They said they look for small stacks and things moved and even pyramids but yet nothing was abnormal about this situation. These people make even less since because if it can happen here on our normla land it should be normal for a planet like mars to do it to. Mars is the most similair planet to ours. So if it happen over here why is it so breath taking that it happens over there as well.

The picture from the Viking in 1976 was not clear and had 43 meters per pixal. Now in 2016 43 meters per pixal is like anchent to us. In 1998, NASA's Mars Global surveyor (MGS)

took another photogragh of the Face. The picture was a little more clear but NASA still couldn't tell forsure that the Face was a natural landform. In 2001, NASA's MGS took another photogragh of the Face on Mars. The picture from 2001 as the most clear picture of the Face and the latest image of the Face. Each pixel in the 2001 photogragh spans 1.56 meters. That is much better quality then in 1976 with 43 meters per pixal.

First of all I think this because, there is no evidence. No evidence has been found to suggust that there were aliens who built the face. The only thing you can find on aliens are in newspapers or on tv and they are based on pure opions instead of facts.

Secondly I think this because there are things on earth that may look like a face but isnt one. There are many landforms that may resembel a face but were proven to be naturaly formed.

Lastly, I think this because we have digitaly made the image 3 times bigger and found no objects in the picture. So if there were objects in the picture we would have been able to see them. This supports the idea that ther is no life on Mars to create the face.

In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" people think that the face was created by aliens. In this essay I will tell you if the face was created by aliens or if it was just a natural landform. Why would people think this face was created by aliens? Or was it just a natural landform? What would you think about the face being created by aliens?

Now that we got that out of the way, Why would people think that the face was created by aliens? There was not much evidence that the aliens were the ones that created the face. People can not just go around saying that aliens caused the face to happen, Because there was very little proof that it caused by aliens. Garvin also said, ""It reminds him of Middle Buttle in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" In paragraph 12. And in paragraph 7 it also says that there was no alien momentum after all.

Also, Some people think that the face is just a natural landform. I think that the face was caused why a natural landform because I found more information that the face was caused by a natural landform. Like, in paragraph 7 Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a photo and when the image first appeared on a JPL web site it revealed that it was a natural landform.

I think that if the face was really created by aliens there would have been more evidence or proof saying that aliens had created the face. Because there was more proof saying that the face was created by a natural landform. If there was more proof about the face being created by aliens than it just being a natural landform then I am not sure what I would have done.

Last of all, I found out that there was more proof in the face being created by a natural landform than the face being created by aliens. There was more people talking about how it was not created by aliens and there was also people saying that there was proof saying that the face was created by aliens.

The Face is clearly just a huge rock formation on the surface of this planet. There is no logical reason that aliens would of made this Face. It wouldn't of been useful for a home, a shelter, or even just a explimation of life on the Red Plant. This Face represents a human face, but humans aren't capable of living in such conditions of Mars, so if it were aliens, wouldn't they created a face in the ground of a alien and not a human, have which they never seen.

With the new cameras we have today, if there where by any chance, homes, airplanes, or even pyramids on Mars, the cameras would be able to pick them out and NASA would have seen them. With saying this we can comfirmed that there is no showing of life on Mars, so the Face couldn't of been fromed by aliens.

The Face is clearly just a part of nature that was created and with our eyes we see a face. The rock formation that we see, looks like a face using the shadows from the sun, and the form of the rocky surface. With this face getting so popular, many of the conspiracy theorist are taking advantage in that and using their theroies of alien life and planting it in the minds of others.

I do believe that at first you would probably think that an alien created this but after many scientists researching and exploring the ""face"" they clearly stated ""this face reminds us most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plan of Idaho.""

I tink it is a huge rock formation like said in the story. And I also think they said whatever they could just to have the chance for tax payers. To pay to help build the rocket or rover to get pictures of mars and study the surface. And I think it it was real it would be more detailed by maybe making hair eyebrow's or mustache. And standing up. And it is two miles lonf I dont think something would do that. And there is landfroms in the united states like the snake river of Idaho but we never mad that and it looks like a snake. A lave dome in a mesa is the same hight as the face of marrs also. And I dont think it would have a bunch oh holes on its forehead if it was made because usually things are made good and if they can fly a space ship to mars they have to be pretty smart. Other wise they would not be able to build it. And I alsp thought it was fake cause the other mountain by it.

So I physicaly think it would be inpossible to make soemthing that huge of a human. And I think there would be a giant hole around the face because were they needed the rock or whatever it is on mars to make the face.

So my final opinion on this is that it is fake and noone could make this unless you had thoulsands and thoulsands of people.

Something different happened that made TV, magazines, even Hollywood. Viking 1 captured a picture of a FACE on mars. At the time no one knew what made this but NASA did have plenty enough of ideas to figure it out sooner or later.

An argument would be is are aliens actually real or are they a mythical creature that people say is real. The man NASA is talking to would have to find out himself and so would NASA. NASA has plenty enough cameras in space to know if there are actually aliens up in space. This could have been created by a Martian mesa. The face might of had many weird, or unusual shadows.

The only problem would be is there aliens in different Galaxies, or on different planets like the ones in our Galaxy the Milkyway. The Aliens could have flew over and made a face on Mars, or carved it themselves. The problem with the Martian mesa is the shadow could have been created by the camer or ship that was flying around the planet Mars.

The was to prove them wrong though is, we have been studying and flying cameras out into space for awhile and have been searching for aliens the whole time. NASA's cameras are still in space and they are still searching. The Shadow was to large to be created by the ship or camera that was flying around mars.

In the beginning of the sentence it says that few scientists think that the face was an alien artifact. That might be true but it says that FEW scientists believe the face was alien. Few isn't many.

The text has something else that will amaze some of you, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginal Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers, were waiting when the image first apperared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The text said it all. They have a picture to show that the Face is just a natural landform that this planet has made. And it may just look happen to look like a face.

As you read on in the excerpt it says, ""What the picture actually showws is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West."" The key word is landforms, landforms form all over earth; why not on other planets as well?

Some people may still be conviced that it was an alien artificat that did all this. They may think in their minds that nothing can look that much like a face; some things actually can. Again if you go outside and say you find a rock that is shaped funny, then you pick it up and it looks like a face, unless someone did that on purpose, that was earth's creation.

After reading this article, and writing this, I still am convinced that the Face on Mars is a natural landform. It all makes sense; the pictures, the explantation, the mesa, etc. But again some people may think otherwise that the Face is a alien artifact. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
08B850AB5780,"The Face on Mars is definitely not an alien artifact. It is just a natural landform that was formed on Mars. Don't you think we would have discovered this earlier if it was an alien artifact.

When we first photographed the Face is 1976 we said it looked like a face, but when we released the pictures a few days later the caption noted a ""huge rock formation which resembles a human head formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" This means that other people here at NASA had doubts about it being an actual human head.

When we went to photograph it a second time in 1998 we got a picture that was ten times sharper than the original photos. After waiting for the image to appear on the internet we stated that it was just a natural landform and that there was no alien monument after all.

Then we went back to photograph the Face a third time to prove that it was just a natural landform on April 8, 2001. It was a cloudless summer day which means that the images would be clear. Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's best quality. Jim Garvin later added to the subject of the Face being a natural landform by saying ""It remimds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake Piver Plain in Idaho, that's a lava dome that takes form of an isloated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" This means that Jim Garvin believes that it may just be a lava dome that is on Mars and not a face.

Now some people might say we don't want anybody knowing there is life on Mars. Conspiracy theorists say "" The Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide."" But why would we want to hide life on Mars. It wouldn't hurt our business if anything it would make our business even better so why would we want to keep it a secret if it really was a face.

There is just to much evidence as to why this lanform isn't a face. I'm sure many of people would agree with me on this topic. Maybe one day we will discover life on Mars, but for now it is just a natural landform.                          ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Well one if NASA keeps saying that there is nothing there its just a face then yeah its just a land form shapped like a face. NASA would get a lot of money if they found some life form on a planet so they wouldnt keep it quiet. There are many land forms that look like that. So if the MGS on the planet kept looking it would find more land forms that looked like that. If it was an alien how is it still alive. All living things need water to survive. So wheres the water at? Also the people found beter cameras to use to take the picture. It was much clearer and you could tell it was just a land form. Michael Malin an his team messed up the first time because when they took the picture it was winter and very cloudy on the Red Planet. The camera lense had to look through shallow clouds to see the face. So some people said the alien face was hidden by haze. So Micheal Malin and his team tried again in April 8, 2001 to take another picture. It was perfect because it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. The picture was clear perfect nothing could have told you that, that was an alien face. Some even said it looks like something here on earth. Either a pyramid in Egyptian time or maybe even a mountain. You can make up myths and say that its an alien face, but all the facts say that its just a land form. The land form that looks like a face. It is the ""face"" that helped NASA look closer at there pictures and work on there camera work.

In May 2001, a spacecraft from NASA spotted something on Mars that they thought looked like a face, but it really isn't. I agree it does look relatively like a face, but I am here to tell you the truth about what that face really is.

What the picture actually shows is the martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West. Jim Garvin said ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" If you don't know what that is, its a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.

On April 5, 1998 when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Clydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos.(which were not very clear) Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting for NASA to share the picture. As they posted the picture online, it revealed that it was clearly not a face created by aliens, it was just a landform that looked like a face.

But after NASA showed the whole world that there was no face on Mars, not everyone was satisfied. They even said that the face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude. And that it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on Mars. They also said that since it was such a cloudy time on Mars that the camera made a mistake because it had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Some skeptics even said that perhaps alien markings were hidden by the cloudy haze.

I can assure you that those rumors may seem logical, but they are not real at all.

Our cameras did not make any mistakes and Mars ""face"" is just a landform. If you ever hear from anyone that Mars has a face you can tell them that it isn't real and that there are no such thing as aliens on mars nor will there ever be.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
3FA5AFBA302B,"Have you ever gtten your hopes up for something special, but you secretly knew you wouldn't get what you wanted? That is how some felt once they discovered the ""Face on Mars"" wasn't actually a face. Many convincing facts led NASA's employees to believe this natural landform was actually a human face. However, there just so happened to be a few more facts and pieces of evidence to tell otherwise.

In September of 1997, Cydonia became NASA's number one priority when Mars Global Surveyor arrived to the Red Planet. The article says this was eighteen long years after the Vikings missions ended. Jim Garvin explaines how they felt this landform was important to taxpayers and they photographed the Face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. Beacause this mysterious form exsited and NASA payed so much attention to it, it shows that they only used solid facts to explain how this landform was created naturally and not by aliens.

It was not until Apri 5, 1998, a year after Cydonia became their priority, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, as stated in the article. It also says Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture which was ten time sharper than the original Viking photos. This comes to show that NASA did not just go off one photo taken eighteen years before hand. Eager web surfers were anxious to find out something juicy, such as alien life form on Mars, but to their surprise the Face had occured naturally.

The web surfers and many other people were not satisfied with the outcome and were not going to give up on their hopes, but neither was NASA. The critics said how the ""Face on Mars"" is located 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was cloudy on Mars when the photo was taken. NASA then prepared to look again. Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 Mars Global Surveyor drew in closer for a second time. Garvin stated, ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of veiw."" The pixels in the most recent pictures taken spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixels in the best 1976 Viking photo. Garvin also adds how you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. This means that it is the clearest image you could take and if there just so happened to be things such as airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks the picture could have clearly captured them.

Although many wanted to believe the Face was anything but a natural landform, NASA used strong facts and evidence to fight the arguement and convince people otherwise. I strongly believe The Face on Mars is natural and was not created otherwise because they used all facts and has three different pictures one of which could have spotted things other than the landform, but did not. Nothing but the truth was caught on camera and that is that the ""Face on Mars"" is nothing but a natural landform, and nothing more.               ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
3D04759D458C,"Many people may argue that the landscape in the picture taken in 1976 was a landscape made by aliens. These people think the landscape was created by an alien because the picture resembled a human head with eyes, nose, and a mouth. In fact, this image became so popular in the next 25 years, that it started to show on books and magazines. Some people still think that the landscape was created by aliens. However, the Face was created by aliens has been proven false because the of the new data and research over the next 30 years showed that it was just a mesa.

Scientists examined this photo to actually prove if the landscape was actually made by aliens or not. After research, our NASA scientists and I proved that it was just a mesa which are common around Cydonia. To become more factual about this, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and took more pictures of the Face. This occured in 1998 with better cameras than the first ones taken in 1976. The picture became 10 times clearer than the first picture taken which led to our conclusion that it was indeed just a mesa.

In response to those who still believe that the Face was created by aliens, our data has shown that is not. We even took more photos in 2001 showing clearly that the Face is just a normal mesa. There were no human features in the pictures that were taken in 2001 unlike the ones from 1976. Our scientists and I ensure you that this is just a regular mesa which are common to find.

In 1998 NASA captured a pictue of the face as soon as they could get a good shot at it. The picture revealed that it was just a natural landform, just like NASA had said in 1976. Also, when the original picture was taken in 1976 it was revealed to be an illusion of a face by NASA. If NASA chose to call the landform work done by aliens, they would recieve more funding. However, NASA was very truthful in there fundings and they didn't have any reason besides the truth to say it was a natural landform. Finally, the clearest pictue of it taken in 2001 clearly shows a natural landform that couldn't be mistaken for anything else.

This quote proves that the best picture ever taken so far of the Face clearly shows that it is a natural thing. The natural landform could not be mistaken as anything else in the pictures we have.

It is clear that the Face is a natural landform because the picture in 1998 revealed it, NASA comfired it was a natural thing which caused them to not get extra funding, and the picture taken in 2001 is the clearest one we have and it is very obvious that it is a natural landform.

EE67DDC301F2,"The ""face on Mars"" isnt even a real face, it's an illution. I know that because of thhe article. The article has some interesting things to say. Including that it's not a real human or any of that nonsense. I know that for a fact and here are some reasons that it's not a face.

First, over the years the face hasn't stayed looking the same and you can see that by looking at the pictures in the article. Mars isn't still it has winds and winter and summer. As said in paragraph ten, ""a cloudless summer day in Cydonia."" So, Mars is going to have land differences. Just like we have tectonic plates moving, winds, earthquakes, etc. That changes the surface of the land. So, Mars has the same.

Just like Earth's surface is changing everyday so is Mars.

Then, you can't just look at Mars and see the face immediatly. You have to be standing at the perfect angle. It says in paragraph 7, ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" Not only did the camera take a better featured picure but they also had to be at a specific angel. As said in paragraph 10, ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view."" You have to be in a specific angle to see the ""face."" Just like when things look funny in a specific angle. Like how Italy looks like a boot to some people. So, it wasnt alien made it just has to do with the land moving or wind moving the dust into making it look like a face.

Finally, this has nothing to do with aliens or an ancient civilization doing it. It's just natural landform. Wind probably made this or the change in land but no ancient civilization. NASA only wanted Mars to get a little attention and to show people the wanders of the plant.    ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
E358694E1984,"I believe that the so called face is just a natural landform. It is just a mountain with shadows that create an illusion of a face. In the very first picture of this landform it was very blurry, now cameras has evolved so now it is clear.

NASA wanted to figure out if this was a ancient face or an regular landform. So , 22 years later NASA went back to Mars to figure out what this landform is. With the technology NASA have they took pictures of the landform and they found out it was just a regular landform.

NASA wanted to do a double-check so in 2001 they took some more pictures. Now the pictures came out more clear than the last picture in 1998. Then NASA proved once again that it was just a natural landform.

Those are the reasons why that it is a natural landform. It was proved twice and the pictures were accurate, 3 times better the vision the last time they took a photo.

That shows that NASA doesn't want to say to anybody that is assuming that this is created by aliens because they really want this to be confidential.

In reality they don't know what they are saying so they are assuming that this was created by aliens just to start talk and give people something to talk about.

If NASA won't leak anything then everyone is just assumimg.

The Face, a well known landmark on the planet of Mars, is a landmark that has caused NASA a lot of debate. The debate is ""Was The Face created by aliens, or was it created by natural landform?"". This has caused NASA and many scientists to have problems, because there are a few scientists that believe that The Face was created by aliens.

The Face was originally discover in 1976, by the photographers aboard NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft. In the picture taken in 1976, you can clearly see a face in the landform. But in the picture taken in 1998, the atmosphere was extremely cloudy, so if there was any indention in Mars's base, you couldn't see it because of the clouds. Because of this, scientists went out on another attempt to capture a good image of The Fcae on Mars, and they succeeded.

The picture that was taken in 2001 clearly showed that The Face was no longer there, which lead scientists to believe that it was a combination of natural landform and the shadows casted from the sun's rays that made that particular spot look like           ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The author states ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa- landforms common around the American West.""

0EDCA766F250,"The Face of Mars. What a discovery! This geological wonder on Mars has been very famous since its discovery in 1976. Its been seen in films, magazines, books, even at grocery stores. It's so popular that some people wonder how it came to be. One popular theory is that the Face was made by aliens, or martians if you will. I believe that theory is absurd. There are so many reasons to show that this was not made by some form of a living being.

First off, if this was made by an organism, then where r they? Why did they leave? What was their reason for making this face? Why isn't it more detailed if the beings that made this were intentionally making a face? It just doesn't add up. Besides, even if it was made by someone, wouldn't we have found some residue of civilization? When ever someone, or something, leaves a place there is always a geological hint that they were there.

That's why I believe that it was naturally made. It's not that hard to believe, actually. There are some of those naturally made landmarks here on Earth as well. For example, there was a winter in Colorado where a mountain had snow on it's side in the form of a ""Y"". There is also Eagle Lake in Michigan. Why is it called Eagle Lake? Because it looks like an eagle from above. So I have no doubt that this ""Face on Mars"" is naturually made. It was not made some alien civilization.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

In an article I read is said that the scientist believe and then it said that the theorist believe, so my question is, are you going to believe a theorist someone who probably hasn't even seen it in person over someone who has probably examined the face over a thousand times trying to come up with something reasonable and real evidence to give the people. A scientist said that he believed that is was a mesa or a butte. Yes, it is true that the government could be hiding aliens and their having the scientist just say that for there sack, but is it likely, no. The scientist have said that they think they've actually seen it somewhere. So maybe there not lieing and it seriously is just a mesa or a butte.

Garvin, a man who went to go see the face has said ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" and has also said ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same hight as the Face on Mars.""

In the text someone sates,""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin. Second of all, the Face is more simialr to a butte is becasue people could identify that they have seen something simialr to the Face.

For example, in the text they explain that it was hard to take a picture because of cloud coverage. Just becasue the clouds coverd it doesn't mean that the clouds will clear, and i'm sure you could have seen it just not all of it. Lastly, When the picture was taken they said that each pixel was 1.56 meters instead of the 43 meters per pixel in the picture taken in 1976.

""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butted or mesa- landforms common around the American West"" is a claim made by Garvin who believes its just a natural landform."" New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry form NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A mesa,"" explains that technology has proven it is actually a natural landform by the improvement of technology. Evidence made by Malin's team ""captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution,"" supports the idea that technology has improved throughout the years.

Research had been made to prove that the Face is just a natural landform. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh,"" is evidence that the Face made on Mars wasn't made by aliens.

The Face on Mars is a natural landform. Research had been made and had been proven. Aliens didn't possibly create this landform on Mars. The Face is officially confirmed by research from NASA that it is a natural landform.              ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
F111E3D5E713,"Lots of people think the face on Mars is an alien or something else,its really not. The face on Mars is not an alien because there is no proof of it being an alien. Only few people have said it looked like an alien,but they have no proof of that being true. Lots of scientist and NASA have proof that its not an alien and that it is something else thats there. People who think that the face is an alien, they are wrong.

The face on Mars is not an alien because NASA said it was a sort of rock formation. Also that it looked like a human head. NASA never said it looked like an alien or that they had proof of it being an alien. NASA said ""NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose,and mouth"". NASA also gave proof that the shadows gave an illusion of the rock formation that it looked like a face.

Another way that it did not look like a face is that MOC said it was just a landform on Mars. MOC also said that the face was not and alien and revealed what it actually was. MOC said "" MOC team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos...anxious web sufers were wating when the image first appeared on a JPL web site,revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all"". MOC had proof and a picture that the face was not an alien and that it was something diffrent.

Finally, you can see that most of the scientist said it was a type of landform or something else. They never said that is was an alien. They all had proof and a picture to tell us that it was a natrual landform. The face is actually a Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa which is a type of landform.

220BA359391B,"There are many things that people think the Face on mars is. You however, think that the face was created by aliens. We have gathered a lot of evidence on this and here is why you are wrong.

In paragraph 12 it says, ""What the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West."" So if it really was an ancient alien artifact then that mean that aliens have been here as well. Along with all of the pictures we have aquired if there was a civilization we would have been able to see at least some of the remains in the pictures. But we have not.

Paragraph eight however, says, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Though this could be true, we have better quality pictures now than we did then and there are no alien markings shown. With the quality of the pictures we have now we can zoom in and it still looks fairly close to how it looks at normal size, and there are no markings.

In paragraph seven it tells us once more that, yet again, it is a natural landform. But people are not satisfied with that answer. In paragraph five conspiracy theorists say that it's bona fide, or evidence of life on Mars. They say that NASA would rather hide this information but people who work for NASA wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. Would they seriously hide this kind of information from the public? No, because it would get them money and this would possibly be a world changing discovery.

59F4AC1C5604,"Why do I think that the Face on Mars was not created by aliens? I think that ,because on April 5, 1998 Mars Orbiter Camera team took a picture of the Face on Mars ten times sharper than the orginal picture in 1976 by the Viking. My second reason why I don't believe that aliens created the Face on Mars, is becase on April 8, 2001 Malin's team took a picture of the Face on Mars. Not only is believing that the Face on Mars was created by aliens is illogical, but many pictures have been taken, there is still not a single sign of aliens.

My first reason why I don't think the aliens created the Face on Mars is because the MOC team snapped a photo of the Face on Mars ten times sharper, so you could see more clearly. You could see clearer than the orginal Viking photos. When the web surfers saw the picture, all they could see was a natural landform. Not any sign of aliens. My piont is that the clearer the pictue gets, the less it reveals that aliens created the Face on Mars.

According to the article ''Unmasking the Face on Mars'', ""Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution.'' Garvin told them. Compared to the 1976 photo taken by the Viking, the newer camera spans 1.56 meters for each pixel. This camera allows you to discern objects in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. Garvin told the author of ''Unmasking the Face on Mars.'' People who believe that aliens created the Face on Mars can not argue that it was cloudy in that picture for it was taken in the summer, unlike the previous picture. The picture that Malin's team took had no signs of aliens.

My last reason as why not aliens did not create the Face on Mars is because it's illogical. Using common sense you should be abe to see in all of these pictures that there is no sign of aliens. Photo after Phote prove that aliens did not create the Face on Mars.

All three of these reasons are why I don't think aliens created the Face on Mars. I believe that it's just natural landform.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
D2C660F78A38,"The face that you see on mars was not something created by aliens. Although it may look like a face its not. What you see in this picture is a butte or a mesa. In the following paragraphs I will state reasons helping you undertstand that the pictures effect everything and that it wasnt created by aliens.

The pictures that you have seen are very old. Most of the pictures you have seen where taken from 1976-2001. These pictures have really bad graphics. Things that are old are usaually harder to understand and comperhend. Its hard to see old things clear. Advances in technology have helped us see older things a lot more clear. We can fully understand things from the past now.

The cameras we use today have a lot better grapics. Back then their images could only span 43 meters per pixel. Today our cameras can span 1.56 meters per pixel which is a lot better. This helps us see pictures a lot more clear. We took pictures of the of the face and could see certain things the older cameras couldn't see.

In the new pictures if there were objects in this picture like airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids we would easily see them. There wasn't any of these things. What the picture of the face showed was equivalent to a butte or mesa. It looked like landforms found in the American West. It reminds people of the

Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

All the new pictures we have help us undertstand and see things more clear. We now know that it wasn't created by aliens. Its just a simple butte or mesa thats no very special besides the fact that it kind of looks like a face. It reminds people of a Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. This face has nothing to do with aliens.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
838005D1D7DC,"The Face on Mars is just a natural landform. Many people think that the Face was created by aliens, but this is not correct. There is no proof that shows that the face was created by aliens, but there is much information to back up the fact that the Face is just a natural landform.

In the passage, Garvin says, ""'As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,' he added. 'So, if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the gorund or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'"" This shows that even when people from NASA zoomed in on the face to get a better look at it, they couldn't find any sign of alien life which means that there is a very low possibility that there are aliens that could've done this.

Another reason that shows that aliens couldn't have done this is when the passage says, ""Thousands of anxious web surfurs were waiting when the image first apperared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" If scientists at NASA have studied this face and taken many pictures but still can't find any type of alien life, then there isn't any.

The last piece of evidence that shows that aliens didn't make the Face is when the text says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.

EC6EFB83A674,"Mars is the fourth planet from the sun and since it is now 2016 it was about 40 years ago that a face was found on the planet. Some people think it was made by aliens and other people are logical and say it is a natral land form. I think it is just a land form because you can duscern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, we havent found anything else, and it look like some of the landforms here on earth.

First of all, in paragraph 11 it says that as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image up to 3 times its size. This helps prove it wasnt made by aliens because they cal close in on the picture and they didnt find anything else around it like other sculptures or houses or anything. therefore, it was either really old or just a land form.

Also, we haven't found anything else on the planet. If aliens made that dont you think they would have made other things and if they did wouldnt they also be there. It is not likely the face is an artifact because there should be more and if it was made by aliens and they had more it is unlikely that they made them and only that one is still there.

It does look a lot like what the agyptians made so if there were aliens they would probably be capable of doing that but it also looks like some of the landforms we have here on earth. Garvin even says in paragraph 12 ""It reminds me most of middle butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. hat's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated masa about the same height as the face on mars.""

In conclution, It is just a natural landform that happens to look like a face. We havent found anything else on the planet and the ppicture doesnt have anything in it like a home.

The proof is that a little while later after the face in Mars was found scientists figured it was only a Martian mesa, something that was common around Cydonia. The only reason why it looks like a face is because it had unusual shadows on it.

The other reason why I beleive aliens didn't casue the face was because the authors of magazines and other articles thought it would be a good way to enguage the public and attract attention to mars and it worked. Plus when Mars Global Surveyer flew over the area one more time to get a better shot at the face it reavealed that it was just another normal landform and not an alien monument.

77FEBBF29575,"Twenty Five years ago, something oddly strange happend on Mars. The NASA spacecraft, Viking 1 had caught a photo on the red planet that had a very strong identical look to a human face. Many scientist thought it was the work of aliens but here are some facts to prove that this theory is incorrect. Through the process of movie films, books and other things people used to explain this phenonmean, and through scientifical evidence.

When the news spread about the strange human face on Mars, many people became interested in the fact that aliens could have been responsibel for this event. To surpise the face on Mars has become a popular icon, with many Hollywoodfilms, books, magazines, and even talk shows. This greatly increased the number people going with the idea that aliens could be the cause of this but this idea is false. In the atricle ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", it talks about on April 5,1998 that the Mars Global Surveyor was launched over Mars to check the so called alien monument. While using the Mars Orbiter Camera, Micheal Malin and his crew used his ten time sharp vision to scan the ""alien monument"" and found out it was just a natural lanform.

Even though the scince had proved that the strange face on Mars was just a landform, not alot of people were convinced. However, Science once agian came out to prove once and for all that it was indeed a landform. Using the camera again, Michael Malin and his crew caluclated the picture of the landform while using maximum resoltion and their result was amazing. The photo on Mars and a photo on earth had proved that the Mars face was just a butte or mesa landform. Infact, these are common in the American West!

There will always be arugements around the world, but these facts prove that the Mars Face is just a landform. All the movies, books, and magizines can be be true and interesting to belive, but the science in it all proves that this whole ""alien monument"" and that Mars has a face, is all far-fetched.

This picutre was take by NASA's Viking one spaceship. It happened to be taking these photos to find places for the Viking two spacecraft to safely land. When it came arcross this uncommon sight it snapped a picture.

When the image appeared on the monitor most of NASA were surprised at the image that lied before them. Scientist soon figured out that it was just a Matian mesa. Which happened to be very common around Cydonia. Most people argue saying that this could be a sign that there use to be life on Mars.

When NASA revealed the image for everyone to see, people started to think it wasn't just another rock or land marking. People saw the face and thought aliens were found on Mars. Although, that wasn't the case. Only a few scientist thought the Face was an alien artifact. The other scientist thought it was just something like a rock that happened to look like a face, because of the shadows.

After a lot of research another spacecraft was sent to Mars on September ninteen ninty-seven. Eighteen years after the photo of the Face was taken by the Viking one. The Face was then photograph again, so that it could be examined more closely. ""On April 5,1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time,Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture tentimes sharper that the original Viking photos.""

Thousands of excited people were waiting for the image. ""It first appeared on the JPL wedsite,revealing... a natural landform."" There was no sign of anything Alien about the photo. Therefore, it was not an alien aftifact after all.

Many people were unsatisfied. They claimed that since the picture of the Face was taken in a cloudy area it might explain why no one saw life in the first place. Scientist took this theory into thought. Mission controllers stated another spacecraft to send again.

This face has shodows and yes it does make it look like it has eyes, nose, and mouth, but that just really what we want to see if you were told it was a face you would've beleived it.

The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" has a lot of suspense and it does indeed pull the reader in, and towards the end they break down the scientific facts. They use examples of here on earth and they talk about the showdows. They even talk about how the resolution of photos could change the perspective of those photos.

This face shaped mound on mars has just thrown all the theories out and has caused a big worry in the world. Personally I did not see the face until i had read through the article pretty much pin-pointing all of the features, so i went back to the picture of the face and that when i did see it. One persons theory has caused problems for everything from t. v. to conversations.

The fact of the matter is that when you look at this mound and you are told its a face you are most likely gonna beleive that concept until you get the scientific facts and you read them and you probably still wont beleive it, because as humans there has always got to be something that drives you to be excited. Its in our genetics and our concept is just going to be stuck with until there is an actual reasoning that can be proven.

The photo was taken with a resolution with 43 meters per pixel leaving out many details that could not be captured, therefore making the landform appear as if it were a face. When NASA took a seccond photo with a camera that had a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel in the exact same location as the first photo was taken the image looked nothing like a face because it captured many more details than the first this show the distortion of the first caused it to look like a face. Also when the seccond photo was taken it was a clear day and there was not any clouds unlike the first photo which means it could not have been affected at all. Unlike the seccond image the first had clouds which could draken or lighten the image in certain places to give details that make it look like a face are not actually there on the landform.

CD5876BAE9C1,"There are three key reasons that NASA would not want to hidde the evidence or wouldn't want a ancient civilzation. One reason is that having a ancient civilzation would be a key thing to research. Another one is it would make the popularity and profits go up for NASA. The Third reason is that the face is two miles wide, and resembles a butte, from the camera's quality.

They wouldn't want to hide this civilzation, because they would have reasearch and more popularity. NASA's defenders say they wish there was a civilzation. The article stated this about the Nasa budget: ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an Ancient civilzation on Mars."" They want there to be one but that isn't what it is.

NASA would get more donations and profit if this was true. This means NASA wouldn't want to deny it if it even was true. The reasoning of the conspiracy theorists are wrong saying that they want to hide this evidence, because they don't. This would enable them to accomplish farther space study and more information about an extra terristral civilzation.

The camera they used in 2001 compared to 1977 had a way better camera. Also they stated in the article ""...on April 8, 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia--Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look"". This takes out the reasoning of the conspiracy theorists that their were clouds and shadows blocking the camera that made it appear as a butte in 2001 compared to when it looked like a face in 1977.

NASA has done extensive research on this topic and wished it was true. The facts prove it is not real, and how it would help NASA if it was. As the cameras have gotten better and people have resoned better it proves the Mars face was a natural mishap from shadows of the two mile wide butte. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
D8B78C81AF21,"Do you believe that NASA is with holding information about an alien species? Many people in fact do. However, their arguments are severely flawed. There are thousands and thousands of naturally made landforms on planet Earth, and we can only logically assume there are even more naturally made landforms in space. The landform that is debatebly the most 'likely to be made by aliens' is the Face from Mars. Contrary to what the alien theorists may say, the Face is only another naturally made landform since in high quality pictures it appears quite normal, there are no strange markings or anything around it, and its appearance is only an illusion.

NASA and its team has tried many and many times to get clear pictures of the Face. Nowadays, its getting some of the best pictures that's ever been taken. Jim Garven quotes, We photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it. ""..on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos,"" furthermore says the article. The pictures showcase the Face as normal and just like any other naturally made landform.

Another thing about the Face that will throw off any conspiracy theorist's opinions is that there are no 'alien monuments' or 'carvings' or 'writings' or anything else around the landform. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all,"" quotes the article. That wouldn't satisfy the theorists so they thought of something else. Which is, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" Try as NASA might, they didn't find anything that could possibly be apart of anything alien. They took more pictures of the Face, especially on days where it would be clear, yet they found nothing of the sort.

Now, one of the biggest things about the Face is that its own 'face' is an illusion constructed by shadows. NASA even described it as so. When they released one of their first pictures of the landform, ""The caption noted a 'huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.'"" Illusions are everywhere, and this particular illusion of a face happens to be quite popular. Their picture of the Face attracted much attention from the public because of the allure of a face on Mars. As their pictures became more high quality, it became clear how the formation looked and how those shadows made it look the way it did.

Others may still say now, that the pictures that NASA takes might very well be positioned badly or incorrectly in a way that does not reveal anything crucial to alien life. NASA listened to them though, ""few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact."" Mission controllers made their way to look at the landform once again. A direct quote from Garvin about the situation is, ""Its not easy to target Cydonia. In fact, it's hard work."" He and everyone else went out of their way to take the perfect picture on a ""cloudless summer day"". We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Malins team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution,"" says Garvin once again. As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were! NASA did their best and better at looking at and around the Face in order to see if they missed anything as important as signs of alien life. They returned with no proof of anything at all as the theorist's would've liked.

To summarize, the Face is a naturally made landform ontop of planet Mars. First of all, in high definition and quality photographs the landform looks normal and not that strange. Secondly, contrary to what alien believers and theorists may have liked to believe there are no 'markings' or etc. around it whatsoever. Lastly, the eyes and nose and mouth that happen to 'appear' on the landform are only an illusion made by shadows, as stated by NASA itself. Earth has just as many natural landforms and even more possibly than Mars. With a trick of the light or seeing it as a particular angle, we could even interpret our own landforms as something that was made by our own hands even if it clearly wasn't. The Face is a clear example of overthinking and reaching for an answer that was already there, it is a naturally made landform. ",6,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
32834C842C36,"Do you honestly think that from reading the article "" Unmasking the Face on Mars"" and from reading theories and looking at pictures of the face that it is a real face? Honestly people it is a natural landfrom. If you look at the three pictures taken in the years 1976,1998, and 2001 you see that it is very blurry at first, but then throughout the years you get a better look at it. As the years go on the ""face"" loses its shape and doesn't look much like a face anymore. The landform is cracking and it looks from the sky like a mound.

My first reason I think that the face is just a landform is that the way it is indented, it could be a mountain or a tall hill. If so, then you could see how between the years 1998 and 2001 the face could have had an avalanch or a simailiar situation happen to it. Cracks form and it looks like by 2001 the left side of the face has a huge indentation in it. If you look closely in the 2001 image taken from the spaceship ""Viking 1""

if you look at the outline of the face's shape, you will see how it kind of slants up like a slide. That is reason to beleive that the Face could be a hill, or a mountain or even a small or large mound.

Okay so econdly, do you believe in god? If you do then did you ever think that since god created everything, that he might have created this so we could study off of it and learn scientific facts. He could have put it there so we can study it and learn and eduacationally grow smarter with this. Another scenario is he put it there so people who want to be scientists or astronauts, that they could see this out in space and have a deeper curiosity for the thin they love and are interested in, whether that is space, or landforms or astrophysics. You never know it could happen.

I can see how you might think that this face structure is not a natural landform. You never know it could be a mound put there covering dead bodies. I know it sounds gross, but think if there is or was another species out there living on mars. Aliens or extra terrestrial creatures could have buried important objects or heirlooms to them there or have buried family or other creatures who have passed on there. You never know, but I can see why you might think that the face is not a natural landform. If I think about it too much my curiosity is kind of wanting to believe all of the unknown stuff such as history or mysteries unknown and veiled by this ""face"" object.

It could be a landform of mysterious identity. It could be a mound of buried treasure or bodies. We may never know. As it says in the passage,"" An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called Cydonia"" [1] This face object may just be there to arise our curiosity. But one thing is for sure. This face in the region of Cydonia on the red planet of Mars is a mystery for sure.

39FB5E10A49D,"In 1976, the Viking 1 took a photo of what was thought to be a 'face' on Mars. The 'face' had a shadow that loomed over the formation; the shadow making it appear as a human face. NASA was thrilled when the Viking 1 captured the picture. A few days after the team found it, NASA reveiled the picture to the public.

Ever since the photo was published, theorists have speculated over what the formation actually was. Many were to believe that it was an alien structure. In fact, it actually is not. The 'alien artifact' is actually a mesa. Mesas are commonly found on planets such as Earth. There would be no possible way that the mesa would be an alien structure.

In the passage, NASA has been taking pictures of it from 1976, 1998, and 2001. Since then, the images have been sharper. In 2001, the picture clearly shows a mesa, not a face. When the latest photo was taken, Malin's team had made the digital picture three times sharper than the rest of the photos. He states that if you were to take a picture of pyramids or other formations, you would be able to clearly see what they were.

The 'Face on Mars' is just a conspiracy theory. No one can actually confirm that there is such thing to exist. If there was such thing on Mars, NASA would probably examine it a bit closer and may reveal to the public about it, but for now, we can only wonder if there really is a face on Mars.

NASA believes it was an alien artifact, but it really is just a natural landform. Mars' ""face"" is a natural landform, not an alien artifact.

Thoughout the years that the ""face"" of Mars was known, there is a change of the landform. Looking at the pictures of 1976, 1998, and 2001 the landform changes. By the time of 1998 the landform has more cracks in it. On April 5, 1998 thousands of people on the web were waiting to see another picture of the land on Mars. The people were not satisfied and said it was not fair. They complained and said it was the cloudiest time of the year for the Red Planet. Yes, they realized that Mars also has wheather. The most common is the sand storms it has. The wind and sand that moves around will change that landform of the surface. The land of Mars will breakdown into even more sand. Like most planets, the land will change by its wheather. The land is caused by natural causes of wheather, not by aliens.

In paragraph seven, it is stated that with higher quality the picture revealed the natural landform. Critics assume the landform is alien made due to the pictures taken in 1976. However, as technology evolved over the span of twenty five years, the landmark was found once again and revealed the Face. ''As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!'' said Jim Gavin. Gavin then compared the landform on Mars to other landforms such as the butte or mesa around the American West. Gavin also stated that a landform similar to the one on Mars was in Idaho, called the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. It is a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. Scientists also ruled out the possibility of an extrasteral force creating the landform. The Face was first thought to be another Martian mesa. A Martian mesa is common around the area of Cydonia. With taking these factors into consideration, the landform was simply created by natural causes over the millions of years. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

NASA wouldn't have sent it out if they really thought is was alien. Some people think that the face is a bona fide for evidence that there is life on mars, but NASA would hide that information. they only sent the image out to get more peoples attention towards mars.

In 1976 you can sort of tell that there is a face on the rock formation. In 1998 you can really tell that there is a face there, but you can also see a change in lighting which because of that you can see the face more.

230641A3AAC1,"""The Face"" on Mars has brought up alot of attention. People are debating whether or not it is real or fake. There are two sides to the argument. Is it a sign of aliens or civilization, or is it just a natural landform on Mars? Some people even say is it even a face at all. Let's find out what it really is.

The face can be argued as a landform or something that an ancient civilation made. We as a whole, NASA, have confirmed it is a natural landform found on Mars, a mesa. Mesas are actually quite common in the American West according to the article. There has been no signs that an ancient civilization has lived on Mars, so it is highly unlikely that the face could've been built by aliens. Although it is possible, it is highly unlikely.

If there was alien life on Mars, we (NASA) wouldn't deny it, because all it would do is bring us more money and more exploration to do. If there would be one sign of ancient civilization on Mars, then that might just mean that it could or once did support life. We have checked to make sure that there is signs of life on and near the face by taking multiple pictures like the pictures in 1976, 1998, and in 2001. Some said that alien markings were hidden by haze but we have proven them wrong as seen from the pictures.

In conclusion, ""The Face"" that has been argued about is just a natural landform called a mesa. It is not alien made, it is natural. Although it is possible for aliens to have created something on Mars, we have not found any signs of alien life capable of making such things. So for now, there is no signs of aliens that we know of yet. But once we do find a sign, you better bet that we, NASA, will tell as soon as possible.        ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
FC0C60D3B9B1,"The face on Mars is nothing but a Martian equivalent of a butte or a mesa. Martian mesas are common enough around Cydonia. So it wouldnt have been surprising if it was just an ordinary mesa. In1976, Viking 1 saw the mesa and thought it looked like a face. But scientists found out that it was just a martian mesa.

On April 5, 1998 a Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera took a picture of the Mesa that looked like face. The picture was ten times better than the picture that the Viking 1 took. They found out that it was just a natural landform and that it wasnt an alien monument at all. Yet with all the proof some people did not believe that it wasnt just a regular Mars mesa due to that it was a cloudy year on Mars. So on April 8, 2001 it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia and the Global Mars Surveyor got a second chance to look at the butte. The surveyor took a photo using its cameras absolute maximum resolution. The picture showed that it was just a Martian equivalent of a butte or a messa.

ABF0CD33A11E,"The Face, an interesting topic to many people. Although some people question its formity. Is it a natural landform? Or was it created by Aliens? People have their opinions on what it is but after doing more research from NASA, this article explains what the Face really is. It gives you background information to help understand what the Face is, a natural landform.

""The Face has been seen by multiple NASA scientists. Many argue that it was created by Aliens while others argue the Face is just a natural landform. In paragraph three of the article it states ""The caption noted a 'huge rock formation... which resembles as a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" The paragraph said it was a rock formation, which is part of natural landform. The Face was just a rock forned like a human head and that only the shadows are giving out an illusion of a human face. After a few years scientists went back to Cydonia to explore more about this odd structure. On April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiters camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the orginial Viking's photos.

676DC820EDFD,"Alien Life! A very controversial topic, some might say, especially at this point in time.

Some people believe that the face that has been photographed on Mars is evidence of alien life; however, it is just a landform because if NASA wanted to hide the existence of aliens they wouldn't have released this image in the first place, there were no other ""alien artifacts"" near the face in any of the images, and if the face was in fact an alien artifact, NASA would use this to its advantage because they would receive more funding to find alien life since there would be proof that alien life actually exists. Obviously, the face on Mars is not an alien artifact but only a natural landform made on the surface of the Red Planet.

One of the most blatantly obvious reasons why this face could not be made by aliens is because NASA does not believe that it is. Now, every one is entitled to their own opinions, but because NASA is saying that this face is not an alien artifact you should think that same thing. There would be no reason for NASA to want to release an image that possibly supports that there could be alien life on Mars and then just say that it provides no evidence for life on Mars, if NASA actually believed there really was life on the Red Planet. Either, NASA would have not released the image at all in an effort to prevent people from thinking that aliens could be living on Mars, or they would release their image and say the truth. In this case NASA released the image and then said that it does not support alien life on Mars, so it is very clear that the landform is just a landform and not an alien artifact.

Also, there were no other ""alien artifacts"" near the face. If this really was an alien artifact, there would be evidence left behind of the people that built this face, but there was not. And, the more recent pictures of the face were very high resolution, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters."" That may seem like a very large area for one pixel, but unless these aliens that live on Mars all live in one home that is less than twenty-five square meters, there is no one near this face that could've built it. Clearly, this landform could not have been made by anyone living on Mars because there simply is no one that is living close enough to this face to build it.

And last but not least, if this face on Mars was indeed an alien artifact, NASA would use this scenario to its advantage by blowing up the media with news of alien life in an attempt to gain more funding for the space program. There is absolutely no reason for NASA to try to keep the discovery of alien life a secret because, if anything, NASA would gain substantially from a discovery on that scale, so if the scientists at NASA think that this face is just a landform made on the surface of Mars, there is very little reason for someone to doubt them on this.

Now, some people may say, ""But wait! That face is clear evidence of alien life, and there is no way that a face like that could have naturally formed on Mars!"" If anyone is thinking that same thing, I can see why you may think that, but there is simply no scientific evidence to support your opinion. Yes, it is unlikely for a rock to form in the exact way to make it look like a human, but no, it is not impossible. Additionally, if that face was in fact a natural formation then there is no more evidence for it to support alien life than any other rock on Mars. Obviously, this landform was not made by aliens.

As anyone can see, the face on Mars is just a natural landform because NASA wouldn't release images propagating alien life if they didn't want to say that alien life has been discovered, there is no other evidence supporting aliens on Mars other than the face, and there would be no reason for NASA to try to cover this up because NASA would end up gaining in a situation where alien life was discovered.

Obviously this face is not an alien artifact; however, I believe that alien life does, in fact, exist, and that we may find it in the very near future, so look forward to what may come next.",6,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
F93D65A9D633,"Have you every heard of the ""Face on Mars?"" Some people even think that the face was an alien. NASA (the people who found the ""face"" on Mars) could say otherwise. NASA has many diffrent ways that this is not an alien. The three are that no alien monuments anywhere, that NASA spent countless time trying to make sure that they were wrong, and that the shadows and the lighting make it look like a face.

The first reason why it is not an alien is because they looked for an alien monument and didn't find one. This either means that NASA took all that time and did not find one, or there is not alien monument which means that this being an alien is slim. Not having a monument means that the ""aliens"" didn't have a home or a place to worship. NASA even had a camera ten times sharper than what they found the face with,""MIchael Malin and his MArs Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper that the original Viking photos""(7). This goes to show that the monument and the aliens do not exist.

The second reason is that they tried countless times trying to find more. They spent many years trying to find answers but they never found them. The only answer they got was that the alien they were hopping for wasn't present or was present. On April 8, 2001, that was thier last try. They had amazing pizels but still got nothing, ""Marlin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution"" (10.)

Finally, the shadows made it look like it was a face. Even though it looked like a face, we never know if a shadow hit it good enough that it made it look like that. NASA states that ""only this one had unusual shadows to make it look like an egyptian Pharaoh,"" (2.) This states that unusual shadowing made the mesa look unusual. The later years, the mesa looks less and less like a face.

This shows that the ""Face on Mars"" looks more and more like a shadow. Many years have been put into this ""Face on Mars."" Yet there is not that much they found. NASA would have got a lot of money if they found it. Yet they turned it down because they knew that it was not an alien like they would have hopped.               ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
37AAC5427FBC,"There are many reasons why this is just a regular landform like the ones we have on Earth. One reason is the shadowing of the landform, the second is that there are clouds and clouds could tamper with the camera, and the third s that there have been multiple pictures and only one shows a face.

The first reason is shadowing. When ever you look at something you could think its someone or something else. This can be because shadowing. Sometimes you cant see all the features, or shadows make there own. This is the case with the Face on Mars. There might be crater in the mesa that could look like eyes far away and a curve could make a mouth shape. ""Only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh"".

""...Revealing... a natural landform"". These both give evidence on how there was a change in shadow on the mesa.

The second is the clouds. Some clouds on the red planet could have gotten in the way and make it look more like a face then a mesa. ""... April '98 - a cloudy time of year for the Red planet. This gives evidence that there are more clouds then ususal on the Red Planet.

The third thing is the amount of pictures. THere have been multiple pictures of the mesa. And only one looks like a face. The other pictures show a mesa or a butte type area. "" Scientist figured it was just another Martin mesa, common enough around Cydonia. This gives evidence that there are other mesas in the area its just this one looks like a face.

That is because when the had the chance to take the picture they did and when it first appeared on a JPL web site showing that it wsa an natural landform, that it was nothing that you could now but not tell no one. Some people thought that it was still a alien head but had no proof abut it they had proof that it was an landform.

Another reason why I thnk it is an alien head is because they had digtial image 3 times bigger than te pixel size so if something was there they could see what it was, it was best Viking photo ever so they could not have said nothing. You could see almost anything out that picture even something small you could see it so there wa no way that it was an alien face.

765CD6A5D3AC,"The Face on mars was a big controversy throughout the 1970's to 2001, and still is a popular topic of conversation. Many people believe NASA was trying to hide an alien artifact by saying it's a land form, and others believe thats all it is, a landformation. NASA has been photographing this for years, trying to figure out exactly what it is, and trying to satisfy the conspiracy theorists. In 1976, they were taking photos of a region of a planet, and discovered this strange formation with the look of a face. NASA continued to research and take photos. After years of photographing and talking, they finally figured it out.

NASA discovered in 1998, that what many people thought was an alien artifact, was actually just a landformation. From the beginning, the NASA workers had two theories. Some scientists thought the Face was an alien artifact, and most thought it was a mesa, which is a natural land formation. The second theory was right, that all it was was a strange land formation and bad camera quality. There are photos that show the 3 pictures they took of the Face. One was in 1976. That was a time where most people thought it was an alien artifact, because it looked most like a face because of the blurry quality. In addition, the next picture from 1998 showed was it really was, just a land formtion. The third, from 2001, proved people who thought it was from aliens wrong. If you examine the photos closely, you can see that there are cracks in the land, that if angled the right way with clouds in the way, can show the illusion of normal face features, like eyes and a mouth. In comparison that to the photo taken in 2001, it is obvious it's nothing more then land.

Before the photo in 2001, people still thought it was an alien artifact. An article stating that, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars,"" proves a point. Why would NASA not want there to be aliens on other planets when it would benefit them so positively. If NASA really thought there were aliens, why would they show the photos to the whole world? When the first photo came out, NASA stated, ""a huge rock formation . . . which resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. They put out the photo to attract attention to mars with that caption. It explains what the formation is and how it may be mistaken as something other than rocks.

""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho, says Garvin. Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. The study was over and they stopped photographing the face once everybody understood what it was. In this paragraph, a scientist explains the mesa and compares it to a landform on earth.

In the end, the Face ends up just being a landformation, though many people hoped it would be a discovery of alien life. The photos proved that it was nothing more then a rock formation. NASA researched to find the land formation and made it clear that they also wanted it to be an alien artifact. All of the conspiracy theorists have been proven wrong, and the mystery has been solved.  ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
8A51A2AFEECE,"Is there really life on Mars? This question was asked by millions in 1976. A face was detected by Viking 1, a spacecraft, when it was gathering pictures and information for another landing spot on Cydonia. But is this really an alien? After NASA has collected other information and pictures, it is certain that the Face is just a natural landform.

The Face is a mesa, which is a common land feature on Mars. ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh (p.2)."" The shadows and poor camera quality had made the mesa look like a face. ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority for NASA...(p.6)"" Though, most scientists didn't believe that it was really an alien artifact they still were going to prove that it wasn't an alien artifact. Photographing Cydonia became a new priotity.

When scientists went back to get more pictures they still found the same answer, only more certain. It is not an alien artifact. The pictures they captured only make it more clear that it isn't. ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the firts time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos (p.7)."" After, the new picture was taken, not all were satisfied. So, NASA went back out to Cydonia to capture another shot. This time, each pixel captured 1.56 meters, which is very detailed. There is no way the picture could have been misinterpretted. The Face is just a natural landform.

Opposers say that this information is bona fide evidence. ""Some people think that the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars-evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. ""These people think that NASA is just trying to hide it from them. This is not true. ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars (p. 5)."" If NASA hopes to find life on other planets, why would they hide it? ""But not everyone was satified (p.8)."" NASA has went back to Cydonia three different times, and the thought that it is just a mesa has gotten more certain each time. The ""ten times sharper"" camera proves that is just a natural landform. Some may say that NASA is not trying hard enough to figure it out. ""We don't just pass over the Face very often (p.9)"" ""In fact, it's hard work (p.9)."" As you can tell, targeting Cydonia is not very easy, and NASA still got three shots just to prove them wrong.

The Face is just a natural landform. It is not an alien artifact, and if you don't believe me by now you aren't using logic. NASA worked hard to get the three pictures that reveal the Face. It is a mesa, which is common around Cydonia. Any landform can have shadows that look like a face, this one just happened to be on Mars, where we are looking for life.

A lot of people lately have been suspicous of my company NASA. While I don't agree with them, I do see their side. The general public has all reasons to be suspicious torwards the ""Face of Mars!"" Sounds like something from ""The Twilight Zone."" Well, Mars, though so barren, might has well be considered the earth's twin sister... or brother. The two planet's sufaces have shown some interesting simularities, like water remnants and climates. Not to mention volcanoes. This is where we find the reason behind the face of Mars!

On our planet earth, we have land structures called ""Mesas."" These elevated lands are found in the ""American West"", where the surrounding deserts (used to be oceans in theory), are now filled with canyons, rock flats, salt flats, mesas, and other forms only found there. Mars might as well have a northwest region where one could find earthlike simularities. This may as well be the reason behind the face. Also, one should note that the shadows may be rocks making a shadow from the sunlight. Another logical explanation to look at France. Shaped like a boot, it is just a land form that naturally occured, looking like something we know.

My company would also like to state that this really ""isn't"" a cover-up. In true fact, the discovery of other life or remnants of one such time would be positive to us, and to our projects. So, say what you want. Believe in what you think, but we at NASA belive this isn't alien. Just another simularity between Mars and Earth.                                                                      ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The thing about someone putting something on the earth is you could tell that someone or something put it there Im going to be presuading you that the face on the land is just a naturl land formation and has not been put there by a living creture such as an alien.

The face that has formed on the earth over the years is just a natural land form. I think it is just a natural landform because you can see in the pictures up above how it changes of the year. The face changes of the years because the way the land movement is. You can see that it has not been put there by somone because the way it has changed over the years that it has formed.

The reason I think it has formed over the years is because if you look at the pictures look how much the formation from 1998 to 2001. If it was put there by someone, it would of been alot more clear that a someone made the face. The face appeared because of how the land moves.

I hope you can agree with me that the face on the earth has just formed over the years and wasnt put there by some living creature such as an alien. We have no proof that aliens even excist so that is more proof that it has just formed throughtout the years .",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
A6504C463F7E,"Have you ever thought the ""Face on Mars"" might be made by something extraterstrial? Well I'm here to prove to you its not.

Here are my three examples that prove that its just a mesa. First there are mesas on Earth and in pictures fom Mars theres a lot. Second NASA took pictures of the mesa in 2001 and used ""high resolution images and 3D altimetry"" to show what it really looks like, and it doesnt look like a face. Lastly it would be beneficial to NASA for them to say its aliens.

One reason why it's just a mesa is, theres lots of mesas on Earth and Mars. An example of this would be ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". This is why its not a face but just a mesa.

Secondly NASA re-took photos of the ""face"". In the picture its a lot clearer then the one took in 1976. They did this by using ""New high-resolution images and 3D altimetry"" to clear the picture up. This is another reason why its not a alien made object but a mesa.

Lastly it would be beneficial for NASA to say that it was aliens. it would beneficial to them because people would be giving more money to them to try and find the aliens. this is yet another reason why it's not aliens.

To conclude these are the reasons why its not aliens. NASA would get more funding if they said it was aliens. They took a clearer picture of it in 2001 and it proved it wasnt a face. Lastly we have lots of mesas on Earth and someone siad theyd seen one like The Face on Mars by a river in Idaho.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
AA08B576D8B0,"Is the ""Face on Mars"" really a natural landform? Seeing from pictures and other kinds of photographic things can you really tell? There may be alien markings or there may not be any markings.

I say that the ""Face on Mars"" is in fact, a natural landform. There is no alien markings to be seen from a picture. For example, """"As a rule of thumb you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the groud or Egyptian-style pryamids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""

So, if there were alien markings on this natural landform you would be able to see them. This was stated by Jim Garvin who is a chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program. The picture uses the camera's absolute maximum resolution.

Many people said from the photo took in 1998, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze."" The photo in 1998 was taken on a cloudy winter day on Mars and caused a haze to appear over the camera. By going in 2001 on a nice sunny day on Mars, the picture was clear and easy to see. You can tell in the picture that there is no alien markings of any kind. The picture was took with great resolution and couldn't be better.

In conclusion, there could be a possibility of aliens making this natural landform but, it could also just be a natural landform. It should not be famous for a conspiracy theory that it was made by aliens, simply of its shape. This landmark, looking like a human face, is just a natural landform.

The conspiracy theorists thought that it could have been made by aliens.

One way we know that they ""face"" was natural and not made by aliens was we have landforms like that on Earth.

What Garvin really said was ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This also proves that it was not made by aliens, because the picture they took is very precise.

The reporter who was sent here was clearly around my age. He still had the eagerness, the thirst to fulfill his new job at some big-shot online journal, that all of the typical just-graduated liberal arts majours hold those first few years in the real world.

Obviously, I am not one of those people. At 23 I graduated from Oxford with a degree in all the sciences needed to allow me to come here. Working at NASA has been my lifelong dream. It sounds so incredibly cheesy but I actually have had this.. passion for our solar system since I was in primary school.

Also in 1998 the JPL website revealed that it was just a natural landform and not made by aliens. Also NASA would be just as excited to reveal that another life form has been found, that wouldn't be a kept secret.

So far we have no real proof that aliens exist. If there were aliens wouldn't we know by now? There are lots of alien conspiracies but nothing that proves aliens exist. UFO spottings are just the same. You may think theres an alien in there but whos to say its not just a flying frisbee. And the crop circles how do you know the farmer doesn't just like to have a nice looking crop.

Lots of people believe in aliens but what are they basing these beliefs from, one blurry picture? We can say there may be evidence of aliens but no proof.

When the next Mars Global Surveyor flew over we got an even better picture. Lots of people were anxious to find out what the story behind this face was. Later theJPL website revealed something that shocked, relieved, saddened, and angered the people. The website had said that there was no alien artifact just a natural land form. How after all of that can you still think there are aliens? Well some people still believe. There are all kinds of things people think that show us there are aliens.

Maybe there was once aliens, but the facts just don't prove that to be true, therefore it is indeed just a natural landform.

We do have many images of the Face. The very first one that was taken in 1976 does indeed look like a face, but over the years wtith new technology it doesn't look like a face anymore. Now you may say that it's because of erosion and blah blah, but it's not.

With our better technology it clearly shows that it is indeed not a face, therefore maybe you should stop believing it is.

If that still didn't convince you then this might. Simply if there was ever life on any other planet in our solar system we, NASA, would highly benifit from it.

BA9C03F5EACB,"As of 1976, there has been ¨a photo from Viking 1¨ showing what appears to be face on Mars. This information came straight from NASA back when they first discovered the face. This is well related to the topic around aliens and alien theories. People have believed forever that aliens exist somewhere is the universe. Then recently becuase of the picture showing the face on Mars strengthening their beleifs. They have said, ""the Face is bonafide evidence of life on Mars.¨ Many people believe this face was a monument created by aliens so, here´s why they are wrong.

This photo was first taken sometime in 1976. It is a photo of small region of mars with a couple of formations. But one formation sticks out like a tall man in an elementary school. This picture was taken at the right angle at the right time. It makes it look a face with the angle and shadows. And many people believed it to be a monument made by extratellestular figures. Another reason why they believe for it to be made from aliens is because, ¨What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West.¨

Their is a lot of people that would disagree with belief of this face being real. They would believe this way because they would it´s childish to believe that a rock formation on a foreign planet could ever possibly be made by aliens. Another reason why is because if it does resemble a earth-like formation that was not man made, that means the face was made by aliens, it was just an act of nature. It is physically challenging to make a formation, the shape of a human face, on a planet way far away from its neighboring planets.

People have also taken more recent pictures of the face. One in 1998 and another one in 2001. The newest one from 2001 is pretty old but gives the most recent information. It has the highest resolution of any picture of that face. In this picture, it is zoomed in more than the original photo and a lot more clear than the first one, their is a lot more detail. But in this photo, it doesn look like a human, it has more of a resemblance of a lion. But also, it looks to be more natural than before because the higher resolution and less blur.

Again, the people that have believed that the face wsa alien made rock formation were wrong. It is merely just a natural formation that has face-like features that was believed to be a face because of a shadow and a good camera angle.

NASA's discovery is leading to an argument over whether it was formed by aliens or if it is just a natural landform. The text states, ""The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien amrkings were hidden by haze."" This evidence shows how people continue to believe that the Face could've have alien marking all around it, but they couldn't have been spotted because it was winter on the Red Planet so it was very cloudy to spot anything like that. Then on April 8, 2001, Mars Global Surveyor got close enough for a second look. The text states ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size."" This proves that if there were any Egyptian like pyramids or any alien type monument, you would be able to see it.    ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The only reason it could have been formed was from the weather on planet because we have not found alien life form on mars or any other planet. It could mean that mars is just like earth because it has some wierd unational design in the crust or on the surface. In the article ""Unmasking The Face on Mars they said that what they have found is that the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-Landforms common around the American West.""

The scientist have already study and sone test and even scamed the whole planet for alien life form and there was non because they didn't make it.

I am not saying that I don't believe in aliens,I am just saying that aliens did not form this face into the surface of mars. I saying is that the landform shaped it self into a shape of a face. I still believe that there is aliens out there but I have yet to find them. Once again Aliens did not make this object on mars.

Even though scientist have found face marks on mars doesn't mean aliens made it. That land could have done something to make it. The only reason I say that because it hapens on earth too. It happens in the American West and it is very common for it. Scientist have not found alien form on Mars. I am sure we will still keep looking at mars to find other forms like it and we will keep looking for alians too. Even though you see picture of different forms on mars or other planet don't freak out or say it is aliens,just go look for facts and eviedence first and talk to some scientist and have them look at it.

Evidence say in the fifth passage say that NASA would wather hide, and say that conspiracy theorists.

The monument has properties tht make it look like is has a natural human face. The shadows give it a 3D effect to look like a person from Earth. to eally see that it is not a face you will need to focuse on the picture, to not let the shadow make you think it is a face. The face is only a illusion of the mind, some people say the face looks like a Egyptian Pharaoh.

NASA thinks that if there were a alien civilization on Mars that it would be a popularity increase for the big red planet. People that still think that their was life on Mars defend by saying that it would help the budget for themselves. The Face on Mars became popular and started to get on talk show, radios, and magazines. Soon NASA wanted to let the conspircy take place and leave the Face alone.

The Face of Mars could have been made by alien because of the unexplainable things on Earth itself. In the last passage it states that i could have been made bye aliens. Compared to all of the things on Earth. It could be a possiblity of aliens making the Face on Mars. For example, in the last passage it says that Garvins say, ""That it slike the lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on a Mars.""

The head you could found was from two miles from end to end. The face on Mars is found in 41 degress north martian latitude and also it was winter.

A few days later there was a change that mars is becoming a pop icon. Scientist found out that it was a Martian mesa and that those shadows made it look like an Egyptain Pharaoh.

Do you believe that aliens created the Face of Mars? Let me tell you, they didn't. Aliens are not here & they didn't create this Face on Mars. Plenty of research is found to back it up too.

First, research has been concluded & done to prove that this is a natrual landform. In an article called 'Unmasking the Face on Mars' it states, ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web sit, revealing...a natrual landform. There was no alien monument after all."" Websites aren't enough for some people though.

Next, this face on mars simulates some landforms on Earth. Therefore, it would be a natrual cause that happened. It states in the article of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", ""What the picture actually shws is the Martian equivalent of a buttle or mesa-landforms common around the American West. 'It reminds me most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.' says Gravin. 'That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa around the same height as the Face on Mars.'"" By reading this, it is making it clear that this landform is somewhat common. It stated that landforms such as the Face on Mars is common around the American West. If it can happen on Earth, why can't it happen in outer space?

On the other side, the ""Face on Mars"" has attracted a lot of attention, especially in the social world. It states in the article of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", ""The 'Face on Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It starred in a Hollywood Film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows-even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars."" People seem to think that they can believe everything they hear & see on television or on magazines or even in movies. Presenting us all with fake gossip & fake news is how these businesses get money. They know, one person will believe it, leading to thousands more. We tend to believe in the 'juicy' filled drama. Not everything you hear out in the world is true. I know, I'd rather believe real scientist, than businesses thirsty for money.

I also say that each picture being taken could of had a better quality camera or maybe could've had a different angle that makes it look like a face is there. As it said in the text the camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds just to see that it was a face. The clouds could have given shadows that made it looked like there was a face imprint. The face could've been just another Martian mesa, in the text it says mesas are common around Cydonia. NASA decided to make this public which made more people believe this is real .

5A1E6E8CDE7F,"Introduction:This essay is going to be about convincing readers that the Face is just a natural landform. It all started when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was on the planet and was snapping pictures,as it was snapping pictures it noticed a shadow of a humans face,in other words a big enormous head.

paragraph2:Mars is a planet anyone can travel too not just humans but martians and other strange creatures that we dont know about. Well it is just a natural landform because they got all of the evedience they needed to prove that it was no sign of an alien. Cydonia did everything they could to prove everyones suspicious but not everyone was satisfied they still thought that it was signs on mars that they saw a martian.

Paragraph3:In my opinion if i was a scientist at NASA discussing the Face with someone i would kinda like go close to snap better pictures to prove innocents on my behalf to cover me and to prove everyones suspicious so it wouldnt have to be that big of an argument. They did a good thing by zooming the picture in three times bigger and all of the other objects in the picture,they saw clear so they had to see clearly that it wasn't an alien in the picture.

0C0C473FA794,"I truthfully believe this is not created by aliens. Even if the artifact was created by aliens we have no proof of actually seeing them. NASA denies that there is not any other logical proof of aliens, but NASA's budget really wishes there was an ancient civilization. It would mean great publicity and further exploration into science. As a scientist learning about this you may believe anything within earshot. Whatever could seem logical, could not really be what is really right. Confusing as this argument sounds, I really believe that aliens never would have made this artifact. Could something like this happen? Do they really exsist?

Nature is different on mars, how is this effective? Mars has different climates and weather storms that we don't experience on earth. Maybe, the ""face"" is a weathered rock and when shadows cross over it it really looks like a face. Does that seem truthful enough to you? Or even believable? Sometimes when we look at clouds they can be different shapes as what we think they look like. To you, this is artifact that needs further examination. If we could excavate it from Mars we could further our studies on what truly made this rock really look like a face. How could this happen, you may ask? The cost of getting another spaceship to Mars and having a crew does cost alot of money, I understand. NASA made the last possible missions come true, would we be putting the people in that spaceship in danger?

Mars really isn't that safe, that may be why people dont life on Mars without a suit and oxygen tank. Because something bad could really happen up there, and we need contact with earth to tell whats going on. That may put people in danger sending the crew up there. We can only think and hope that the artifact was created by aliens. The face on Mars is an icon for magazines and movies like ""The Martian"" and books like ""The Lunar Chronicles"". A single dicovered thing can turn sellers into money-makers easliy. All these fanatsy in books and movies, really can make us believe what we believe.

Pictures say that shadows make it look like a face. To me the artifact looks like a giant rock, with holes in it. When the shadows of clouds do come along it looks like a face. We may reallly never know who, what, or how this confusing landmark was made. The whole solar system moves around the sun, sometimes they said that they couldnt find Cydonia. Its stuck behind the cloud storms, but this face is really a natural landform on Mars. Now pictures can be photoshopped can't they? If this really was a face why does it look the way it does? From early pictures they turned out blurry and you cant really see the face. I still dont see the face.

Some say the camera doesnt lie, well in this case it may. If aliens were there making these faces wouldnt there be more? it would be a culture to them, or a ceremonial thing. We may never know. All these questions have no answer to them. What is really happening on Mars? Why were the artifacts made, but its really something we will never understand.

If aliens did make the artifact where are they? Wouldnt we see something about them or some weird signals coming from them? Aliens dont really exsist, as much as the subject wraps around our brains, it really leaves us clueless on what we know and what we dont know. Since we really have no proof, I believe that aliens did not make this artifact, found on Mars. I could be wrong to some people, but i believe my claim is true. There really may be a civilization on Mars if we could really think about it and further our studies. But for now i believe this artifact is really just a weathered rock on the face of Mars.

7FC58DA53B39,"The Face on Mars is not an alien creation. It is a natural landform. Evidence to support this claim includes: this landform is similar to ones found on Earth that were created naturally, the technology is extremely advanced to where we would know if alien life existed, and NASA would share any evidence of life on Mars if any is found.

The Face on Mars is much like natural landforms found here on Earth, specifically in the western part of North America. It is called a mesa. In the article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" Garvin says, ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Because the atmospheres and climates of Earth and Mars are similar, it is very possible that the same type of natural landforms could be created on both planets. There has even been evidence supporting the claim that water previously existed on Mars, which could have caused erosion that formed the Face.

Technology has improved drastically within the last few decades. Specific to this research, cameras are part of that new and improved technology. NASA was able to capture outstanding photographs of the Face. It is stated in the article, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" With these sharper images, the Face no longer looked like a face. The conditions were different as well. On a cloudless day, Mars Global Surveyor captured more images of the Face. It looked like an ordinary landform.

There has never been any solid official evidence of life on the Red Planet. People think NASA may be hiding their findings of aliens on Mars. However, in paragraph five of the article, it says, ""... evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" NASA would definetly share any evidence of alien life with the public because that would be great publicity for them. It would be huge news that would spread across the world. NASA would benifit greatly from this because of all the money it would bring in.

In conclusion, the Face on Mars is not an alien formation, but a natural landform that happened to resemble a human face at one point. Some people will continue to believe that aliens do exist, but as of right now, no solid evidence has proven that theory. These are just a few reasons that support the Face as being a landform that was created naturally, but NASA has many more. As more technology is developed and NASA delves deeper into uncovering the secrets of Mars, we will anxiously await any new discoveries. ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
C7956D9BF4BE,"Do you guys belive in aliens? Well,I got a friend over at NASA who does. And I'm here to tell you all about the Face on Mars. You know,the one that's been all over books and magazines for like the past 25 years. A lot of people think it was created by aliens,but I don't. Let me tell you why.

My first piece of evidence to put an end to this ludacrisy is that in April of 1998,Mars Global Surveyor flew over the an area of the Mars where the Face was spotted,Cydonia. Michael Malin and his orbit camera team took a picture of the face that was ten times sharper than the original photo from 1976. The picture,to everyones suprise but mine,revealed that there was no alien monument. The picture only showed a natural landform. However the phot was taken during a cloudy time of the year on Mars.

So,on April 8,2001 another photo was taken. This time a cloudless summer day in Cydonia. Mars Global Surveyor used a camera that had each pixel span 1.56 meters. So even if the picture had a plane on it or small shacks,you could still see it. When the photo was taken it shows the Martian that resembles American lamdforms called buttes and messas. It even reminded a scientist of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.

The face on mars, is it an object made my aliens or just a natural landform?

First of all, as myself being a NASA scientist, I believe it's a natural landform. I think it's a natural landform because there has been no evidence of life on Mars. NASA took a picture of the landform with a camera that can make the image three times bigger. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small rocks, you could see what they were""(11)! Also it could be a natural landform because in Idaho there is a natural landform that looks similair to the one on Mars. If it was an object made by aliens us scientist's at NASA would be able to know.

On the other hand, many people think it's an object that was created by aliens. Many people think that because its so similair to a person's face. The face on Mars is located at a place where it is usualy cloudy, ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze""(8).

""It has starred in a Hollywold film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows and even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years""(5)! This shows us that people are excited and what to know about the face on Mars.

075539F6E57D,"In this article, ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"". Many people believe that this imprint of a human beings' face was sculpted by aliens. In this essay, I will provide many reasons why this imprint was just a natural landform that looked identical to a human face.

Scientist have discovered that this ""Face"" on Mars was just a natural landform. Many people are trying to say that the face was created by aliens. There are many ways that we could prove that aliens DID NOT create this fasinating landform. From far away, this imprint looks exactly like a human face. If you focuse hard enough on this sculpture, you could indentify its eyes, mouth, nose and head shape.

One of the many reasons that this artifact was not created by aliens is because, provided in the article, back on April 5th, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time. Scientist studied the artifact from afar, yet, they were still able to see the face. One of the scientist, Michael Malin, and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took pictures of this marvelous sculpture. As Michael looked closer into each picture, he discovered that the creation was not carved that way in any sort. He discovered that the artifact was just a landform that began to age that way.

Another way to prove this artifact was not created by aliens is, there was no one there at the planet Mars. Scientist looked all over the planet, circled it for a long period of time. There was no foot prints, or any marks on this planet. Many believed that no matter how hard they searched, the solution would come out possitive. No one came and created this impressive land.

In the passage it says on April 8, 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Each pixel spanned about 1.56 meters in 2001. The best Viking photo in 1976 was measured out to be 43 meters per pixel. This is when they knew for a fact that this landform was not something anyone else was able to make. This was all just a huge coincedense that there was a face imprinited on our called, ""Red Planet"".

This is why we should believe that ""the Face"" was just a natural landform. All facts has proven, that this creation was just part of Mars. There was no clear explaination that an alien would come and create this. If aliens tend to exist, there's no possible way they would know the facial structures of a human face.

DB6C27832C62,"Many conspiracy theorists say that The Face On Mars is proof of alien life. Some even say that NASA is trying to hide evidence of aliens. The face is nothing more then an illusion though, caused by shadows. Although technology was not advanced when the first photo was published, more recent pictures have proven that this is nothing more then a crater with shadows, creating eyes, a nose, and a mouth.

In 1976 when the first photo was released people quickly began to theorize that alien life was on Mars, but this is simply not true. The picture was taken in low resolution and was very blurry. The Viking 1 Spacecraft was circling the planet searching for landing sites for The Viking 2, when a landform that resembled an enormous face was spotted. This enormous two mile long ""face"" is nothing more then a mesa.

In 1998 a new picture of the mesa was released, but people were still not satisfied. Since it was winter while the mission was launched there was a thick haze over the Red Planet. Many think that NASA is trying to hide evidence that there IS lifeforms on other planets, but this is not true. We as scientists wish to share information on space with the public, but we will not spread false rumors about alien lifeforms when there are none.

On April 8, 2001 we launched another mission to take a more high-resolution photo. Since it was summer there were no clouds to hide the mesa. Mars Global Surveyor rotated 25 degrees to center the Face in the feild of view. They then took a photo using the camera at maximum resolution. After all the hype about alien life on Mars since the first photo was released, it was clear to see that the Face was nothing but a mesa.

After years of research and three missions to take photos of Mars, it is clear to see that the Face was no evidence of life on another planet. The Face is very similar to something like on Earth.

First, the people who say that there is really a civilization, were probably sitting in the sun to long. They also may not believe in the Bible. It says that God came once to die for all mankind. If that's not true than wouldn't he have to go to every single planet to die for those people too? It really just doesn't add up! Second, the people that say that it is really only a natural landform are probably more acurate. While the Face does on fact look like someone built it doesn't mean that there are people living there. The Bible does mention aliens, but not of that sort. It refers to them as people who have denied God and gone their own ways. Third, the article states that the Face has ""become a pop icon"". How can this really be true? They don't know if it is a planet that has martians living on it or not! People are saying that NASA is hiding what they know about it and that defenders of NASA's budget, wish that there was an ancient civilization living on Mars.

As a Christian, I believe that God has created me and everyone else on earth for His glory. There are just to many questions we could ask. For example, If there is life on Mars, of any kind, why haven't they contacted us? Are there people not intelligent enough to think of a way to reach us?

It then became a pop icon.

Some people think the Face is evience of life on Mars. Theorists say NASA was trying to hide the evidece, where defenders of the NASA budget ""wish there was an ancient civilization on mars."" So, in 1998 scientists flew over Cydonia taking pictures of what many call the ""Face"" ten times sharper than before. When those pictures were released it was revealed to be a natural landform. But many argued otherwise.

For the third time in 2001, scientists went to take another look. The camera they had used proved to be much more accurate than the one used in the first Viking photo in 76. The pixels of the camera were 1.56 meters compared to 43 meters per pixel.

It is proven that the picture actaully showed butte or mesa landform. These landforms are very common around the West. The landform found was even compared to ""the Snake River Plain of Idaho."" Which is a dome about the same size size as the Face on Mars.

In 1976 a spaceshuttle named the Viking one was taking pictures of the Red planet also known as Mars. To find a possable landing place for its sister Viking two. Vikking one was scanning one day and found something on the surface of Mars that resembled a face of a human. The people who were getting the pictures of Mars that were back on Earth were shocked to see a human face appear on another planet.

In the passage it says "" It looks like something that aliens made"". Like I said some people think its from aliens but, thats not logical. If aliens were real than I would believe it. Than again in the passage it also says that The ""face"" could be a mesa. Whenever they took a picture of it ten times sharper than the one before people still wouldn't believe that it is a rock and not an alien creation. When they say alien creation they think of an alien standing there and cutting into rock to make it look like a human face with a really big head.

In the passage it says that it is just a mesa. Some scientist think the way the shaddows are it makes the mesa look like a Egyptian Pharaoh. The passage says that they don't see it often and that they use cameras that go small strip by small strip all over the planet and take pictures. Since the Face on Mars has been discovered it has been popular it starred in movies, books, magazines, and people talk about it in talk shows on the radio, also people talk about in the line at he grocery story. It was discovered just about fourty years ago.

In my opinion I think it is some rocks that got covered up by dust overtime. If people think that it was created by aliens than that's their opinion. It has been scientifically proven that it was not created by aliens. If it was made by aliens then why would the aliens want us humans to know that there is life on that planet. But some pictures of the Face on Mars actually looks like a face but, that could just be the way the planet is getting light and reflected by the sun. So in my opinion I think it is a rock and all the people who think other wise they don't have proof to show that it is a alien creation.

So in conclusion this face on mars isn't a alien creation it is just rocks. In the passage it says that its a lava dome that takes place of an isolated mesa about the same size of the Face on mars which is two miles. So to all the people that think that it is an alien creation, its not. To be honest I think its just dust build up in some places, so when theres a shadow it shines off of it and makes a face that everyone freeks out about. Its just a big rock that does nothing I don't see why it would be a big deal in the first place. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
3420E1D78D9B,"Is the face on Mars alien or just another natrual landform? Do we know if Mars isn't crawling with extra-terrestial beings? Yes. Yes we do. In the following paragraphs I will prove the fact that the face on Mars if in fact just a natrually formed landform. Then I will say why many people speculate if it is alien.

To begin with, many people say the face on mars could be a sign of alien life and that extra-terretial beings are calling out to us with their mound-like pyramids. It can't be possible. First, it is proven that there are no signs of any alien markings on it. The text says,""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were."" Second, it has been proven that it is similar to many mesa or buttes in the western united states. The text says,"" what the picture actually shows is the Martian equizelant of a butte or a mesa- landforms common around the American West."" Lastly, the face has been taken over and over again and every time it becomes clearer and clearer every time. This is because the technology has started getting better so the world can stat proving things to be false. One example, is the Martian face.

To conclude, many speculations have been made this is resonable because the picture wasn't originally clear and the second one was taken with clouds in the Martian atmosphere, but still the third picture shows that scientifaclly it is only a landform on the palnet of mars.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
1F1CAA37BE07,"How can NASA want to hide this evidence if they wish there was an ancient civilization? The people that think that are conspiracy theorists. They dont have any evidence that NASA would hide this. If they wanted to hide it why would they give it out to the public a few days after they found it? Lets talk about where the face is located.

Many other Martian Mesas are in that area so it wouldnt be surprising if it was just another one. All though it would be enchanting to find out that there is life on Mars, the land mass is not enough evidence to support that theory that aliens or some sort of life built the face. Lets talk about the size of the face.

The face is too big to be a face of someone or something anyways. Unless there is a new species on Mars that is that big or maybe it is a ancient burial site like the ones that the egyptions made. The pictures would be able to see any life next to the face. They would be able to see if there were any shacks maybe house or aircrafts of some sort. Lets talk about what scientists think.

The Snake river Plain of Idaho is about the same size as the face and it reminds him of it. The face could have just been a couincadince. The face also could not have been. Small meteors could have crashed into the mesa to create the facial features of the face. In pictures of the face you can see a lot of different crates next to it. There a small craters and large craters. it wouldn't be surprising if it got hit by a crater.

You can believe that aliens or some sort of life form have created the face or you can believe that it is just natural. The choice is yours. But before you make asumptions you should do your research first. Those are the main facts that i can give you to make a disition on your own. You might even end up doing more research. If you find any facts that can support your claim that a life form has created this please let me know.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Some people may disagree, but the face is just a rock formation. There has been no discovery of aliens yet to think this had something to do with aliens. Phototgraphs show that its a rock formation.

In 1998 NASA took photograpghs of the ""face"" while orbiting Mars. They then posted the pictures online. When the image appeared on the website, the photo revealed a natural landform. There was no ancient civilization monument.

So, Is there an actual head on Mars? No, it is just a rock formation, and when light hits it, it produces shadows that look like eyes, mouth, and nose.

FB7A42A10DCE,"The concept of aliens is a topic that some of us believe and some of us do not. Whether it has to do with how aliens may have affected how Earth was created or that there are other living organisms on planets other than Earth. Most scientists have used reasonable research to discover that aliens are not real, but yet there are still some scientists that believe they are in fact real. Based on the photos taken of the Face, aliens did not create this structure, it is simply just a natural landform.

In 1976, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft visited Mars and discovered the Face while snatching photos for landing areas for the Viking 2 ship. It looked as though it was the shape of a head, which is why it is known as the Face. This formation was gigantic, measuring almost two miles across. Something so giant couldn't have been formed from aliens, especially if it resembles a head, symbolizing that it may be an imprint of an actual alien. As they studied the photos of the Face, they began to realize how similar its features were to those of a human's face, or this case, what could be an alien. These facial features were then recognized to be just shadows, which adds to the fact that the imprint of a human, or alien face, could not have been formed. A formation this large cannot resemble that of a human, nethertheless an alien.

For twenty-five years, ""The Face of Mars"" was a famous attraction, attracting many people to be interested and cause an even broader range of thoughts about how this landform was created. As more people become engaged in this unusual formation, NASA continued to snap photos of the Face to uncover more information about what it really was and how it was really created. Later on, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team took one more picture that had ten times the resolution that the orginal Viking images had. When this picture was viewed by many on a web site, it then revealed that it was, indeed, a natural landform and there was no evidence of aliens, as many people thought. Information from the several images that were taken establish that this structure is a natural landform, and not a creation from aliens.

Even though images proved that the Face was a natural landform and not something created by aliens, there still remained people who didn't believe this concept. At the time the most recent photo was taken, it was winter on the planet, and the Face on Mars was located in an area that consisted of a cloudy region. Those who still believed that aliens created the Face also believed that this area of clouds could have affected the picture that was taken during that time. The scientists claimed that it isn't an easy task to find the Face and capture a decent picture of it when possible, but still yearned to capture another shot to prove that aliens had not created it. So, on a summer day that consisted of no clouds, the team captured another photo with the maximum resolution. Because of the outstanding resoluation of the photo, it then again proved that it was simply anatural landform and that aliens did not play a part in it's creation.

Throughout the journey of discovering whether this creation was formed by aliens or that it was a natural landform the scientists and photos taken proved that there were no aliens. Although somemay still believe that there were aliens, these photos demonstrate real evidence that there was not. Like the scientists said, it was very similar to a landform on Earth, that is created naturally. Because of this discovery of the Face, scientists have been given the chance to explore the realmsof creations on other planets and prove that they cannot be formed by aliens, but simply by the natural occurences that take place on that planet.

We actually support our theories,like the face on Mars.

When the first image of the ""face on mars"" was released in 1976 it became a pop icon. People believed it was alien made and think their is alien structures on the planet.

I'm here to tell you that is not true,as you may know the most recent pictures from 1998 and 2001 you may see the images a little clearer and you are able to see the surrounding ground of the''face'',so if their was any alien activity or any alien structures down thier im pretty sure we would see it.

Although it was disproven that it was a face built by aliens it still makes some people subscribe to the consperocy theories surrounding this Martian Mesa.

Some of the claims hat support that this is a natural occurance and not a monument built by aliens is that when in different lighting it turns from a face to just a normal mesa. But, of course, some people don't believe this and they say that NASA is just trying to cover it up. In responce to these accusations NASA said that it would be amazing if it actually was an alien monument because it would give new light onto exploring the Red Planet.

In the text the author states that to achieve the photo that proved the face was not actually a face took extreme detail to get perfect and that if it was a face or their was any other buidling around the mesa it would be as clear as day. Also, even here on planet Earth there are examples of these mesa such as the one in Idaho that is a lava dome about the same height as the face.

The landform int a real face because if you compare the ""face"" to an Earth rock in that shape they would look the same, until you add some light from the sun causing shadows, and it would include the facial parts of any human man or woman.

The people still believed it still had something to do with the aliens because of where it was located.

Proof has been found from high tech cameras that shows that this is just a landform and was not created by aliens. After we found the what seemed to be alien markings we decided to look again. Its has the same height as some natural landforms like the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. If they was anything that could have left a mark by aliens we would've been able to see it.

You can dipect the size of something in a photo 3 time larger in real life. So if there was anything on Mars that shows aliens were there than we would definately be able to see it, but there is none so that leads us to the conclusion that this odd looking figure is just a natural landform and not built by anybody.

To conclude my arguement on whether or not this strange looking figure is actually made by extraterrestrials or just there by nature I belive this is just a natural landform. There is proof and that it was not made by aliens and none that shows aliens made this figure. We used our best equipment to find an answer by research and strongly belive in our answer.

6C0C9C30C8E7,"Some people may think that the Face is not a natural landform but I am here to give you reasons why the Face IS a natural landform. The reasons I am going to give you are going to be in the paragraphs below, hope you like it and think

''which opinion is better in this essay?''.

The first reason the Face is a natural landform is because 25 years ago something happened on Mars, NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship ''Viking 2'', but when the camera spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face, then they saw an enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a fregion of the Red Planet called '' Cydonia''.

Another reason that the Face is a natural landform is because after a few days , NASA unveiled the image which had shadows forming the illusion of eyes, nose and the mouth. But since it became so popular, the picture has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, etc. They also said that defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars. But scientists believed that the Face was an alien artifact.

The last reason is that thousands of anxious people were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing a natural landform. But not everyone believed that.

The camera on board MGS had to peer thrrough wispy clouds to see the face, they say perhaps alien markings were hidden by a haze. People are also saying, ''We just dont pass over the face very often''.

But not everyone can be right because some people think its not a natural landform because it could be just a haze from something that was there at that specific moment and time to show that the face was there when it could have really been just a rock and not the Face after all. More reasons to this is that,even though it looked like a face...it couldnt have been, people couldve just seen the face that wasnt really there.

In Conclusion, people have different opinions on what they see and what they dont see in certain pictures. Some people see the face, some people dont see the face at all and that can be a good thing and a bad thing for some people who have different things to say about a certain subject. The Face couldve just been a rock in some peoples opinions, but some people think that it wasnt just a rock, it was an outline of a face.      ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Although some people believe that alien-life or some life-form has occurred or is still occurring to this day. I believe that the face figure is just another natural formed landmass like several we have on earth. For instance the Middle Butte found in the Snake River Plain of Idaho has a lava dome which takes form of a messa.

In paragraph eleven of ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", Garvin says, ""As a thumbs rule, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger then the pixel size, So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what there were!"" This explains that there is no way of showing or providing any evidence of aliens or lifeform on Mars.

The author also mentions that Garvin says, ""It;s not easy to target Cydonia. In fact, it's hard work."" In this paragraph nine it also consentrates about the angle it is looked apon. I feel like if it was hard to find the perfect angle and measurements to take a closer look at the face, there could have been mistakes made without realization.

Even though no one knows whether or not if there was or life on Mars or if there still is. The likelyhood of this theory is very low. There would have to be a water supply, nutrients to feed off of, sunlight, shelter, etc. for any living organisms to survive.

Everyone should be allowed to have their own beliefs, but sometimes people believe in things that are hardly believeable. This could help save time and convience for in the future whenever NASA finds solid evidence that there is no evidence of aliens on planet Mars.

We scientist over in NASA are trying to find ways to expand human nature. People keep saying Aliens did this and thats making us want to explore this more even though the theory can't be supported. We spend billions of dollars a year trying to find these answers to lifes mysteries.

We even supported this in with facts about water on Mars and the mini volcanoes. The landform was a coquencedence that it was caught by our cameras and the fact about it is if this landform happened by aliens wouldn't the camera caught it? The face was first saw in 1976 and it looked like a wave of water splashed over it and dried. The volcanoes could have also erupted and hardened so the landform would have to have been there to heating and cooling of molten lava.

Even though the alien evidence can be proven it still is in the picture. The landform could have been a sign that the aliens put out and wanted help. It could have also been a sign for what is to come. The alien therory isnt well thought out, but in life anything can happen.

4991D7F4664D,"""Is this a face created by aliens or a landform"" many wonder. This specific picture of a so called ""face"" on Mars has captured the eyes of many. The picture that NASA has showen or released to us resembles a face like landform on Mars in 1976, but in the picture that was taken in 2001 clearly shows it was just a landform. Many people thought that there was possible life on Mars, but they are yet to discover if there really is. Many landforms like this so called ""face"" are found in the American West.

This ""face"" is just another theory that there is life on Mars.

Many people want to believe that there is life on Mars, so when the Vicking took the photo it just made them think that there was a greater chance of life on Mars.

There has been many thoughts on if this picture could really be a face or just a landform, but with improved technology NASA discovered that this ""face"" had occured naturally, not created by aliens. A face that was created by aliens wouldn't stick out as far as this natural landform, nor would it have stayed on Mars for over 30 years. Landfroms usually occur naturally, so who knows how long this ""face'' could have been there when there were photographs taken of it , but then again it could have just popped up the day that Vicking landed there.

In 2001 they went back to see if this was an actual face or just a landform and with the higher quality cameras they could simply zoom in, which they did, and see that this was just a naturally occuring landform that formed over time. Naturally occuring lanforms happen over periods of time and that is simply what happened on Mars, it just happened to look a lot like a face.

In conclusion, this ''face'' is just a natural landform that formed over the years. There has yet to be life discovered on Mars, just landforms that have shapes of faces. Aliens did not create this face, nor was there an actual face in the Mars surface. There should be more pictures taken of this ''face'' so that it will prove that it occured naturally. Therefore, there are no faces or life on Mars surface.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
FEAE1B329876,"Many people believe in conspiracy theories,that may sometimes not be backed by evidence. Some examples of this are Bigfoot or aliens. Another conspiracy theory is of the face on Mars. In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet, when it came a across something that appered to look a lot like a human face. Many conspiracy theorists believe that this landform on Mars has to do with aliens.

There is evidence that shows that the face on Mars has nothing to do with aliens. Modern technolgy has allowed us to further investigate on theories like this. ""Micheal Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing... a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" (paragraph 7). In 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor was able to take a closer look. ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixal size.""

With the last visit of the Face on Mars in 2001, scientists were able to get a closer look at the landform. They were able to compare the landform on Mars to the landforms here on Earth. "" What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or messa-landforms common around the American West. It reminds me most of the MIddle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"". (paragraph 12). With this evidence we can tell that the landforms on Mars are simliar to the ones on Earth. Making it more likely to be caused by natural events in Mars's atmosphere.

Scientists at NASA, have enough knowledge and have done enough reshearch to differniate if events or landforms, like the Face, happen natrually or unaturally. For example,"" Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusal shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" (paragraph 2). Another insistance was when NASA shared the image of the Face and the author who wrote the caption clearly explained how the landform looked like a face. ""huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""(paragraph 3).

As you can see people who belive in conspiracy theories, often do not have the evidence to back up that theory. The reason for these theories often come from movies and tv shows. ""The ""Face of Mars"" has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magizines, radio talk show- even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars- evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" (paragraph 5).

73A6B519C155,"There is minimal evidence to prove that the Face was actually created by aliens. However, there is evidence to back up the claim that the Face is just a natural landform. Landforms such as this exist on Earth and high-quality images have been taken showing a normal landform on the surface of Mars.

One reason we know the Face was not created by aliens is because of it's similarities to landforms on earth. The Face is ""the Martian equivalent"" of landforms common to the American West called mesas. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, commented on the similarities. ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho...That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."" The fact that the Face resembles a natural landform here on Earth supports the idea of the Face also being a natural landform.

Not only does the Face have similarities to natural landforms on Earth, higher quality pictures of it have been taken since 1976. In 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia where the Face was located. Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team ""snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original image"". The photo was uploaded to a JPL web site where thousands were waiting for a picture. A natural landform was revealed. ""There was no alien monument after all"".

Some people, however, were not convinced. ""Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by a haze."" People believed the clouds had blocked the view of ""alien markings"". In 2001, on a ""cloudless summer day"". Mars Global Surveyor got another look. The photo was taken in maxium resolution. ""Each pixels in the 2001 images spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo.""

Earth similarities and high-quality images can support the claim that the Face was not created by aliens. The Face is simply a natural landform, not an alien creation. ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Many conspiracy theorists say that this is something thaat nasa should not have put out for all to see. they say that in the picture that was sent out was too foggy and that it was hiding things in the fog.

When this face first appeared on there monitors, they were surprised, but allitle bit after that they decided that it was just another mesa, which was common in the place that they found it at, which would be in Cydonia. they said that it just had unusual shadows that gave it the looks of a persons face.

They knew that it was just a martian mese, so they decided to let everyone else see this amazng picture, hoping that they could gather the attention of the public. it did do that which was great but then they wanted to know more. so then when NASA launched another mission for mars they decided to take another picture of the face, which this time it was alot clearer for the people to see that it was just another martian mesa.

People still weren't happy with those pictures, the people didn't know how hard it is to get it in the right place for another picture, but NASA was willing to get another picture for the people to finally prove that it wasn't an alien artifact. they took the picture with the camera's maximum resolution, so that the people could see everything in the picture clearly. although some people might not be satisfied, many people are.

C1E2C9CD9E57,"The Face showing on Mars has been proved to be a natural landform. The Face is a landform because landforms are very common in Cydonia, the only reason the landform looked like a face was because of the shadows visible from the camera, and there was no other evidence found around the face. Also all research for the Face was done by authorized NASA scientists, and the research was believed to be done very carefully.

In Cydonia it is common to have natural landforms, so the Face was easy to be spotted as one. And as the cameras took pictures from different angles, the scientists could see it wasn't anything that spectacular. What made the Face so intresting and made people have false accusations was what made the Face an actual ""face"".

The reason that this lanform resembled a face was because of the shadows. There was shadows on the landform that resembled a head, eyes, a nose, and a mouth. Scientists even stated that the Face ""looked like an Egyptian Pharoah"".

Even if the Face was found to look like something that was a living thing does not have an effect on the research that had been completed on this landform.

To make this statement that the Face is in fact a landform is the amounts of research done by NASA scientists. From snapping numerous pictures to keep resuming to study the Face, NASA has had many ways to prove their point. And after placing the first image on a JPL website, it was settled for most people- the once known as ""Face"" was a natural landform. It was no sign of Aliens or an Alien monument anywhere to be seen on Mars.

And the last statement to be concluded about this discussion is that there was nothing else found near the Face to thinking there is any living activity on Mars. NASA has also concluded from the pictures that there had been no objects in the picture like ""airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks..."" So there had been no activity to prove to be nothing more from just a landform.

In the picture of the Face, it was also evidenced to resemble a mesa or a butte, another kind of natural landform. These kinds of natural landforms were even almost the same height as the Face on Mars. And all of this evidence proved that what used to be thought of as a real face is now catagorized as a natural landform with some shadows that gives it unique look.

0776BF8605AD,"In 1976 something weird was discovered on Mars. Viking 1 spacecraft snapped a picture of something that almost looks like a face on Mars. It could be the sign we need to find out if there is life on Mars. A lot of people are saying it is a face, while others do think it is just a natural landform. There have also been pictures captured from 1998 and 2001. This face has became a pop icon, it has appeared in Hollywood films, magazines, books, and even radio talk shows! Although there has been quite a few reasons to think it is a face I personally think it's just a natural landform. Now yes, I do have many reasons for my thinking. In these next couple paragraphs I will state my reasons.

One of my firsts reasons for thiking it is a natural landform is that there are many landforms naturally made just like that around Earth. So if they are natural landforms on Earth they would probably be natural landforms on the planet Mars. In the article Garvin says, "" it reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

My second reason would be that it sorda resembles a face but not really. Theres a very high chance that could just be a mountain and the shadows resemble the eyes, nose, and mouth. As you can see in the picture from 2001 it almost doesnt even look like a face. It is more like a mountain of some sorts there. If you do look at the 1976 photo from distance it does resemble a face, but as the camera quality improved over time it does not look as much like a face anymore.

Another reason is that it is very very unlikely that bthere is an imprint of a face on the planet of Mars. Even if it was though it would basicaly always look the same and not change looks like it has. Now a natural landform will change looks over time. It will rott or decompose and stuff. Which in my opinion it has decayed somewhat. It definintaly has not stayed the same, because all 3 pictures have a significant difference to them. That could be rom better camera and technology quality. To me though it seems as if the better quality makes it look less like a face.

Now though I have a few more reasons this will be my final reason. This ""Face of Mars"" is the some of the only proof we have to think that there is life on Mars. So it makes me more and more right. It is just very unlikely or maybe even impossible for that to be a face. It is not unlikely that it is a natural landform though.

I do realize there are many reasons why I am wrong and why it is a face but I think it is a natural landform. So in conclusion It is more likely for this , Face of Mars, to be a natural lanforn than for it to be a face.                ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

The day that the picture of the ""face"" was taken it was cloudy and may have crated the shadows, or there are rocks that are higher up that created the shadows.

It is stated in the article that the ""face"" does not actually have eyes or a nose, that it was just the shadows that made them. scientists proved that it was not a face by takeing another more clear image of the ""face"", showing that it was a land formation and not an alien. They also proved that there were no alien pyramids, shacks, or any alien artifacts near the rock formation.

In 2001, the quality of the pixels were clear enough to show that the ""face"" was only a lanform. In the picture of 1976, it is visible that the picture is blurry. In the picture of 1998, the picture is less blurry, but still hard to see. In the 2001 picturer, the picture is very visible and well seen. At the bottom of the mesa, it is also visible to see the lanform has a rounded, smooth, almost non man-made surface that buried the landform into the planet side.

Next, the Internet, showed what the scientists and the picters showed. A landform.

In the text, it states that when the picture was taken in 1998, it was the cloudy time of theyear on the red planet.

~ The NASA wishes that there wree civilization on Mars. Why is that? The NASA is trying to prove that the aliens put them unfilmualr faces onto Mars. When Mars jsut had them faces grew onto there. The faces were not put there for the aliens.

~ The scientists also believed that the face that is on Mars arrived on Mars in September 1997. That was eighteen years ago when the Vikings missions ended. Jim Garvin also said they took a picture of it when they first heard about the faces arriving on Mars. The NASA program felt it was very important that they get a good picture of the faces on Mars.

Thats how i can prove to you that the face was not created by aliens.

The original picture- the one looking like a face- was taken on a poor quility camera. It was taken on the viking 1, according to the article, in 1976. The camera equipment was out of date, making that picture irrelivent. Also, one pixel on the camera spanned 43 meters, according to the reading. Thats one reason that the picture looked like a face.

Another way we are sure that is wasnt alien-made, is ouur newer photo-evidence. As stated in the previous paragraph, the one pixel on the viking 1 spanned 43 meters. Our newest photo was shot with a camera having pixels spanning 1.56 metes. That's a big difference! Our new camera is up to date, and proves that it is nothing but a natural land form. Lastly, according to the reading, we captured a picture of the face at the maximum quality. This proves to show that the old picture was just an illusion, because of the low quality.

The last reason that we can be sure that th face was nothing but a landformation, is the fact that if it was made by aliens- we wouldnt be keeping it a secret. If anything, it would be benificial towards NASA if we found aliens. It would gives us a beter reputation and more money to fund our projects. If there WAS an alien civilization on mars, we would share it with the public, not hide it. That how we know that it was nothing but a landform.

These are all reasons that we can use to prove to you that the face was nothing more than a natural landform. The original photo was taken in 1976, with an outdated camera. We took a new picture of higher quility, of the same spot, and there was not face. Even there were aliens, it would be benificial toward NASA to share it with the public.

951BF63BC21A,"The landform on Mars is quite interesting, and there could be many thoughts on how it came to be. With already known knowledge and knowledge that is soon to come, people like to guess. With the already known knowledge, we know so far that aliens have not been found on Mars yet, therefore they couldn't have possibly made a mark.

Like Earth, Mars is a planet just with different features. Our earth forms mountains and hills due to erosion and our plate tectonics. It's naturaly formed by the planet. No living organism created the rocky mountains. So with that, it is able to be assumed that Mars can form it's own hills and mountains as well.

Something else that is credible is that no life form has been found on Mars yet. Who knows if Mars has erosion or layers under it's surface that is able to move? On

Mars, there is no life that could have possibly created such a piece of art. Earth itself makes beautiful art like the Grand Canyon and

Niagra Falls. Naturaly, these landforms formed by Earth. Nobody knows exactly if Mars is able to do that, but with the relyablility we have today it has not proven that any life form could have created the Face on Mars.

If these markings were to be made by some kind of living organism, we almost certainly would know about it. Especialy with all of the high technology we have today, we would be able to see any kind of life. Maybe if we explored undernethe the surface of Mars, then we could get more information to see if Mars could have created it or if these aliens are living undernethe.

It's a great way to assume how it happened by comparing Mars to Earth, but it could also be irrelevent. Earth, unlike Mars, has an atmosphere. It keeps in heat, but changes. Earth also has water and life. If this were to be a cause of the rocks, hills, and mountains, then it could be said that the face on Mars was not created by erosion, water, or anything like that. It takes a lot of studing and even more knowledge to figure it out, but aliens don't seem to be logical quite yet.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
710A2280E20F,"It is logically impossible for aliens to create what we call The Face. Although we do not know if such life forms exist, it still could not happen. It would take hundreds, or even thousands of lightyears to travel to the Milkyway galaxy. Extra-terrestrials would most likely have the same life-span as us, or slighty shorter/longer. So they probably couldn't survive the whole trip to our galaxy.

Even though no one knows how The Face was made, there are some more possible explanations. Strong winds could have eroded the surface of Mars and carried its contents to another location miles away from where they originally were.

Some lighter winds could have made indents on the flat part, giving it ""facial features.""

We have no evidence that truly proves that aliens are real. Many pictures that people show of their ""encounter"" just for attention. Others are just hoaxes. On the other hand, we were not there with those people to know that it wasn't true. Yet the lack of evidence says that they don't exist.

How would aliens even know what a human face looks like? They probably would have no idea (if they existed, that is). In the passage it says that The Face resembles an Egyptian pharoh. I don't think that aliens could understand what that was and leave an imprint on Mars that resembles a pharoh.

What kind of technology would they be using? A large laser? Technology/weapons that advanced don't exist yet, so it could not happen. It would most likely take a very long time since it is nearly two miles long. To be honest, I don't think anyone would have the patience to do that. Not even aliens.

5D5B9C621FF4,"I love us humans, and our little species-wide neural shortcuts. One example of a ""shortcut"" is face recognitioon. Our brains tell us what is human by looking at the face. The brain does have some flaws in this, though, because we tend to see faces where there isn't one. One of the most notable examples is the face on Mars. There is no way the ""face"" on the red planet was made by aliens, because as previously stated, the brain sees faces where there aren't any, the ""face"" is a common occurane on Mars, a mesa, and any alien proof would be seen in recent pictures. All of the evidence points towards the obvious conclusion, and the most likely scenario is probably correct, as Occam's Razor points out.

To begin, the brain tries to recognize faces, and it is really good at it. It says, ""Yep, that's a face!"" and that's because humans are social creatures. We need to recognize others that will be able to support us and stay together, because in ancient times, that, along with our ability to think and reason, was what we had going for us. As one source that I forget the name of stated, ""Pretty much the only thing we can outsprint by bodylengths per second is vegetables."" We could make tools and weapons to support ourselves, but to be effective, we had to team up. And that is why we see a ""man in the moon"". We see the face by craters. This is just the same thing, our brains being awesome at seeing faces, but not at recognizing the lack of a body to go with them.

Also, the ""face"" is a common occurance on Mars, a mesa. It is just a landform. This is shown by the NASA saying ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa - landforms common around the American West."" The ""face"" is just a landform. The most recent picture shows the mesa in much more detail, and the face starts to fade away as the resolution increases.

As stated before, the picture resolution increases with each attempt at an image, and still no alien civilization! The article states ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" If there was above-ground alien civilization, we would have seen it by these pictures. The logical conclusion for the illogical is ""What if they are underground?"" and this is a valid point until you look at it more closely. To ""sculpt"" this landform, the aliens would have to dig out surrounding land, and that is hard, not impossible, but hard to do. And as stated before, use Occam's Razor. Also, they would most likely have to have some way to see humans, because the chances of aliens on a different planet in a different environment evolving similar faces to ours seems a little far-fetched. They would have some sort of visible, surface-bound satillite dish or something similar to recieve the signal.

Some might argue, ""Well, NASA is just covering up life on Mars."" and to that arguement, I say ""Good job! You are so close to logic!"" because while NASA could cover up the truth, they wouldn't do so. It would be good for business to discover some ""sentient alien life"" because the NASA budget would skyrocket! Everyone would want to know ""What they look like? Do they have a language?"" et cetera. Also, if they wanted to cover it up, no matter how much it would improve NASA, they have to release images publicly. If they managed to do some fancy photoshopping and release the images, there are people skilled enough to undo those photoshops and also, photoshopping leaves some computer traces around on an image, and there are plenty of free online sites that will spot those traces and show anyone where and how those touch-ups were made.

The most obvious conclusion is probably the right one, and all evidence points towards just a natural landform. The brain's ability to detect faces, the frequency of those landforms, and the ability to see alien civilization, if any exists, in more recent pictures proves the point of those who follow logic though the tinfoil-hat warriors try to say otherwise.

and after starring at the picture for 36 minutes he says ''ALIENS MADE IT'' and i said no well we dont know wat it was i believe it was just a natural landform he says no it was aliens so i say lets take another picture,so my team and i used our viking 1s absolute maximum resolution camra and so snaped 1 more photo of the face and sent it to our scientest and 2 weeks pass and the scientest say its an natrual landform coused by a lava dome that bursted and caused the rockes to form a human like face and there was no alien like monument anywhere",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
CAE891339BE2,"Twenty five years ago , NASA'S Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planet.

There was a face on mars but it wasnt really a face it was a mesa. But to me it kind of looked like a face popping out oof the mars planet. But it is kind of wierd that someone pictured a face on the earths planet like that. I think it became popular.

Some scientists believed it was an alien articraft, but it probably was but i think it wasnt. I just think it was a rock shaped like a face to me. The face of mars is located at 41 degrees norht martian latitude. If i was in space i wish i would be the first one to discover that face because i could probaby get famous or get a lot of money. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face. Perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze.

What the picture really shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. But thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site. There was no alien after all. But a few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see.

But the caption noted a huge rock. No face at all.

The Face on Mars has become a pop icon. So it is popular. It starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years. That is amazing this face on mars has a become very famous and very known. Some people think the face is bona fide evidence of life on mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide.

3C44018480D7,"The face you think was created by aliens was not, because we have no evidence of aliens throught all of our travels in space. The face is just a natural landform on Mars. If you think that NASA wants to hide this for their research your wrong. If NASA released that there was alien lifeforms on Mars their funding would be increased by a lot. The photos may look likes the face was created by something, but it is a naturally formed mesa. It looks like a face because the shadows form what look to be like eyes, a nose, and a mouth. If there have been spacecrafts surveying the land on Mars then why have there not been any pictures sent back of alien lifeform.

If the face was created by aliens where, the aliens should be nearby unless they can travel faster than anything the Earth has. The face could not have been created by aliens because there is not any lifeform on Mars that is not microscopic. We havesurveyed Mars several times and not seen anything proving alien liforns except for this face. If there are aliens then there should be more evidence than a face, which is most likely a mesa. If there are aliens and they built this face, it had to mean something to them. If the face meant something to the aliens then they would be found near it. The Middle Butte in the Snake RIver Plain of Idaho is a lave dome that takes the place of an isolated mesa and is about the same height as the face on Mars.

In 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came close enough to the face to get a good picture. It was a cloudless day, so the picture was very clear. Each pixel measured to about 1.56 meters. The Viking 1 photo measured about 43 meters per pixel. There were no markings on the face from an alien lifeform.

The Mars Global Surveyor looks straight down on the planet taking pictures and sending them to NASA. Since the Mars Global Surveyor only does 2.5 km-wide strips it does not pass over the face very often. Even though it does not pass over the face very often the Mars Global Surveyor covers a lot of land and has not seen any aliens. You have the right to still believe that the face as created by alien lifeform, but I hope these facts changed your point of view on the situation.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Landforms like the Face are found very commonly, but not all landforms found are exactly like the Face. In the next paragraph I will give you some reasons why the Face wasn't formed by aliens.

The Face found on Mars was just a natural landform. In the passage it says, when Michael Malin took pictures 10 times sharper, with his Mars Orbiter Camera, the image revealed just a natural landform. If you take a look in paragraph 2 it states that mesa, or landforms, are commonly found around Mars. Also, the Face has equivalence to landforms found around the American West.

B3DCC9D9797B,"Have you ever heard about big faces on Mars, NASA has gone on many space trips but this time they found sothing creepy. They had found big faces made in the dust, NASA said they have never heard about anything like this before So that makes me a little scared on how they got there.

I think that it is scary having planets have faces on them. these Faces were found in 1976 and it was hard to see and in 1998 and in 2001 the face got covered by sand and dust and you couldnt see it anymore. in 1976 there was a group called the Viking 1 sent by NASA. They had found a 2nd face made and it had shadows in its eyes, and mouth.

There was a big time when everyone kept talking about these faces in magazines, in social media, and in abandoned stores. ""The Face on Mars has since become a pop icon. It has starred in holltwood films, appered in books, magazines, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery stores.""(5)

Some people say that these faces are awesome and that NASA should go on the planet Mars and explore the faces on Mars. This finding was very important to tax payers. NASA had taken many pictures of these faces they even sent another space ship to go with a better camera to take better pictures."" we felt this was important to taxpayers"", explained Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NAS's Mars exploration program."" we photographed the Face as soon as we could get a good shot at it."" (6)

NASA had sent a 3rd space mission in April 5, 1998 when the space ship had passed over Cydonia the took a picture of the face. It is very hard to find this face because it was under a cloud on Mars. When the space ship took a picture there wasnt anything at all because they were in the wrong are of the planet. When the space ship got to the right place it was hidden but it was in the same place. People think that aliens had put a Haze over the face so the peoploe couldnt see it anymore. ""The camera on board MGs had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. perhaps, said skeptics, Alien markings were hidden by haze.(8)

No one has ever seen these Faces again so maybe they were hidden by some or somthing. Hopefully soon NASA will send another space trip to try to find these Faces again. It proves that a lot of people were scared at first but then they werent because the space mission couldnt find them then they did and everyone was excited. Personally i would be scared knowing that somthing had made those then hid them with Haze and clouds.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
5E5E3A3AFDD3,"Unmasking the Face on Mars has always been an argumentive topic for us scientists and the conspiracy theorists. Is it just a naturally forming landform? Was it created by aliens? No one knows for sure but from our research, it is very unlikely that aliens could have assembled it.

Us scientists here at NASA take our jobs very seriously. We research the outside world for a living and theorists are just taking guesses! Would you rather believe a NASA scientist or a conspiracy theorist's hypothesis of space? As humans, we always choose the craziest scenarios and we assume the worst. It could be something as simple as a landform for all we know.

There is no proof of aliens but there is proof of landforms forming naturally. Yes, the ""face"" looks like it was made to look that way and yes it is oddly accurate to the face of an egyptian pharoh but this could just be a coincidence. We have very high tech cameras that shoot pictures of mars all the time. The ""best"" picture of the face from 1796 was taken by a camera with 43 meters per pixel. In 2001, we used a camera with 1.56 meters in each pixel so if there were so called ""aliens"" that assembled the face, they would have been captured in the shot as well. As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size.

What the picture shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms common around the American West. People sometimes say it reminds them most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. Another thing that makes the idea of it being a landform likely is that Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho is a lava dome that takes form of an isolated mesa which is about the same height as the Face on Mars so they are both very similar to eachother.

There are a lot of ideas about what the Face could be. We will continue research and further our studies. Until then, believe as you wish but remember, scientists or theorists?       ",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
E2126994422B,"Alien comics are the real deal?

The average conspiracy theorist might think the picture of the ""Face"" was created by aliens but science and reasearch shows otherwise. Many people connect space with aliens but it's all really fiction. Everyone wants to believe that those comics and fairytales they used to read when they were younger are actually real. So any piece of information from mars that could be the slightest bit connected to earth makes everyone go bananas! Here is why your ideas and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas Are way off.

First, How are you putting out their ideas and beliefs but we have yet to see you guys give any evidence whats so ever. See, The team at NASA has actually done research and it's our job. When we went out to the sight where the ""Face"" is located Us and other scientists figure it was just another Martian mesa, Also, these are common around cydonia, Only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh.

Next, If this accusation was in deed Truthful why in the world would we hide this from anyone!? It would honestly help us and make us even more financially stable.

Even when we revealed the picture it engaged many common citizens and it attracted attention to mars. So, even if the whole alien thing was true it would really benfit the people. Not only are they going to learn about possibly Alive aliens but they get to learn even more about mars and how they function in space.

Also, We've provided all the evidence that we possibly can. We even went back out to The sight and took pictures again to prove these you and the rest of the conspiracy thoerists wrong. When we went back out to the sight we used a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!

Now you and many might say ""Well i still don't think their telling the truth, their probably hiding something because it might discredit them and their business.""

Well, NASA and the rest of the scientist have done all we can. Our job is to explore space and find new things that might help us on earth. So, after all the reseach we've done. Plus all the trips we've made back out there to provide the community with evidence and pictures and you guys still don't believe us thats your problem. When conspiracy theorist provide us with 100 percent credible and sufficent information then we can look into it more but for now you guyses Arguement is full of opinions.

In conclusion, This is how you and the rest of the conspiracy theorist ideas are very false and irrelevant. NASA has been in business for awhile now and we like to be looked at as very honest, diligent and hardworking people. We do not at all appreciate you and you team degrading us. We spend thousands and thousands of dollars each mission just so we can have evidence and Information that is accurate. We take our jobs very seriously. After speaking with you today i hope you can rethink your ideas and your beliefs because we've done everything we could to provide you and the rest of the people with good sources to support our decision and our arguement.

The photos you have seen was a hill developing in the process over time. We have taken a photo of the strange spot on the planet Mars and it has been reported,that it is a natural landform.

We did not have the same technology as what we have had in the past. When we first took the picture we did not have the same technology so we had a blurry picture. But when we have our technology now, we have better cameras so that we can get a better image of the big red planet called Mars. We have no proof that aliens have built this face in the surface on mars. This face you see on the planet is just a landform.

The face you might see in the photograph is just a mind illusion that you might see a face. the face you see is a hill that has been formed by the ways of the planet its self. It might have been molding from the dust and the wind dragging the red sand and dirt off of the hill its self.

We have no way or knowledge to know that aliens have built this face on the hill. The face has been forming for probably thousands and thousands of years. We think the forming on mars, like craters and hole in the ground, plus the face is just a natural landform forming on the crust of mars its self.

This scenario occured on May 24, 2001 when there was a strange dent on Mars. This event was advertized in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio talk shows, and haunted grocery store checkout lines for twenty-five years. Why did the news about this event linger around for this long?

When the dent in Mars was spotted, NASA investigated to determine what could have created such a mark. In paragraph three, it states that the mark resembled a human face that contained the following features, eyes, nose, and a mouth. It also states that the authors of NASA discussed that this finding would be a great way to lure the public into wanting to know more about Mars. If NASA could get the public interested enough, then the station would recieve an abundant amout of attention. This could make the station wealthy so that their budget would thrive and they could avoid any financial issues.

NASA gathered information by capturing photos of the face-like inprint on Mars. In paragraph seven, the article states that on April 5, 1998 the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, and their team captured a picture ten times more accurate photo than the Vikings. Keep in mind that the sharp photos were taken in 1998; and that the Viking photo from 2001, in the top section of the article, is less detailed than the one taken in 1998. Technology, such as cameras, continues to improve the quality of pictures, not decrease the quality.

NASA not only does their research based on facts and history, but they also base it off of land forms. In paragraph twelve, it states that the picture taken actually shows a landfrom that is common around the American West. If NASA stopped drawing the public in by giving this information, then others would lose interest and NASA would then struggle to thrive and suceed. They could loose money, supporters, and others who make their station function. Why would a company want to put themselves in danger, especially NASA where many bright individuals that can help the future?

The article provides statements and facts in paragragh three, five, seven, and twelve to abolish the theory that there was ever a dent in Mars that could be an aliens face. Also, provided for you at the top of this article you can examine the photos that have been taken.

3003599AC8B7,"The ""Face of Mars"" was a huge discovery for the scientists at NASA. Not because of the discovery of Cydonia's face, but rather the attention and funding NASA recieved due to peoples' anticipation of aliens on Mars. The face has been confirmed, by NASA, to not be an alien structure; however, conspiracy theorists and people in denial think what NASA says is a lie.

It is a fact that the Face of Cydonia is only a unique natural landmass (Paragraph 1) The search for the truth of Cydonia started in 1976 when NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling Mars and was snapping pictures for where its sister ship, Viking 2, could land. the Face of Cydonia was spotted when the Viking 1 circled the region of Cydonia. The face resembled a shadowy likeness of a human face. (Paragraph 2) After the image was surveyed by the mission controllers in the Jet Propulsion Lab, there was an assumed uproar of excitement; however, after all the excitement, Scientists figured it out. It was another Martian Mesa that had a unique resemblense of an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh.

With all this information, people should've been convinced but some still weren't. Scientists over at NASA have come out with the original 1976 image of Cydonia's face. Later on more information had come out and on April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia and snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original and it gave even more evidence of the face being a butte. People who weren't convinced, or conspiracy theorists, still believe the Face of Cydonia is pure evedience of Aliens even after the second picture.

The Face of Cydonia, factually, is a landmass. For all you people who still don't believe that, you have all the evidence to counter your claims. For example, in paragraph (5), it states that some people like you believe the face of Mars is ""Bona fide"" evidence of life. you believe that the U.S Government, with NASA, would rather hide any evidence to support the claim of aliens. to counter your claims, NASA used your tax dollars by funding a third expedition to Cydonia. In paragraph (10), it states that on April 8, 2001, NASA took the Mars Global Surveyor close enough for a second look. They found Cydonia's Face and snapped a picture ten times better, in resoulution, than the last one and they gathered even more evidence supporting their claim. Lastly, you conspiracy theorists say NASA is hiding eveidence, yet they gave everyone the images from 1976, 1998, and 2001, with the dates they were taken; even with, the resoulution, camera name, and the pixel size.

In conclusion, all of you conspiracy theorists' counter-arguements have no evidence to back them up; however, NASA has all the evidence of the Face of Cydonia, being a Martian landmass. NASA also has given everyone the eveidence they even gathered. The Face of Cydonia was an exciting discovery, but people who were too excited, were angry with the truth; as a result, conspiracy theorists and defenders of the NASA budget came out in an uproar of denial.

25 years ago NASA says they found the face on Mars. While they were circleing mars with their space drone. It was a short lived suprised because it looked like a natual structure that formed over time. Then a couple days later NASA let the whole world see, if NASA even had the littlest idea that aliens then they would not have released it to the public. The face has become a pop icon that everyone likes. Some thimk that this is pure evidence of life on Mars but NASA's budget defenders wish there was because if there was life on mars then they would get tons of money from the discovery of extraterestrial beings on mars. Overall the face is decaying over the years if there was aliens then don't you think they would fix it at least maybe once or twice over the many years that ""their creation"" that proves that ali nes didnt make it. You can also compare it to narurally made landforms that are common around the western part of America. So if there were thnings that were made but non natural then they would be able t o see all the falts andpices you can tell that were not naturally made,because of how good the graphics are on the space drones phtos that are tooken in such great quality that you can see all the pixles. This creation really stood out to NASA because they can only see in 2.5km strips amd is mostly made out of Mars dust that surrounds Mars,they had to peer through the wispy clouds just to see it because of how cloudy it is on that side of the planet.

First, This natrual landform was not form by alein becuase in the pictures you see a small mountain or big hill , but here in the USA, there are many of thoes big hills or small mountains. They are mostly around the American west. It is a lava dome that are on the USA too. and they are the same height. So that face on that hill is not alone.

Next, Another reason on how that natrual landform is natural not made by aliens is that every time we take a picture over the years the face is always fadeding away so if an alien created it why would he just leave it there just to faded away.

They would of kept it alive.

Last, I can see on how somebody could think this was formed by an alien but how do you explain that the eyes are just shadows. They are formed from the nearby rock. Plus the mouth and nose are also formed by the nearby rock shadow. So the mouth, nose and eyes are not really even there they are just shadows

In conclusion, I am telling the alien face that was on mars was just a lava dome. And its eyes nose mouth were just shadows. Plus the picture just started fading away through the years. This is how the Face was not made by aleins but was a natural landform ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

Aliens not been proven to be living in the universe with a secret ancient civilization. Though some people might believe this is untrue, NASA has yet to find evidence to support it. If scientists knew Cydonia was created by aliens, they would definetly want to investigate this further.

This is why I believe that the ""Face on Mars"" is a natural landform. There are many other reasons why I think this, but the ones that I have stated are more likely to be understaning to one another. ",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
3FDC2CD9FB9F,"The face on mars is not caused by aliens, that is upcerd. Aliens wouldnt make a face on mars because their is no such thing of them doing so. The face you see on mars is just a detailed rock formation that formed by natural causes, and also the eyes, mouth, and nose are just shadows caused by the formation.

Aliens would'nt accure on mars to make a mark, if they were real they would be much farther then mars. This landform has been their for over 18 years so the odds are not aliens but erosion on the planet mars. Back then itwasnt seeable but now it is due to these erosions. If their were alians that made the formation People would've already be talking about the alien sightings.

This is why the formation was not made by aliens. Also any aircrafts, small shacks, or airplains would be able to be seen in the picture due to the pixels in the camera. The camera would be able to see anything that goes on mars. All of the details that you see is just shadows from the rock That makes it look like it has eyes, a mouth, and a nose, and thats why the face is a natural land form and not made by alens.",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
6A231491AAF7,"The reason I, the scientist think and know that the face is just a natural landform is because, we have pictures of Mars and the ""face"" picture.

The first reason why my claim is true is because firstly, there is NO proof of life being on Mars of all the years it has existed and there could possibly be no life on that planet because there is NO way that there could be life on Mars, because of its condition. Mars is NOT fit for humans to live on or any other natural organism. I'm not just saying a that a human could live on the planet but, you wouldn't even last 5 seconds on Mars. In fact, Mars has volcanoes. Maybe its just a lava dome? Who knows? But what we do know is that there could possibly be no sign of any human or other organisms on planet Mars. On April 5, 1998, when the Mars Global Surveryor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Oribiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a pictures ten times sharper than the original Viking photo. And justin that picture, there was no proof of any supernatural life (alien) life or human monument on Mars.       ",2,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
5A4B52D6101D,"Many believe that the ""Face On Mars"" was created by aliens. I believe it is just a natural landform. People believe that is was created by aliens because it ""resembles a human head . . . formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.""

I still don't believe aliens was the cause of this unique landform.

First off, I don't believe in aliens and second, even if they do or did exist how could they create such a creative landform?

If aliens do exist, how would they know what a human looks like? I believe it is just an illusion.

Many weird, unique, creative landforms are found around Earth that weren't human made, so just because there is a unique landform on Mars we believe aliens formed the landfrom? I believe scientists and other people this to start rumors or just want everyone to believe people say this to get a rise out of every one else. Also, I think they just want it to be big news, ""Aliens are real and we have evidence!"" or something that will get a rise out of everyone.

""Michael Malin and his Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times better than the original Vikings photos. ""Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing . . . a natural landfrom. ""There was no alien monument after all.""

That is some evidence that aliens didn't create this landform and that it is just a natural, very unique and creative, landform. Natural landforms are everywhere, even different planets. There are many natural landforms on the moon, but no one says there is aliens living on the moon.

So, I hope this explains to you that aliens did NOT create this landform, it is a natural landform.

The only difference is is that it is on a different planet instead of Earth. I believe that's why everyone thinks aliens created it. Like I said before, natural landforms are everywhere, they're natural so of course they'll be everywhere. So, don't let some person with no evidence tell you there are aliens on Mars and they it for a fact because someone else said it was true. If you ever want to be a scientist, you need to find your own evidence or make sure whoever you got the evidence from is correct. Also, you NEED to be skeptical.

DAAF78326970,"Twenty-five years ago the JPL took the first photograph of the Face on Mars. The face on Mars is actually a naturally occuring land formation. Several photographs of the face have been taken over the last 27 years. The photographs were all taken by Nasa's Jet Propulsion Labratory (JPL).

The face on Mars was not created by aliens. Although it may look that way, the face is actually the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa. The same landforms are common around the American West. In Cydonia, the area where the photographs were taken, butte's and mesa's are common. The Martian mesa has wierd shadowing on the top which, caused it to look like a face. If the Face on Mars was created by aliens it would be easy to tell, because ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters.""The refore making the image incredibly clear and making it easier for analyst to identify what the face actually is.

Even if it was created by aien lifeforms hundreds of years ago, Nasa would not keep this a secret from the world. Because it would benefit them. And also if it was created by alien lifeforms and Nasa wanted to keep it a secret, why would they release the image in the first place.

If you think that the face is an evidence that theres life on Mars, then think about how they got there and how advance their technology would have to be. The face is just a natural landform because on paragraph 12 it says, ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa-landforms common around the American West""(Unmasking of the Face on Mars,12).

You may think that it is evidence that life exist on Mars. I respect that. You got some good evidence, some scienctists even believe that too. That the face is an alien artifact. ""Althought few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact""(Unmasking of the Face on Mars,6). I'm not gonna lie, it does look like a face to me too.

Althought it may look like a face, alien artifact , or the face of an Egyptian Pharaoh. You still have to get cold hard facts. Some facts like, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh""(Unmasking of the Face on Mars,2).It was even unveiled as "" Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose , and mouth""(Unmasking of the Face on Mars,3).

0BE8D5466137,"In 1976 NASA's Viking 1 took a photo of a landform that resembled a face. This excited the public. NASA has gone back to that place twice and taken higer defenition photos to make sure that it is not a face or some monument made by aliens. They have fond that it is a common landform, a mesa or butte. If it were more, NASA would tell the public right away. News of life on Mars would excite the public, and provide NASA with funding for future explorations.

The first photo of the landform was taken in 1976 by Viking 1. Each pixel in the photo represents 43 meaters. It is difficult to see deitalies in this photo. NASA believed that it was thier duty to make sure this was not a sign of extraterestrial life. In 1998, Mars Orbiter Camera took a picture ten times sharper than the original. This picture showed more deatail, but the public was not satisfied. In 2001 NASA took another photo of the spot. In this photo a pixel is equal to 1.56 meters. This image is so sharp that if anything unusual were there, you could see it.

Mesas are a common landform in that area. Cydonia, where the Face is located has lots of other landforms like mesas and buttes. Simaler landforms are also found on earth. Landforms come in all different shapes and sizes, and this one happens to resemble a face. That is not unusual, we like to find thing that look like other things. For example you might see a cloud and say it looks like a bunny. Likewise we see a landform and say it resembles a face.

The Face, ""a huge rock formation...resembles a human head"", but this is pure coincedence. the shape of the formation forms shadows giving the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth. NASA has taken very detailed photographs to make sure there is not alien life. The Face on Mars is a mesa or butte, a common formation. If there was life on Mars NASA wouldn't hide it, it would excite people about space and provide money for future explorations.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
DC59B3A9D4A2,"Ther are 3 main supportive reassons why this ""face on mars"" is just a natral landform. One, there is a posibility that the face is just a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth""-paragraph 3. Two, if the face on mars was evidence of life on mars that would be ''evedence that NASA would rather hide""-paragraph 5. Three, paragraph 12 explains that the face on mars is equivalent to a butte or mesa.

First of all there is a posibility that the face is just a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth""-paragraph 3. I believe this beacuse NASA does not come across it veary often. Therefore, every time NASA did see the face then they might of just cought the rock formation at the right time, therefore cetching the right light. In a better picture taken in 1976 by Viking 1 you can clearly see shadows wich might be the scource of the face formation.

Second if the face on mars was evidence of life on mars that would be ''evedence that NASA would rather hide""-paragraph 5. I think this very much makes sence because if it were evidence that would be somthing surely to keep out of the media. If there were other evidence of life on mars then why would NASA let just one piece of evidence out if it could easaly be mistaken. Then you would have a fake story going around that could possibly spark tension between countries for lieing about life on mars.

Third, paragraph 12 explains that the face on mars is equivalent to a butte or mesa. A butte is a lava bome that takes the form of an isolated mesa. Therefore creating a figure that, with the right light, will creat a face loking feature. Also since a better picture was taken it would be easeier to ""discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size"". ""So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""-paragraph 11

""The Face on Mars"" is a ""huge rock formation...which resembles a human head,"" as NASA stated in 1976.

Many know that it is just a natural landform like on earth, but some believe that the Face was created by aliens.

The Face is nothing more than a natural landform because we have landforms like it here on earth, photographic evidence reveals a natural landform, and there is no evidence that the Face was built by life outside of earth.

The Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform, just like we have on earth.

Jim Garvin, who is the chief scientist of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, knows that the Face is just another landform.

""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" he said, ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.""

This is just one piece of evidence that the Face cannot be anything more than a natural landform--because it has many characteristics of a landform here on earth.

A second reason that the Face on Mars is nothing more than a natural landform is because of the images taken in 2001 by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS).

Twenty five years after its first photographs, clearer, higher resolution photos of Face came from MGS.

From the 43 meters per pixel in the 1976 photograph versus the 1.56 meters per pixel in the 2001 photograph, there is clearly enough evidence that the Face on Mars is just a natural land formation similar to a mesa.

The rises and dips in the landform just resemble the shape of eyes, nose, and mouth of a human face and nothing more, but after seen more clearly, cracks and crevaces in the land prove that the Face is just a natural landform.

Those who believe that the Face on Mars was built by aliens have nothing to base their beliefs on other than the fact that the landform resembles a face.

No evidence whatsoever suggests that the Face was built by supernatural life.

On the other hand, photos--and common sense itself--prove that the landform is just another landform like we have on earth.

The passage itself proves the authenticity of the landform.

It says that ""thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing...a natural landform.

There was no alien monument at all,"" proving that the Face is only a landform.

To conclude, no evidence suggests that the Face on Mars is anything more than a natural landform.

The Face has characteristics of a landform on earth, and images of it from 2001 reveal only a landform.

On top of that, those who believe that alien activity is responsible for the creation of the Face have little to no information to base their beliefs on.

In the end, though, we know that the little landform called the Face of Mars is just one of our universe's great mysteries.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
B3E7D63C93C2,"The Face of Mars is not created by aliens, NASA's Viking 1's picture was only thought as "" made by aliens"" because of the shadows. In 2001 NASA took another picture of the Face on Mars, but with better resolution. It was proved that the Face was in fact just a natural landform in Mars, called a mesa. One reason this was not created by aliens was because the Face was found around Cydonia, a region in the Red Planet. A Martian mesa were common around Cydonia.

First of all, It only looked like a face because of the unsual shadow that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoah. Scientist from NASA even took picture of the Face more than 20 times already, and as the resolution got better; pictures of the Face got more clear, and one can see that it is just another landform in Mars that look like a landform on Earth. Scientists already proved that Mars was once just like Earth, which meant there were many different, odd shape landforms. Even in Earth there are a bunch of landform that look like something else, so this means that Mars will also have odd shape landform.

Secoundly, one can be fooled by everything they see, even sugar look like salt. The point is, the Face in 1976 does kind of look like an Eqyptian Pharaoh but in the picture taken in 2001 showed that it look like a common landform from the American West. Just because it look like a Face does not means it was created by an alien life form. Currently there is no prove that alien life form even exists, if NASA ever found of about alien life form, the news will leaked out and the public will be able to see it. Do not be decieved, you can not just make up random fact just so satisfied your curiousity, look at the facts more then make a guess on what might have happened.

With using common sense, one can see that it is just another landforms in Mars that look like Lanforms from Earth. One might be thinking ""NASA could jusy be lying to us, the government does not want us to find out about alien life form in the first place"" that might be true, but why would the government release this news out in the fist place if they didn't want the public to find out about any alien life form. In the article it even stated that a few days later after NASA sees this they release it out for the public to see.

NASA's scientist have already told the public about how they found new kind of landforms on Mars, so that's one reason to know that there will be more; that does not means that aliens created these ""monument"". There is currently no proof that alien exist or even if they created this Face on Mars. Currently saying, this is just another amazing landform found in Mars that is unique abotu Mars. It also looks like the Face have eyes and nose, but it is just and illusion created by the shadows.

In Conclusion, you can say that this is an amazing landform that is created by God. It was release because NASA thought it would be a good way to engage the publin and attract attention to Mars, which it did. It also make others believe in aliens more than they ever did. This was a win-win for both the public and the scientists. As technology advanced we can see more clearly that it is just a natural landform that exist in Mars. It also proves that Mars might just once be like Earth because of their landforms. Instead of Venus as Earth twin's sister, Mars and Earth are look alike than ever. Garvin, Mars Global Surveyor even said it reminds him of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.",4,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
ECD0248B4146,"The Unusual Rock Formation

When the ""Face of Mars"" was discovered many people had very different accusations and claims. Many people(including scientists) thought it was created suddenly by aliens. Although, that can be a possibility, it really wasn't the case for this certain situation. The reason being, was because NASA along with its scientists have many reasons for the ""Face of Mars"" to be a just a natural landform on Mars. They even have enough evidence to supprt their perspectives of the identity of the ""Face of Mars"".

First, the scientists took many sharpening images to see all the specific details of the this natural rock formation. In the article, it states that photographing Cydonia became a priority of NASA. That this huge rock formation was only made by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The scientist not only took one photo, and were done with the discovery, they took many photos. As the article shows that they took many photos from 1976, 1998, and 2001, the scientists took the information they had, and came to a conclusion, that this was only a gigantic rock formation.

Furthermore, when the scientists took the photos, they also discovered that this landform didn't have anything unusual because they can basically see everything from their spacecraft. As the article states, they took the digital image three times bigger than the pixel size. This mean that the scientists throughout the years have made this photos more and more sharpenly to see all the details, and see exacly what this mystery of a rock formation is. So, when they took the pixel size larger and larger they realized they reached the end of their discovery. The reason was because it was really zoomed it, that even if there were Egyptian-style pyramids or small shacks you could see them.

Then, even though the concluding statement was that it was only a rock landform, many people argue that it was an usual formation created by aliens. Scientists and other people believe it was an alien aritifact. Even though the scientists couldn't get a valuable picture of the formation because of the wispy clounds, many people believed that it was skeptics alien markings hidden by the haze. On the other hand, this couldn't be true because aliens could easily still cover the formation, but that didn't happen because the scientist ended up taking realistic photos of the face rock.

In conclusion, the ""Face of Mars"" is only a simple rock landform with an unusual formation of a human face. There are many reasons why,including the photos, and how they came to be much sharper and detailed by the range of the pixels. Also, the rock formation was in Cydonia, whcih really wan't a mysterious plant, considering that NASA immediately got informed by it.

Even though, there has been enough evidence in photos, many people believe it was created mysteriosly be aliens. In the end, it's just a landform in a whole different planet, so how can one simple face-like formation be created by aliens?    ",5,The Face on Mars,Text dependent

In argumentive situation everyone has there own opinions. But with somethings it makes no sense what they're trying to prove. if i was in an argument with someone who thought there was life on the planet Mars i would try to prove how. In space its hard to say theres life in space because scientist have no proof ,no data, or evidence there could be. For there to be a face on mars is hard to believe and for an alien to make it no evidence adds up.

No one really had an exact reaction to the face because all they were assuming there is life on mars. The public started saying theres aliens up there. But the size of the head was two miles and contiued to stare back at everyone. But some people were realistic saying that their was another Martian mesa they were common around cydonia but this image made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh. So none of the scientist put alot of thought into it but its the people who escalted the theory and image.

The people who thought there was life the rock formation of how it looked gave an illusion of a head, nose, eyes,and a mouth. The public was so dedicated to proving there was and they could prove it. But some other people and scientist were explaining that there is no life. The more people started talking and hearing about it became a bit more fake and hard to believe. This theory of the face started becoming in Hollywood flms, books, magazines and just made up stories.

Nasa begun to get frusterated and there budget started decreasing. Nasa actually wished it was acient civilizationon mars instead. Scientist started blieving that the face was alien artifact. So they started photographing Cydonia as i priority. When they started photographing more and more they were sorta getting somewhere. But they finally sent out Mars Global Surveyors and flew obver to Cydonia and they took a picture. The picture was ten times better and sharper than the original photos they had with the viking.

Nasa tried to get alot more photos and were gettiing no where becuase of the main reason the weather. But on April 8, 2001 it was a cloudless summer day in Cydonia go a perfect view of the face. Soon Nasa made a conclusion the picture actually looked like the Martian Equivalent. A butte or messa they were landforms common around the American West. Scientist they can finally put an end to the rumor saying theres life over there. Now everyone can know the actual truth with with this whole conspericy.

Getting to an argument with someone about is ther life on mars. Or is there really a face on mars. But i think the argument is clear who would be right. There's just to much evidence proving theres no and what they saw is an illusion of a face. Sometimes you just need proof to an easy fact of what is hard to figure out.",3,The Face on Mars,Text dependent
