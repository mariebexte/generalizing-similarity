F89BF21BC207,"Driveless cars seem to be the next big invention people want to see. It seems like a great idea in general, but it would take a long time to get these cars approved and in a state where it would become the norm to own or use one. The money and time taken to develop these cars would be of better use elsewhere, these cars would cause unnecessary issues, and they also would endorse human laziness.

I do not think these cars should come to existence because of the time and money that they would take to develop. Even if they do use less fuel, the money that it takes to manufacture them is so great that I am sure their selling price would also be rather high, making it hard for common people to afford one. Only richer individuals would be able to afford these with ease. It just does not feel practical.

The passage also mentions issues that could arise between manufacturer and consumer. Where would the blame fall in the event that this new technology fails? Different laws and regulations would have to be created in order for these cars to be safe on the roads. Maybe the car will not know how to react to pedestrians and accidentally hits one and injures them. It would be hard to draw a line of who is to blame in those kinds of situations.

Lastly, I just do not like the idea. Because it endorses human laziness. Humans are already becoming more sedentary and technology is always being developed that makes human life ""easier"", but the tech just makes it worse. All of these devices make it so a lot of people do not eve. Have to leave their homes or do much of anything. People become obese and develop health issues, shortening the life span of humans and also putting babies at higher risks for health issues. The driverless car would be another one of these technologies that contributes to this laziness.

In conclusion, I do not believe that driverless cars should be technology that we should use in the future. Something like developing the most energy efficient car possible would be of better use. Driverless cars waste unnecessary money in development, would cause unnecessary issues, and endorse the already lazy behaviors of human beings.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
F42D7D2B6B32,"Driverless cars could be one of the best inventions in the world if they worked 100% of the time and did not need any help from a human. For now though they are still a very useful invention. There are many reasons why they would and will be in the future. Some of the reasons are, reduced human errors, reduced accidents, and less fuel usage.

If driverless cars became fully automated to the point that a driver does not even have to do anything; is when human errors connected to driving will be close to eliminated. Humans may interfear with the car every so often and cause it to do something unintended, but for the most sake it would have no errors. Being able to drive without ever having crashes would be awesome. For one there would never need to be arguements about who hit who or money down the drain because of one stupid mistake. It would help people save money if they had a car that never crashed because there was no error. It could possible help the economy if people did not ever have to put money towards fixing their car after a crash. It could also reduce the amounts of death and injury from car crashes. Which would also reduce their money spent on hospital bills and inshurance. Driverless cars could be helpful in many ways, and reducing human error could help save people money and injury.

Accidents are very bad no matter how it happens. One way accidents should not happen is car crashes. If everyone followed the rules of the road, there would be no car crashes, but not everyone follows those rules. If there was driverless cars there would be no accidents, because every car would follow the rules of the road. Cars do not text and drive last time I checked. They also do not drink and drive, call and drive, or eat and drive. They do one job only, drive. We think phone calls or responding to texts is urgent no matter the time. Well, we are wrong, I would rather keep my life rather than risk it for a text or phone call, and the same goes for drinking and driving. I would rather take a cab home than risk drinking and driving, not only because it is illeagal, but because it is also dangerous. Your life is the most important thing in the world, and a driverless car can help you savor that. For no one wants to die a death that could have been avoided.

Less fuel usage in cars would be amazing. One reason is no one likes to spend extra money if they do not have to. Lower cost is something we can all agree on. Also it would reduce our usage on the oil we are using up. If the driverless cars would reduce the fuel usage it could help us savor what we have less of, because at some point it will be gone, and when it does we need a backup plan. If we could cut our fuel usage in half right now, it could give us some time to think of something else to fall back on when we get close to losing all of our resources. Driverless cars could be the first step towards that goal.

Driverless cars could have a huge impact on the world we live in today. From saving lives to saving money to saving our resources, driverless cars are expected to help the world a lot. They will be able to help people that are careless today, which could end up savning a life down the road. Driverless cars will be a new start to a new beginning.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
61B11F508FC5,"Driverless cars is certainly an amzing idea. It has captured the ideas of filmakers and writers around the world. It is a great idea and should be pursued. The reason for this is because it would make the roads safer, and give people more free time.

The reason this is a great idea is because a driverless car would make the roads much safer. There would be very little room for human error. If all cars were driverless operating under the same systm then they would always be doing the same things, meaning they would never crash into each other. With new technological advances in society, we would be able to create new sensors that could locate the objects around them and drive on the road. The article already list a few of the advances in sensors that can lead to very safe cars.

This would also give people much more free time. You can do things on the internet within your car that you would not have been able to do otherwise, considering the idea from the article about the heads-up displays. Also if you had a systme driving your car for you, you could travel at much higher speeds. The car would never leave the road because of a jerk of a hand. They would run, completely safe at higher rates of speed, giving people more time to do the things that they need.

These are just two of many reasons why we should have driverless cars around the world. It would be a huge step in society and technology. We need driverless cars to make the roads safer and to give people more free time. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
726882F01741,"The idea of automated driverless cars seems like an invention from a utopian future, but it csuses many potential problems when humans are involved. The question of how to punish a robot arises with the invention of this technology, as well as what the affect on humans would be of having everything done for you by robots. Although this idea is promising and could still be used. Automative transport is quite the visionary idea despite its falacies.

The introduction of driverless cars would warrant the creation of new rules of the road, but that raises the question of whether the passenger or the robot recieves punishment. Also, how would one punish a robot for breaking the law? They are not human so any punishment would be unaffective. Also based on the imformatiom given in paragraph 7, humans might be required to remain partially in control, and if the cars are partial human controlled, how would we guarrentee that the person arrested was actually the offender? The robot could have framed the human.

Another negative side-effect of driverless cars would be that humans could become too lazy and unalert. The human is not required to be alert to the situation of the road, so humans might lose the ability of knowing how to drive. There is also an increasing dependance on machinery to do our jobs for us, and machines are known to not be as capable as a human if there is a problem. Also, if a robot malfunctions while a human is in the car, there would be the question of how the human would handle that situation.

Although, to remain positive about the idea, there are several alternatives that alleviate these potential catastrophies. The idea could still be utilized via public transport. Based on the large amount of sensors that are required for the vehicles to work, ass outlined in paragraph 3 and 4, areas that have little interference would be ideal for these automated cars. Subways run underground where there is an asbsence of human activity, this would be a perfect enviornment for automated transport to be implemented. Another place that is devoid of human interferrence is the ocean. There could be automated cruiseliners that can transport people across water, where there is a lack of traffic problems.

In conclusion, the idea for automated cars is a potentially dangerous and complex, but the idea should not be thrown out. The problems with false accusations and how to punish an automated car arise; as well as the fact that humans could become lazy and unalert in their enviornment. These problems could potentially be solved by changing the venue of where automated transportation is utilized.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
744328F7168F,"Innovation for the future. That is what is occuring right now as you read this. Driving your own car is a thing of the past with the new up and coming invention of driverless cars.

New ideas are sprouting on how to make the semi-autonomous vehicle into a fully autonomous vehicle. Wasting your time by driving will be a thing of the past. Driverless cars would be an excellent invention due to the increased safety measures that will enable safer road conditions.

Google cars are semi-autonmous and have driven more than half a million miles without a crash which shows how safe they are. This is due to the increased safety measures that ""still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" This shows how the google cars are able to drive the easy, everyday road trips to work, school, or home; which is what the majority of one's car is used for. Yet, when the car encounters a circumstance that is more complicated, it will not try to navigate through the complicated circumstance, but instead alert the driver to take over. This shows how safe the car is because it is able to notice when a situation is too complicated for it to handle and then alert the driver of the impending situtation. Therefore, google cars would increase the safety of road conditions.

BMW's Dr. Huber has researched ways that will sustain the driver's awareness in an autonomous car, even though the driver is not actually driving. BMW has stated that they will bring in heads-up displays that ""can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take oversomething not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" This shows how the driverless cars inventors are thinking of every aspect to these new driverless cars, not only the manufacturing aspect, but also the psychological aspects. The displays will sustain the driver's attention even while they are not actually driving, but will turn off the instant the driver needs to take over. This is much safer than what we have today because these displays are not something available to the majority of people who text and drive. Therefore, the new driverless cars will increase safety due to their innovative way of sustaining the driver's attention.

Also, the sensors in today's car have increased safety, which shows how sensors in the upcomign cars will only increase safety even more. Some vehicles have sensors and ""the information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" The anti lock brake system has created safer road contions due to the fact that the sensors do the work so the driver does not have to. As the driver brakes, the information from the sensors alerts the car on how much pressure to apply and so forth, thus enabling the car to come to a quicker stop which increases the safety on roads. This shows how the driverless cars would be able to do all the work for the driver which increases the safety.

All in all, driverless cars would make the roads a safer place due to technological innovation. The many positive aspects that the driverless cars would provide would make the world a much safer place to be. So the next time you don't feel like driving, think of the up and coming driverless cars.                          ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

This will all come with the power of someone to sit in a car and do aboslutely nothing. The car would do everything for you. "" They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the drvier when the road ahead needs human skills"" these cars could bring an end to a tradition that has gone on for hundreds of years. the tradition of a parent teaching their child to drive. These cars are going to be the end to the world we know today.

There are hundreds of crashes every year from people not paying attention while driving. That number will only go up with these cars. The cars can drive themselves; however, what if when the driver is needed the most they are to busy texting or playing games on their phone. It has been a privelige for the past 60 years to get to learn how to drive. To get that responsiblity to sit behind the wheel of a car. With these cars they are giving that responsiblity to just about anyone. Has this society really downgraded so much that we are to the point of the safety of those around us doesn't matter.

""Google cars aren't truly driveless"", but what happens when they become fully drivless? More bank robberies, shootings, bombings, etc. With this cars we are giving these people easier ways to escape from the police from being put away for their crimes. These cars would allow murders to get away and not have to worry about their prints anywhere since the car drives it self. If anything these cars will be the beginning of a worse generation.

""In the 1980s, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes.""

These cars have been in the making for over 30 years and they still haven't come out with a safe and easy way to make it work. That should be a big red flag to get people to realize how unsafe these cars could be to everyone. What would happen if the car didn't brake in time and because of that it kills a group of children who's to blame there? The car becuae it can drive itself. The maker because the car should of stopped itself. Or the driver who sat back and didn't do anything to stop the car.

The privelige to drive has been pasted down over the years and now there is a possiblity that it will eventually stop. The idea of a car driving itself should be terrifying. However, to a lot of people it makes sense, since we are to an era where phones can type by themselves. So why can't cars drive themselves. This idea of no one driving could end the world as we know it or be the break to an new era. It's up to the people in this generation to decide if we want to pass the experience of actually driving down to our childern or if we don't find it useful to them. If we don't then we might as well get rid of all the cars we have now.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
87E09CE6EEAA,"Driverless cars. What are they? They are the future altohugh no one knows that 100% I believe that they are becasue as my generation and as the next generation grows sure we are all verry smart but we dont use our potential anymore at all. For example this is one of the esiest test and yet some people still fail it. How I do not know the answer to that. Anyways my point is that we are lazy really lazy and we want people/ AI's to do our jobs and objectives for us so we dont have to put in any work. Has it always been this way? sometimes I ask myself this question and no it hasent. I have whitnessed many things in my lifetime and I have done a lot in my lifetime. Personaly the google car is great I have seen them and many poeple I know have tested them, But what have we learned about evolution its good and bad well just think of the whole Jurasic Park story the pople want more they get more and then they somehow mess it up. There are many people who belive it is good and then there are the ones who think it is bad I personaly think it is a step in the wrong way, becasue it makes us worse as a human race. Sure not everyone would be able to afford one but eventualy they will and we will al be like the movie Walle have you seen that movie its messed up a bunch of overweight people in a space ship probably becasue they had self driving cars lets be real. All jokes aside we could and it is verry likely to end up like that. Not just from self driving cars but also from thinks that will come after that maybe next we will have self flying planes and that would put me ou tof my job of being a pilot. Just think of how many kids dreams are being crushed that want to be drivers for people they can't do that anymore because all the cars will be driving themselvse. Yea think about all the little kids dreams you are crushing. Also what would happen to insurance on cars if you mess up now is it your fault or the cars fault and then in turn the manufactures fault. This was what paragraph nine was about. This would crush our economy, sure people would be buying the car-> Great for the company-> Not great for jobs. maybe you could tell those insurance companies and drivers ""Hey since we took your job and messed up your whole life lets put you in a factory where you can build more cars like the ones that ohh wait rememer those the ones that TOOK YOUR JOB"" yea happy ending right? People would get payed a lot less and if google was the only one who released it then that is called a monopaly yes you thinking like the game yea you know where you try to buy out basicaly the whole economy just for one thing and you better hope you dont land on the go to jail spot becasue if you do your SOL (well im sure you know what that means). i hope i made someone laugh not its not the best essay but you have gottent this far and i hope you laughed at least a little. ""Ohh but wait theres more for only $4.99 you could own your verry own self driving car and (wait for it) and free airfreshener"" well thats dandy lets buy one i got to get that google airfreshener it probably smells amazing. No it doesnt you know why because it doesnt exist. probably does honestly. So there are two ways you can go about this the world can get stupider and stupider with this evolution and the people in the world its like a circus not good at all but then AI would control the world ohh thats fine lets just you know give our nukes to computer and hope that it doesnt get mad at us and blow us up. see then the AI would hold the most power in the world the president would be like one atom in sometihng that has 100,000,000 atoms thats like a fly on a winsheild its powerless. You know you shouldnt kill flys on winsheilds you know why? hmm ill tell you later you just have to keep reading. this is probably a pain for you to read. But this is very well what could happen in not my lifetime nor yours becasue your obviosuly older than me whoever is grading this paper. Im guessing about a few generations that self driving cars will be the norm maybe my lifetime probably not thought hmm I dont know.

Ohh yes that was just my introduction are you read for the next two paragraphs that you have to read. Well first guess what this one is also wabout self driving cars but it is about there saftey (with more jokes). Why does the car cross the road??? ... To get to the other side I know pretty good I came up with that one myself. Ohh wait they die thats what happends when you kill flys on the winsheild the fly dies after it cries and tries to synthisize. you know as a human you can control that, but as a car that is opperated by an AI it wouldnt know if you kiled the fly or not it could just turn on the wippers and gone that fly is. Also the person is at risk if the car messes up and your not paying attention then waht happens you could get hurt really badly and whoes fault is it then how do you prove in court that the car crashed not you or what if the car wanted to crash becasue it didnt like you and you treated it poorly. Also whay happens if you are speeding and then the cop pulls you over and says sir do you know how fast you were going and you so no my car was driving itself sorry sir. Then is it your fault or the cars.

4EC13202EA24,"As the years go on and we grow what also grows is the advancement of technology. Since the new era of technology has taken place the possibilites have become endless. Years back they didnt even have electric window control it was all done with a handle that you had to turn and turn until your window opened. Looking back on that compared to this day and age we have cars that are so close to driving themselves is that the safest idea no, but in my mind i think its a great idea to make self driving cars because everything technology wise is growing rapidly so we cant just leave cars old and boring we need to keep up with the technology we have at this time in our lives and make something new and awarding.

So we all know how many safety concerns we face in cars when on the road and this is exactely why people believe we shouldnt have self driving cars. Therefore i believe self driving cars are getting a bad rep without even getting a chance. if you dont test an idea you will never know if it would have worked or not and with the technology we have today i believe that in the near future sometime soon we will have a full self driving car. I understand that it will be hard to do and i agree that it can be very unsafe and so thats where the trial and error part comes in you have to try new things to know fior sure if they will work and i can say now that in the near future if we do end up having self driving cars that everyone who uise to say dont try it its not safe will themselves be buying self driving cars.

In conclusion, i know that the speculation with self driving cars is odd but the real truth of the matter is that thats our future. Every few years new inventions come by surprise and shock the world and this is just another thing that i can confidently say will come soon and take the world by surprise. Will there still be people trying to get rid of this invention? of course people will try but thats the key to sucess having people say things about what you have made and making it something so big that those same people will be shocked that ever thought something bad of you.

I would oppose this idea again is because the liabilitity of the acciendent. And the last reason would be just too many distractions all around and risk everything around when you can just drive normally. Also known as being lazy.

First, the thing on with this driverless thing is crazy. They are so many things that can get in your ways and mess you up. All it takes is a couple of seconds to end up in a wreck. and all of that can be avoid by just simiply driver yourself around.

Second, with all that drama with the driverless thing. There would a lot of complaining about it. And say if someone got an injury by one of these driverless cars that google has came out with. Whose fault would it be the driver or the manufacture that made the car. Who will ever known because people would lie to save themselves and also get a lawsuit on the people who made the car. and tha would save a lot of time and money if they would have just stuck to the regular car.

Last but not least the people who make the car will have a ton of lawsuits on their desks. To save all this time they should just keep the cars the same and work on preventing those cars even safer before they decide on doing something else. this is what i would call pure lazieness. In my opinoin we should not what to take the chance of injurying someone.

Technology is advancing to the point of driverless cars and they will be seen more in the near future. Though severl might think that having driverless cars can be dangerous, the technolgy advancing will make it to where you might not have to buy a car in the future. Driverless will be safe to drive on the roads even without a driver.

Sensors on the car can keep you from danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. Sensors are nothing new, but with the technology advancing since the 1980s automakers can make a car that allows far better responce and control than a human driver. With futher improvments on computer hardware and sensors, automakers can design car that can handle more driving tasks on their own.

The anitlock brake and driver assticance system has made its own way on helping the full invention of driverless cars. Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that with the technolgy progressing consumers can have a driverless cab take us wherever we would like to go. Along with the sensors the radar will help with the antilock system to make that dream come ture.

BMW has already annouced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". It's a car the can handle driving up to 25 mph, but touch sensors keeps the driver holding the wheel in case of a malfunction. The human driver must remian alert and be able to take over in certain situations. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road.

Several may argue that a driverless car is not safe. A variety of car companies have and are developing safety devices to assure the safety of everyone. GM has developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Automakers and manufacturers are assuring your safety while deveopling the future.

Safety is the number one key to the adevances of driverless cars.

Thes variaty of cars can be useful for those who have trouble keeping their eyes on the road. There are multiple reasons why driverless cars are useful but could be also negitive vehicles to us. Just keep reading to find out why.

All the driverless cars sounds so good and cool to us but most people would buy them because of what they and what they could do for them. Even though these cars came watch out for us and have vibrating seats and designed to do work and things like that but what if the car colaps? Anything can break and some things cant be fixed. Just imagine youre driving this new car and boom! it stops. You might think you need gas or oil change but really, everything broke down. Nothing is working the way you bought it.

9AC1364B5A09,"Having to not worry about not staying alert constantly or saving up for a new car over a life time are a just a few benefits we could potentially recieve with the development of driverless cars. I feel that scientists and developers should continue the development of driverless cars because with this new technology the rate at which an accident occurs could potentially be decreased, the amount fuel used to operate a car would be cut in half, and if you ever decided to operate manually, the vehicle could apply its advanced accident safety systems before an accident has the oppurtunity to take place.

One reason why the development of driverless cars should be continued is because they can prevent accidents from occuring. Being built with the new technology allows these vehicles to stop when needed, slow down when entering harsh conditions, or alert the driver when an accident could potentially occur. These types of safety features could prevent head on collisons, hydroplaning on roads, and accidental traffic violations.

Another reason why the development of driverless cars should be continued is because they can cut the amount of fuel needed to power a vehicle by half. This is important because in today's modern day scientists have discovered that the amount of fossils fuels fuels in the world is decreasing exponentially. At that rate, they say that within the next five hundred years there will be no more fuel left. With the development of these types of vehicles, scientists have the ability to cut the amount of fuel needed in half, which could increae the number of years to one thousand.

The last reason for why the development of cars should be continued is because they can provide anticipated accident safety features. What I mean by this is that before a collision takes place, the advanced sensors constructed inside the car are able to detect an accident and provide an earlier response. This could mean that they will deploy airbags earlier or even apply substantial pressure to the brakes hundreds of feet away from opposing harm.

To say that driverless cars would be benficial is an understatement because they have the ability to change the world. Their new features could end the number of accidents involved with vehicles.

F079BD9C0C31,"I think it would be cool to have a driverless car. I would say that even in a driverless car, the driver should still be able to take control when needed. I think we should keep it to where the driver could take control whenever, because of road construction. I would say that a driverless car, with also control of a driver would be fine.

I would say it's fine because, Google has drove driverless cars under specific conditions since 2009. They have driven more than hald a million miles without a crash. I think they are saying it is safe. Also, the Google cars aren't actually driverless because, they are alerted when to do something. These alerts are for example, when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, as in roadwork or accidents.

I think it would be cool to have one when you need to answer an emergency call. It will be safe to answer the call, because if you need to take control it will alert you. If someone was injured, I would say it would be the manufacturers fault. I would say it's the manufacturers fault, because they are the ones who made it, they were in control of making the car the whole time.

I would say a driverless car would be safe, in only some conditions. These conditions would be, when the car alerts the driver when they need to step in and drive. Another condition would be where the car would know where the road construction sites are, and would take the clear path to get to the destination of where the driver wants to go.

Blame it on the car for speeding who would take responsiblty for that or, what about the bad people in this world what if they get a hold of the car they can proabaly turn it againist us for bad or, what if your on your phone and you and you think the car is driving for you but its time for you to take control of the car and your not paying atttention that can cause alot of car recks or accidence that can probably kill people.

03259FDA2D4E,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are coming"" the author presents both posititve and negative apects of driverless cars. In my opoinion I am against the development of these cars. I think that this cars are not safe, and would be to expensive.

Firstly, the driverless cars in my opinion are not safe. I think this because technology can always go wrong no matter how much time or money is spent on it. You just never know when it can go wrong. For example, in the article it is stated that traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safest car has human driver control at all times. So it is insane that people are trying to develop a driveless car when by the law it is proven to not be safe. Another example is in the article it states that if technology fails and someone is injured who would the fault lie on. So this shows that with driverless cars technology will fail at any time, and can cause accident on innocent people who in the first pplace where never in support of driverless cars.

Secondly, the driverless cars should not be developed because they are to expensive not only for individual people but for the country. For example, in the article it states that the smartroad sytems work surprisingly well, but that they require a massive upgrades to exsisting roads, that was simply to expensive to be practical. Driverless cars would require the upgrade of not only a part of Indianas road but the whole U.S. and the world. Which is a tremendous amount of money that would be needed to upgrade all the roads. Driverless cars do not only need upgrades in road to be safer and work better, but the car itself needs alot of expensive technology to operate correctly and safely. For example, a driverless car needs spinning sensor on the roof, dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form constant updating 3-D model os the car's surroundings, and so much more is needed for the driverless car to mimic the skills of a human at the wheel.

In conclusion, driverless cars are not and will not be any much safer then a human at the wheel, and the cars are to expensive and would be a waste of money for the country. Driverless cars will fail at some point because tehcnolgy fails, so why risk the life of innocent people. The cars are to expensive, so why waste so much money on driverless car. They are not needed but are only a desire of human imaginaiton, inclsuive a luxury for many.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
DE0275A222C1,"What is my position on a driverless car? I believe with enough improvments and optimization it could be a great substitute for real drivers and offers some great advantages with some disadvantages as well. As they currently are however I don't believe they can be substituted fully instead of a real driver. However with enough improvment and bug fixes they certainly could be.

Why couldn't they be used fully now? They aren't really as reliable as they need to be so they can't be used instead of real person. Driverless cars don't seem to have the ability to deal with unknown stimulus such as an accident on the road, therfore it is ill equip to make an apropriate decision to avoid these situations. And it appears the they can't handle speeds that you would find on the highway. Driverless cars aren't perfect but they do have some advantages along with the disadvantages.

First of all they have bulit in GBS so they wouldn't get completely lost like a human can. If there tech is advance enough they could avoid danger more effectively since a computer can react faster than human. There would be a decrease in mortality rate on the road because there wouldn't be as much danger paying attention somewhere else like being on you phone since you aren't the one driving. The amount of money you'd spend on gas would decrease since it would always drive the most cost saving speed.( while staying in bounds of the speed limit of course) You could be more productive with your days since you would be spending less time driving the car.

But currently they aren't advanced enough to take over driving fully from a person. The GBS tachnology that we currently have is faulty and will often make mistakes. The Cars sensors could malfunction causing it to speed up or slow down to rapidly causing a accident. They Currently can't make the apropriate decisons to avoid a accident or navigate around a roadblock. Also it can't really go speeds that you would find on a highway safely.

Now here are some of my suggestions to where they could get to the point where they are useable. There would need to be a large amount of servers set up to help the cars to make all the correct calculations. The censors on the cars would need a serious improvement so that they would be able to take acquire the correct data from the envronment. They would also need a better built in computers to process and interpret all the data. All of this development would increase the number of available jobs around the world helping out the economy. The driverless car isn't a reality but with enough effort it sure could be. Of course i'm no expert so take these suggestions at face value.

So in conclusion no they shouldn't currently be developed. They have a lot of problems that need to be addressed before hand. However in a few years they certainly could be. Technology needs to catch up with the concept because it currently isn't as reliable as they need to be. People also need to change they're perspective on them if they are going to go anywhere. They have a lot of potential and I would love to see them live up to it one day. What about you?       ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

We are barley affording to pay teachers let alone have money to pay for reaserch and materials. My final reason is because they are just pointless. Without drivers that would put so many people out of a job.

My first reason is because they are dangerous. Anything can go wrong and end up killing innocent people. Technology has malfunctions everyday and sometimes we dont know why. No person or people should loose their lives because people are too lazy to drive their own vehicals.

My next reason is because they cost too much. Here in Richmond, Indiana we are barley affording to pay for schooling and teachers let alone driverless cars. Driverless cars should be the least of our worries at the moment. Instead of focusing on driverless cars, we should focus on how to lower the cost of an education. Education should be our number one priority.

My final reason is because they are pointless and would put many people out of a job. With driverless cars, taxi drivers, bus drivers, and many others would be out of a job. The passage says "" Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore?"" That statement proves that many jobs will be lost because people are getting too lazy and too pre occupied to drive on their own.

2041F435BCE9,"The idea of Driverless cars in the future can be a very controversial topic. Many may say that it is too dangerous, but others argue that there are ways to ensure safety and that these cars are the future of technology. In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author presents both sides of the argument. After reading the article, I have come to conclusion that Driverless cars are a positive change in technology and can be used for the better.

Google has already invented the driverless car and has been making improvements for years. The car contains sensors on the wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted on the rear view mirror, a GPS reciever, and an intertial motion sensor. All of these things are used in the car to ensure you are provided with a safe ride. Because of Google and their invention of the Driverless car, in the future this could be the public transportation system. These care would use half the fuel that taxis use today and a driverless car offers far more flexibility than a bus. Paragraph 5 states, ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own"" This quote is showing that all the sensors and cameras that they have inserted into the car make it safe to ride in and make it so that the car is mimicking how it would drive with a person behind the wheel.

In conclusion, The google driverless car is an invention that could change the future and they way that we get places. There are both positives and negatives found while testing these cars and making improvements. Overall, with all of the sensors put in the car to ensure safety, google can make it possible to have a safe ride in the car. Once all improvements have been made to the driverless car, it will change the future of transportation. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

I am strongly for driverless cars because they let you relax at the wheel by driving. Another reason I am for driverless cars it will allow the roads to be safer. The last reason I am for it is they will allow pedestrians to use public transpertation with out there life in risk.

How will a driverless car let you relax at the wheel. A driverless car will let you relax at the wheel during traffic jams up to speeds of 25 mph. The only thing you would have to do during a traffic jam is keep your hands on the wheel. The car will make you keep your hands on the wheel by using sensors. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents.

Would anybody have ever thought there would be cars that dang near can drive their selves with out hurting anybody. Well the car designers are getting close. There are sensors on on some of these cars that will allow the car to brake instantly if the car is out of controll skids or roll overs. When these cars come out it will allow them to brake before running off the road. Without the option of smarter roads maufactures turned to smarter cars that can steer them selves.

World transportation with out worrying about the driver wrecking. There would not be no worrying if there were driverless cars. The google cofounder forsees these public transpertations using have the fuel that we use tody on cars. he beleives such cars would fundamentally change the world.

D1FDAD4E985C,"The development of driverless cars is something new. People do not really know how to feel about it. Some people love the idea. Others, not so much. People are convinced that technology is a waste of time and cannot make our lives easier. What they don't realize is, these cars are actually pretty helpful.

Driverless cars are made to know that something bad is going to happen on the road before you do. They are designed to alert you when they see something you cannot. Some driverless cars can even stop themselves before you even get a chance to put our foot on the break. Driverless cars are designed to keep people safe and make our lives easier.

Driverless cars can greatly help decrese the amount of accidents that happen. There are accidents everyday. Some are even fatal. With these driverless cars and the advanced technology they have, can you imagine how much the number of accidents would decrese? These cars are designed to keep you safe on the road. Yes, these cars still need human direction on some things, but they are still able to keep you safe and worry free when drving.

Driverless cars have already been made in some places. They have been manufactured and driven by people who think that the idea of driverless cars is a good one. These cars have been tested countless times just to make sure that everything runs smoothly. Driverless cars aren't for everybody though. And that is ok. Some people just don't like the idea of having a car do everything for them.

If you do happen to have a driverless car or are planning to get one, don't think that you don't have to drive anymore. Yes, these cars will do a lot of things for you that you can do yourself, but they are not going to drive you to wotk everyday. They still need human guidance. These cars are desgined to watch the driver as the driver watches the road. So what that means is that, while your changing the radio station or looking for something in your backseat, the car will automatically alert you if anything unsafe is on the road.

These cars are pretty amazing if you ask me. But don't get me wrong, they aren't flawless. Technology is something that we learn more about everyday.

With all the traffic out there you get tired of stoping and going, then hitting the gas then the brake. Well now you dont have to do any of that with driverless cars. They'll do it on their own, all you have to do is steer at times. So, with having driverless cars they will do less harm to the enviroment, safer for your freinds and family, and it's easier on you.

First, the driverless cars are less harm to the enviromen. Just think of all the taxis out there in the big cities wasting all the gas that we put into them. It harms the enviroment way too much. With these special driving cars it's a proved fact that they use half of the fuel today's taxis use. That means it's not polluting the land as much and the oxygen will be cleaner and fresher as well. With all of the pollution going on our ozone layer is decreasing rapidly and ith the makings of these cars it wont harm the ozone layer as much now, and as a matter of fact it will help it.

Moving on, the driverless cars are all in all safer than modern day cars we drive everyday to world and back. At night when you cant see very well and your in the back country it can see up ahead way farther than you ever can. Here's a situation for you, say your driving along in a regular and a deer runs out of the field and SMACK! Now your calling a tow truck in the middle of night and your kids are scared. Now if you had the safe driverless car it could of hit the brakes because it saw the deer run out of the field, and now your driving home safe and your kids are safe. Don't worry about steering, the special car is made to do it. You can just sit back and relax and enjoy the ride to wherever you are going.

Lastly, you always want things to be easier on you right? Well now we have a solution for you. Instead of hitting the gas then the brake in the big cities, have the car do that for you. So you don't get fustrated of hitting the brake and gas you can just chill. This specialy made car can ultimately bring you a stress free life.

Now you can see that having a driverless car can bring you a better life. With all of the values it has you will never regret gettting one. If you're at the car lot and have to decide wether driverless and have to drive. I can count on you'll make the right choice.

Driverless cars do have a lot of positives. They are ecologicly friendly, so they save both gas and money. Also, they are way more flexible than a bus could be, since it can go anywhere. Not to mention they are way more safer than normal vehicles, alerting people who are distracted by anything while on the road. Speaking of safety, that seems to be a marjor area that is adressed. For instance, when there is a problem the car would state it and giver the passenger the option to take over. Another way is the cars expensive sensors that detect when there's going to be a problem, and automaticly breaks the car to avoid any damage.

However, there is some glaring issues that must be adressed. First off people will get bored beccause they are passengers. Plus being alarmed of this everytime your dozing off, by the car itself, isn't going to help anyone, just annoy them. On top of this driving cars is a rite of passage into adulthood.

While these ""driverless cars"" are envisioned to use ""half the fuel of today's taxis"" and ""offer more flexibilty than a bus"", there are still some aspects that don't make the cars completely ""driverless"". Before driverless cars make their huge impact on the world, some of the ""minor"" details need to be further developed.

How often do you hear of people calling for transportation services, such as taxis or Ubers, because they aren't in a state of mind and being good enough to be able to operate a motorized vehicle? If taxi systems were to be replaced with driverless cars, who would drive those people home? A major flaw in the driverless cars is that they might require human assistance sometime throughout the trip. If there were to be a spontaneous accident, or large work zone ahead while the only human in the car was intoxicated, that would pose a lot of danger for that driver and every other driver around. The safety of other drivers on the road has to be taken into consideration.

Making cars driverless means no one would be completely in control of the vehicle. Keeping that in mind, in the case of an accident, who would be to blame? The driver could be at fault, but then how really driver-independent are these cars? With the possibility that the car will more than likely need human assistance, the driver themselves is only slightly benefited.

Just because ""driverless cars"" are assumed as completely ""driverless"", an actual human capable of thinking and doing for the car is indeed necessary. Where I'm sure there are certain groups of people that will benefit from being able to get from point A to point B without having to think anything of it, there's still that larger population that will find almost no practicality in watching their vehicle drive itself when they are capable of doing it themselves.

Although a driver car has its perks like being able to park and re-route through traffic and accidents. However does a driverless car have pros and cons?

Yes a diverless car has it's pros and cons like if the Dubbed LIDAR (roof senser) went out than the car would not be able to mimic the skill of a human driver.

Now, these sensor help alert drivers to where a possibly dangerous situation is, but in the future they could be used as the ""eyes"" for the car.

AFE9B6AA1365,"I am against the development of these cars. The reasons i am against it is because for one, why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver ? like they mentioned in paragraph 8.

I feel like thats doing to much , if your going to invent a ""driverless car"" make it so that it can do everything by its self without the owners help, so that way the human can relax while the car does all the work.

For two, if the owner has to still do work and take over at certain times and certain parts whats the point?, you might as well just get a car you can control fully (a normal car) not a car that controls half the stuff you could be controling while you still have to conrtol certain parts/things.

What about new beginners that are just now learning how to drive ?, they need to know how to work/control the whole car NOT certain parts, what if they end up banning these ""driverless cars"" because its to many accidents and new beginners only know how to control certain parts because they were so used to the ""driverless cars"" that controlled most of the things in the car they arent used to the normal cars.

I honestly feel like they should just stick with normal cars and let the owners do all the work.

The owners are the ones paying for the car so why not let them control the car i could see if they werent making payments and stuff on the car and all they had to do was pay for it and its all theirs but their still going to have to make payments so why not let them control it themselves ?. What about if there is an accident the car shouldnt have to warn them anything, if the owner was paying attention to the road like your supposed to you would know if its an accident or if its about to be an accident. if someone is hurt who would be at fault the driver or manufacturer? i feel like it would be the manufacturer fault because their the ones that make these ""driverless cars"" thats supposed to do mostly everything and thats supposed to warn the driver when something bad happens.

What if the car makes a mistake and dont warn the driver ? , they should make it safe and confortable if thats the case because their the ones making these cars not the owner. It would honestly only be the drivers fault if they were the ones controling the whole car and all the parts because if they werent paying attention to the road and they controlled the car and an accident occurs then its 100% the drivers fault for not paying attention to the road like todays car , they wouldnt sue the manufacturer they really wouldnt even do anything because its the owners fault.

A long time ago people never had no cars but only horses and boats to travel. Scientists have alot of smart idea of techalnogly.

Scientists also created that only way if you could listen to the radio if your seat belt buckled in for safety.

Now if they start at 18 at list they'll be more mature for driving.

25 percent for accidents is because of drinking and driving. 35 percent is by falling asleep while still driving. 15 percent is by texting and driving. 25 percent is speeding to fast on the road cause accidents.

733A8B1972E5,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" I think driverless cars is a bad idea. It could harm people inside the car if anything goes wrong. If anything does go wrong with the car and if it hurts someone or even kill someone, manufactures will be blamed for the accident. The people wouldnt be able to trust the company anymore and the company will start to lose money beacuse people would stop buying their cars.

Developing these types of cars sound very cool, but the safety of these self-driven cars is a big concern. No one would want to take the risk of any problems with the car that could lead to their death. In paragarph 9 in the article it says "" if the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault - the driver or the manufacturer?"" the manufacturer should be responible if anything goes wrong. They should be responsible because they made the car and after one injury they should just stop the company of making more because they will continue to hurt people will their product. Somethign could go wrong with the car without alerting the driver and it could go out of control without anyway to stop the car.

Human drivers should have 100% control of their car, because if anything goes wrong it will be against the driver not the car. people trust them selfs better than the car. Some cars cant even handle driving their selfs on their own in some tasks and what if it doesnt alert the driver to take over, this could seriously lead to big accident.

If an accident does happen everything will be blamed against the company. The company will have charges agaisnt them. The company will be force to shut down before another accident can occur. The cars will be seen unsafe to drive, this will give a reason to the people not to buy these types of cars. If people stop buying self-driven cars the company will go bankrupt and everything will go to waste.

If new technology is taking over like cars, no one will know how to fix the car without help of the manufacters who knows what is going on. people wouldnt want to be charged just for them to check on the car and to know whats going on.

This is why I think this is a bad idea. People can get hurt or even killed. I rather stay in control of the car than let a computer take over.                ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
616F8E0EFABF,"""Can you imagine a time in the future when no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore""? As said in the being of ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the question is simple. I can say without a doubt that I can invision diverless cares in the future. Although I can hope for sooner rather than later that is one aspect I can not yet answer.

As I have already stated in the previous paragraph that I can invision this future, but I also support this future. The era of perfectly calculating autonomous cars would be an era of complete safety on roads. The driverless cars not being subjected to human errors would not make the foolish mistakes that a human might make in situations like slick roads, alcoholic influence, and peer preasure. The only flaw with autonomous car that I can visualize is the possible glitches in it's programing that could be prevented with annual mantainance. As said in the article ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of todays taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus"" Although I do not see a public transport system being the only use of these cars I can agree with the amount of options and the decrease of polution put into our daily life styles.

In the end I fully agree with the use of driverless cars no matter what the primary use is for. With only minimum tolerance for errors in todays technology I do not see the likelyhood of an accident due to the fualt of the car. Although, as the article states, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault"". I refute this statement just as the article did it's self by saying ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved"".",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
FA7A5EC25DDE,"Cars have essentially become a necessity in this day and age, and technology that surrounds them is becoming more and more complex everyday. Based on this, it was only a matter of time before the idea of driverless cars came about. A controversial ides which is already being sold commercialy worldwide. I am not a fan of this idea and feel that there are more negative aspects to the concept than positive. Based on the amount of fatal car accidents every year, data shows cars are already dangerous enough. Revoking a persons control of their car entirely will only make the problem worse.

Cars driving themselves sounds like a great idea, but in reality it is not. There have been an abundance of occasions where machines malfunction and cause serious or even fatal injuries. In fact, less than 20% of commercial plane crashes are caused by human error, meaning more than 80% the crash was caused by a problem at the manufacturer! Those number are scary to think about and this is on a much smaller scale than cars. Those numbers show that machines are not as reliable as humans. To give the machine complete control of your life is very scary, not only that it would be extremely dangerous.

As I stated earlier in the prompt cars are a necessity in this day and age, meaning that knowing how to drive is just as important. If these cars were placed on our streets and sold to the public, then generations down the line, the skill of driving would be lost. Knowing how to drive is an extremely important skill to have and these so called ""smart"" cars would extinguish this skill.

The idea of driverless cars is unrealistic, seeing the danger that comes with them. There would be way to many negative aspects than positive. Yes, you could sleep while you go to work, but death or injury is massive price to pay for laziness. Driverless cars in theory sounds like an amazing and innovative idea, however the idea is unrealistic, dangerous, and will only bring negative reprocautions.

I feel like when you have them you will have the oppurtunity to do much more then sit at home. I don't really think I would enjoy the driverless cars just because i love driving, but older people might enjoy it.

Driverless cars would take a lot of trust to be able to get in the vehicle and let it drive you at a high speed rate. To me at this moment i think driving is a blast and I don't understand why people do not like it. The idea of being behind the wheel of something that can travel you to just about anywhere in the world if you have the time and money to drive there. If we did end up creating driverless cars then we wouldn't worry about speeding a whole lot or the elders driving really slow.

I would worry way to much in a drverless car, eventhough I know the technolgy is through the roof. In my head there is way to many bad things that might happen: going off the road, the car has a power outage, the car just randomly starts to go faster when it needs to slow down. It is just that anything in the world could happen no matter how good our technology is there is going to be atleast one accident. Anything could happen I think it is too risky.

F9EBBBF6710E,"Driverless cars are very dangerous. I think that humans sound extremely lazy when we try so hard to push for driverless cars. We look for the easiest way out of everything. Cars already make traveling much easier than walking and now we want to not have to do anything while we travel. I think that driverless cars are dangerous and too expensive, and they should not be developed for the world to use.

Driverless cars are dangerous becasue you never know when something will go awry. Computers aren't always working and I would never want to put someone's life in the hands of something that is not reliable. For example somtimes I turn on my computer at home and it doesn't work the way it should be working. What would happen if that was in charge of your car? Although you don't have to do a lot in drivlerless cars you still must stay awake in them, and I think that people wouldn't take that seriously. That would put everyone's lives in danger that are driving around them. In the article it says that, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times."" These laws have been in place for a very long time and nothing too awful has happened, this law helps to keep people safe. I don't know anyone who would put their lives in the hands of a computer.

Another reason for driverless cars not to be developed is because they are too expensive. They would cost so much money to create and to fix and to have roads that adapt to the cars. Car companies would be spending even mroe than now to get these parts for cars that don't need to be made. The best driverless cars worked on special manufactured roads that were way too expensive to be practical. ""These smart-road systems worked surprisingly well, but they required massive upgrades to existing roads, soemthing that was simply too expensive to be practical."" If we cannot have the best for the people that we care about why would we want these nonreliable cars at all? The smart road systems were said to work the best, yet we are resorting to the unreliable manufactured cars that would carry the people we care about the most.

Overall I think that driverless cars make everyone seem lazy and reckless. Why can we not just stick with how far we have come with vehicle technology, instead of pushing towards cars that put people lives in even more danger than before. Driverless cars should be left for the movies and not for real life. Although they would make life easier soemtimes, they are too unreliable.

Creating driverless cars in the world seems like a big deal today. In all reality, having driverless cars around the world can be an accident just waiting to happen. If you really think about it, teenagers would most likely be the main ones buying driverless cars. Drinking while driving, texting, and falling asleep may accur when entering a driverless car. Is creating a car that drives on it's own really worth costing a life?

Drinking when driving is a huge mistake people tend to make. Giving them a car that works on its own, and allows you to sit there and get more drunk is not a very bright idea. ""They still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues, such as navigating through roadwork or accidents."" If you are drunk and the car alerts you to take control you may not even respond.

Texting and driving happens with anyone and everyone. People are way too focused on seeing what their friend sent them instead of paying attetion to the road. Alot of collisions have happend because of one driver texting and driving. "" Without the option of smarter roads, manufacturers turned to smarter cars- but how much smarter did the cars need to be? For starters they need a whole lot of sensors."" Say those sensors just happend to suddenly cut off and not give any warning. How will a person know when to look up from their addictive phone?

Working hard days 24/7 can make a person extreamly sleepy. Say you get off of work and your exhausted, and a peaceful song comes on the radio. While listening to that song you fall into a deep sleep while your car takes you back to your house. ""Their cars have driven more than half a mile without a crash."" Maybe the test cars didn't have a problem with the driverless cars but what if somthing breaks in your car and it loses control? The sleepy driver is in deep sleep and could die from the driverless car manufacturing.

In conclusion, having a driverless car does not make the world any safer nor better. It gives people a better chance to drink and drive, text and drive, even sleep and drive. How is making driverless cars anysafer yet better to the world?

In all reality, it makes it more dangerous. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
F340A53BBC32,"Are driverless cars a good or bad thing? In my opinion driverless cars can be a bad thing. These next few paragraphs will explain why I think this and all the cons of the cars.

If driverless cars ever do become a pratical thing one big problem we would have to worry about is the GPS or the LIDAR malfunctioning and the car doesn't know whats going on around it. If something like that did happen and the person in the car was not paying attention the car could seriosly indjure some one or it could total itself. A lot of these cars features rely on the fact that if something goes wrong then person behind the wheel is ready to take over but if some thing does go wrong and the the person is sleeping they could swerve into a semi-truck or a building. One of the biggest problems of this car is the fact that tech can stop working and cause accidents.

Another con of these cars is the fact that they could get hacked by other people. Recently in 2015 two people (with permission) hacked a car that was not even driverless they could control speed,steering,door lockes,brakes,and so on. Imagine what could happen if criminals hacked into these cars they could potentialy kill lots of people by making the cars crash into buildings,cars,and other things. Another problem is human error.

What if something does go wrong and the person is not ready to take over? I have touched on this a bit already but I'm going into a little more detail. Much like normal cars the driver has to be awake behind the wheel ,in the case of driverless cars, just in case they need to take over the wheel of the car. If someone is on a long drive and decide to let the car drive itself but as they are sleeping the cars malfunctions and the driver does not know they need to take over the car and the person could end up in in a ditch or end up crashing into another car or even worse a semi-truck. After these reasons and some others I think that these cars can be a bad thing on the road but only time can tell if thats the case.

Are driverless cars a bad thing? In my opinion yes they can be after reading the artical and looking at the facts i conclude that these cars could be a hazerd on the road.           ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
A7B069D3B600,"Hi my names Kaigen and I am against the idea of self driving vehicles. I honestly think it would cause more mayham. Just think about it, what if a deer runs out in front of your car. I know you are probably thinking they have some fool proof plan to avoid these incidents, but take out that word deer and replace it with a child. Yeah that changes things up a little huh. No matter how fool proof they claim their ""self driving"" cars are it a bad idea. Things happen, technology fails. Its a part of life.

The story even says 'the driver has to take control entering or leaving a driveway', or ""if theres road work it needs the driver to take over"". This is not ok. What happens when you are going through an intersection and the light turns red? Is the car going to speed up, or stop in the middle of the road. What if you are going through a school zone? Hows the car going to know any different? They also said in the article ""for this to work it would be espensive"". In my opinion the last thing we need is to go even further in debt. Yes I can see good in this idea, but i beleive the bad over rules the good in this instinse. Just imagine what would happen if a car pulled out in front of you, sure these machines will probably have a pretty good reaction time. But it can not be anywhere close to the reaction time of a frightened parent. Child saftey is the number one thing car manufactures need to be worried about. If they get the ""okay"" and come out with these i would want to see these flaws adressed before anyone puts a child in the vehicle. I am not saying its a bad idea, heck I even seee a time in the future where a car is driving me around. I just dont think they have everything figured out yet and i dont think they will have anytime soon. Its reasonable for these to come out on the market, they just need to meet all of the saftey regulations. I also beleive that if they are going to do the track cars, where they run on tracks like a train, that they would have to rip up every highway, every back road, and evey interstate. This would take a ridiculous amount of time and money. We are talking billions and billions of dollars and possible two or three decades. I am kaigen, and this is why I'm against a vehicle that can ""drive itself"". Plain and simple they are not safe and would cost far too much to make safe and reasonable.

Apparently, Google has developed a car that literally drives itself! Who wants to worry about puting the car in drive, and wondering if you're driving alright...you'll always be driving great! The google cars ""have driven more than half a million miles without a crash,"" which absolutely amazes me. Safety is a very important issue that I personally worry about often, but with this out of this world invention, I wouldn't ever have to worry about crashing, to an extent. Also, since these cars are basically crash proof, you'll always have a designated driver if you're unable to succesfully drive yourself home.

You always hear about crazy people driving recklessly under the influence, and taking thier lives, taking others lives, and harming themselves and the well-being of innocent bistanders. With this breakthrough car, drunk driving rates would hit rock bottom. People wouldn't have to put others, and themselves in any sort of danger, because you're not the one driving, your car is. Again, safety really plays a gigantic role in these vehicles. These wonder machines also have sensors, so that if for some reason traffic is too much to handle for the smart car, the car will send a vibration through your seat to alert you to take over.

To me, that's the only problem...the cars aren't fully in control. Evidence from the article states, "" Google modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an internal motion sensor."" Seems like alot of sensors! I would really love to nap at the wheel, but it seems as though I would be unable to proceed in doing that. So that is something I would definetely encourage manufacures to establish...no sensors, just pure driverless cars.

These cars are nothing short of amazing, and I can't wait to own one for myself one day. They are safer than your typical car, and also super cool and intereesting. So if you want more safety, and more reliablity, definelty go with the Google cars.        ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

A459492C73CE,"There are both positive and negative aspects of driveless cars. There are reasons on why driveless cars should be on the road. But, there are also reasons on why they should not be on the road. One reason why they should be on the road is because they would use half the fuel of today's taxi. One reason on why they shouldn't be on the road is because they still need a human in the smart car, and that might cause wrecks due to the driver if he/she is not paying attention.

One reason why the smart cars should be on the road is that they are better on fuel. Google cofounder Sergey Brin says that he envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driveless cars form a public-transport taxi system. He also says that the cars he forsees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexibility than a bus. Television and movies have long been fascinated with cars that could drive themselves. Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009.

One reason on why they should not allow driveless cars on the road is the possibility to wreck. The driver still has to remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires. This necessitates the car being ready to quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs. Which sometimes it might not quick enough or the driver might not have enough time to react, which will possibly cause a wreck.

Another reason why they shouldn't allow smart cars is because they will cause more wrecks. Since they can steer, accelertate, and brake themselves, they might not brake in time when they get close to another vehicle. But, they notify the driver when the road requires human skills. They notify the driver when the driver needs to navigate through work zones and around accidents. And, they are better on fuel.

They shouldn't let the driverless cars on the road due to the possibilies of a wreck. Also, they might not give the driver enough time to react. Then, the smart cars require a driver in the vehicle anyways, and they need full attention inside the vehicle. Another reason on why they should ban the vehicles is because the quick change from vehicle to driver would be very quick.",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent

As driverless cars are becoming a new deveoping technology, it's best to ask yourself, ""Are driverless cars really a necessity?"" The answer is, no, they are not a necessity for many reasons. We should not continue to develope driverless cars mainly because; driverless cars are not completely driverless, the car would need a new built-in entertainment system to put inside of the car, and if something were to go wrong with the car, who is to blame for this?

When you hear the words, ""driverless car"" what comes to mind? Perhaps, you think of a car that can take you anywhere, and young teens the age of thirteen not needing an adult to drive them to a desired destination. However, driverless cars are not 100% driverless. In the article, the cars are said to be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, because of this an alert driver is said to still be required. People are still needed to be able to navigate through work zones and around accidents. Manufacturers are still working on creating new ways to alert the driver when human skills are needed, but it is no secret that this will continue to cost money.

Another reason why we should not have driverless cars, is because to have them, companies think a built-in entertainment system should be created, installed and required inside of all driverless vehicals. Today, we already have vehicals that contain a television inside for the passengers who occupy the back seats, to help keeped them entertained. This new entertainment system is said to shut off when the car needs the driver to take over and will not be available to a driver who is texting or using their phone in any way. However, putting in an entertainment system would still be considered a distraction, just the same as if someone were to be using their phone, and the article states drivers will need to remain alert, but they can not remain alert with an entertainment system.

Finally, we should not have driverless cars because, if an accident were to occure, or if something fails, who is to bame for this issue? There are situations where we would not know who to blame, the driver or the manufacturer. We could blame the driver, stating that they should have been paying attention and been alert to stop the accident before it occured. However, we could also blame the car's manufacturer, because they were supposed to build the car and make sure it was not able to fail in the first place.

As you can see, driverless cars could bring more trouble to us than we realize. They are not a necessity, we do not need to use driverless cars as our dominant way of transportation. The article states many positives and negatives aspects of the development of driverless cars.

In the passage ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" they said something about putting something in the car to entertain them and making sure they keep their heads up at all times.

Now they are making this new thing where a car can drive you around itself without you having to take control? Have they thought about the car accidents that could happen? Or how it could injure someone? This will take more responsibility than what a driver has now.

Would there have to be any test taking for those who want their permit or license? How do you know if they are capable of being in control over those things? Having the cars we have now are good enough. Those who want a driverless cars should still capable of doing the things they do now with a regular car. Senors will still be in the cars, if adding them to the new cars that would make it better for the person and the car.

They want to know who would be responsible for an accident? Well it would be the persons fault. If they aren't looking at the road because they were distracted by something else than that could be bad. They should be able to take control when they see something bad is about to happen.

Now if the driverless cars come with speaking instructions that could make things better because you can tell it what to do. If there is traffic and your vechile is going to fast you should be able to tell it to slow down.

It seemed like the only thing we had left to feel like something actually matterd was driving something we've done since the invention of the car. why make something we don't need. I believe it'll cause chaos and misfunctions to this world. This self driving car will let us truly know how lazy we are as humans how to avoid a simple task, of getting out and out of bed. If this car is available by 2020 it'll truly prove that those who get it are truly lazy. Even if it has sensors to keep your eyes on the road.

This car will allow teens and adults to text and drive as freeely becausen they don't have to worry about the possibility that someone will get hurt. this may be a small carbut it can effect thoe around them due to it being self drivng. This self driving car is a bad idea, and worst invention in man kind.

In conclusion, this car can be hurtful to economy, and those who surrond them, it will provide,texting and driving amoung them, an pure laziness. this will be a big distraction for teenagers and adults. though it has it's sensors, it won't ever be good enough.

C6DDF1883511,"My position on driverless cars is that im against the developing of these car because of what they bring. Things like this would probably cause chaos. More than likely to have accidents and whos fault would it be. Some situations with these driverless cars can also be crutial. Im against it because the laws, what wil happen after a accident, and how these things would actually work.

If the law focuses on how safety works and keeping everyone in the car safe, what if theres a malfunction and theres a accident ? Then who will get the blame for it ? The way it will work is if a human driver is in control right, but then the driverless car looses control or has a breakdown who will be affected ? The developer or the ones in the driverless car. The traffic laws are for someone to be in control of the car so therefore it is safe. Maybe a change in laws can solve this problem and conflict that may possibly happen.

Accidents happen daily, so will the driverless decrease the chances of that happening ? In my opinion is that technology goes wrong here and there not always but it happens. If these cars arent deveoped the proper way where theres accidents daily, who gets the blame. I personally think that the developer and the one who had the idea to make this should take a part in it. Why ? Simply because if you took the time to make something so cool and fun, it should also reach state safety laws. When accidents happen and if its the drivers fault they get blamed for it right ? So if this driverless car where there is no driver who get the blame for a injury, the driver or manufacturer.

How will this driverless car even work or be developed. The car is gonna have a sensor input system to take over when in traffic. Sensors arent really the best thing to have because something can cause it to stpo it from working then what happens there. If you still need to be in the driver seat and paying attention to the road what is the purpose of this developement ? It has its own brakes but you can take turns, but cant you do that in a normal car just takes alittle bit more time. This driverless car isnt a bright idea just because of the way it works and the problems it can cause.

Im against it because the laws, accidents and what can possibly happen, and the way this technology might take place. States are gonna have to change safety laws which in some the car needs to be proven to be safe. The accidents and the way things will be faced and who will be blamed is gonna be insane in most peoples opinion. The way technology might take place is also gonna be a factor because it can go wrong if not built right. Therefore im not so convinced about the developing on this driverless car.

02D889D32DF5,"I think it is a bad idea to get a driverless. I feel as if there would be to many people who just would blow off their responsibilitys as a safe driver. I thnk this because they wouldnt be driving the car the car would be driving itself and that would make people pay less attention. But dont get me wrong it would be a nice and amazing idea if we could all be responsible enough and pay attention so that we dont cause accidents. These cars would also help us from accidents because it would be smart enough to know when there is a stop sign or anything like that.

Some things that could ruin this idea would be if you thought about what if they mal-function and the car crashes and seriously hurts someone. Im sure that the cars saftey system as in air bags and other things would become one of the prime resources if it did mal-function. I feel as if more people would trust this car if there was a percent or something on how efficent this car would be.

Some other major problems would be the price range i mean lets be serious no one wants to spend alot of money on a car that isnt worth it. I think if the car was a little cheaper and was alot more reliable on being able to pull over and stop without human work. the part that is good about the car telling the driver to help is it would keep the drivers alot more on the road then they would be if it could stop and pull over all on its own. One more problem i can see about this is there would be alot more texing on the road then is needed which would proabably cause alot more carelessness when people care riving to then would cause more accidents.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Google, the BMW, and more have been trying to create affective driverless cars for everyone to help shape our future for the better. It's been debated for a while, especially with accidents and saftey but in the end it's really just about what's best for us all.

Though not all of the fifty states in America agree with it, Google and other companies have been trying to create and improve our future with something useful; Driverless cars. They've created a car that can steer, break and accelerate on it's own therfore, virtually calling it driverless but, the assistance of a human is still very much needed. In order to make the idea more fun and appealing they've placed entertainment technologies into the cars, which can be very useful at times, but the most important and useful thing about these new cars is their saftey.

Thousands of people all around the world get into automobile accidents everyday. But what if over half, if not more, of all those accidents could be avoided? When it comes to driving, safety is the most important thing there is. With the new driverless cars, that's no longer a big problem. With it's abbility to sense and see everything arround you, it's able to break or accelerate if needed and they have warnings that they give you to help keep you from hurting yourself or inncocent pedestrians and when it's your turn at the wheel it signals you to do so with a special feature, some cars' different than others.

Although it's not completely driverless yet, they're slowly progressing towards that bright future. Just imagine a day where you can wake up and almost never have to worry about anyone getting in a crash again. This eveloution is bringing forth a saffer and more prosperous future for all of us and not all states agree with these terms but i'm sure they will. We all have the same goal, wanting a safer enviornment for us to live in. Their evolving creation of driverless cars is slowly, but surely, helping us get there.",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent

I think these cars could fundamentally change the world, they would need smart roads or smart cars, and also most driving laws focus on keeping people safe. What do you think about driverless cars?

I think these cars could fundamentally change the world, because it's like a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system. The cars that Sergey foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. What do you think about driverless cars?

Without the option of smarter roads, manufactures turned to smarter cars. For example, they needed a whole lot of sensors. Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the review mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. This input combination is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of human beings at the wheel. What do you think about driverless cars?

Most driving laws focus on trying to keep people safe in or out of the car, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers. Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. The negative side i am trying to get at is that if these cars are made and the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault: the driver or the manufacturer? What this is trying to prove is that if there is an accident no one would know who to blame because there is a driver, he's just not in control of the car because it is driverless.

What do you think about driverless cars? I think they could actually be very beneficial to many people in the world. Mnay car companies plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020.

8B24E44082C3,"Driverless cars are a thing of the future, or are they? The Article ¨Driverless Cars Are Coming¨ allows us to believe that maybe thery´re not a thing of the future, but actually a right now present day modification to our way of living.. Now is this a good thing regarding the safety of the common people, I believe so. Does it help or economy, lets discuss and see.

First off the article points out that google has been doing thier test runs since 2009. ¨Their cars have driven more then half a million miles without a crash.¨ No one has been killed in these test runs, and how many have been killed in regular driving since 2009, the number is sad. Driving these cars arent as dangerous as people make them out to be. I would also like ot point out that these cars may be able to dive themselve's, but Google cars arent entirely driverless. They're unable to back out , and navigate through roadworks and accident, so they allert the driver in those situations. The car knows when its unsafe for it to be the one in control of driving so, its going to alert you to take over and get through this. Some of the ways engineers have allowed this is with vibrating seats, and flashing lights in the car. Some have even suggested getting a camera installed inside the car, that way the car knows if your paying attention while you are driving. Next these cars are not made so people can daze off, and text on their phones, or just not do anything in the car. Special sensors in the sterring wheel allow the car to know if you have your hands on the wheel. The cars are designed so that the driver must stay alert while drivig, and ready to jump in when roads require human skills. With all of these necessary precautions in store, and the history of how well Google has managed so far, it´s very safe for the right driver to be behind the wheel of one of these cars.

Its the best option we have economically wise, of changing the world, and advancing the world. Smart roads were investigated, in the 1950's general motors created a consept car that could run on a special test track embedded with an electrical cable that sent radio signals to a reciever at the front end of a car. Again Berkley tried the same thing using magnets and alternating polarity. The smart roads worked very well, but the cost of upgrading all of our roads to fit the criteria was to much of a hit to the economy, the smartest choice was to modify cars so that they could become smart enough to be dirverless. To be safe the cars have a lot of sensors installed into them. The most important sensor having to be LIDAR on the roof of the car. This sensor shootss out a laser beam to form a constantly 3-D model of the cars surroundings. To help the economy its safer to update the cars with these, then to fully update the road systems we have now.

Driverless cars are not a thing of the future, ther're a present day modification to our way of living. They're not anymore dangerous then driving a normal car, and may even be a bit safer. Also they're the best choice econoimcally that our country can provide, to improve our way of living and advance us that much further. So why not get with the new era and drive a driverless car.

301D48946CB9,"Can you really trust a car to take you from point A to point B safely? There are many possible things that can go wrong while a person is not controlling their car. I think that there is not a safe way for a car to drive a person all by itself. If you don't know the next action that your car is going to take, how can you stop anything bad from happening? Will the car be able to determine where to stop if it is approaching a stop sign? There are too many ""what ifs"" with a driverless car for me to feel safe to ride in one, or to even have one driving on the street around me.

To me, there are a variety of things that can go wrong when you are allowing the car drive all by itself. There are too many questions that need to be answerd about these new cars. For example, how will the car react to a sudden change in the environment? If another car gets to close will it swerve out of the way potentionally causing an accident? Even if the car notifies the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, what will happen if the driver isn't notified in time? Also, if one of the sensors on the car were to be broken or damaged, then how could the car continue to drive on its own? Would it notify the driver that a new part is needed? If the car were to get into an accident, who would be to blame, the driver or the company that created the car? Would it depend if it was on manual control or automatic? These questions are the main reasons why the driverless cars need to be improved before I will even think about ridding in one. I know that I would rather know exactly what I am doing and how it will be done instead of having a car try to do it for me.

I think that driverless cars are a terrible idea. There are too many problems that can occur during the driving process, and I don't want my life in the hands of a car that can't see or think the way that a human does. If during some parts of the drive it requires a human to take the wheel, why have it automatically drive you? Wouldn't it get tiring waiting for your turn to drive, especially when you aren't sure when the car is going to have you take over? You must stay focused on the road and have both hands on the wheel, so you could very easliy just drive the car yourself without the worry. This way you can control the situations that you get into, and not having a car get you into trouble that you might not be able to get out of. I think that it is much more safe to have a human that can respond quickly to change and can manuver through obsticals than to have a car, that might not see everything in its environment, drive automatically through it.

It will vibrate your seat. Drivers are either on their phones, messing with the radio, or talking to the passengers. That's not a good thing. It will be if you have a driverless car, because like I said, you will be alerted. You won't be able to speed or get mad and frusterated because the other drivers or not going the speed limit. I know a lot of people that like to drive being on their phone or something. When they do that, they start to run off the street or onto the other lane. You don't want to panic when that happens. When you panic, you wreck. So, it will be a great idea to have a driverless car. It keeps everyone happy and safe. ",2,Driverless cars,Text dependent
872EA0F8C2B1,"On the side of optamism, Driveless cars are a wonderful idea with plenty of potential for humans to once again reach further into the future with our tecnalogy. Imagine only saying or putting in your destination and getting there hands free, its like having a personal driver,but anything that sounds that good has to come along with some downsides.

While the industry of driveless cars is expanding slowly but greatly it is yet to be a fully drawn out plan. The driverless cars of today are only somewhat diverless. Meaning they can stop themselvs or drive short distances but still in certain situations the drivers hand is still greatly needed to avoid harm to not only padestrians but to the ""hands free"" driver as well. Honestly if your hands are needed for certain situations why not just drive fully? If the driver is behind the wheele of a hands free car they will be tempted to do other things with there hands not paying attention to the road at all and we have enough of that with people in self driven cars. That also means that in a situation needing a humans touch would be nothing more than a sudden alarm or vibration going off and needing your reflexes to save either a padestrian or your own life like a quick time event in a videogame. The huge difference is if something goes wrong there are no second chances.

Another issue that could be of concern is as much as technalogy is well loved and how most devote their lives to it, it isn't perfect there are mis haps and incidents that tech causes everyday but though the driveless car idea seems like a good one the tech behind it could not be reliable causing possibly a number of problems. If accidents and shut downs things of that nature are to happen who is at fault the owner who signed the contract to own such car. Or the manufacturer who's faulty equipment could've caused the issue in the first place?

In conclusion the idea of a totally driveless car is ideal. It might even be a necesity for some but until the project is fully finnished and has proven itself to be a great, safe, and dependable form of transportation we should be warry of how fast we say here take my money. One day the Driveless car could become a huge industry all on its own shaping itself into the next big thing but for now, lets stick to driving ourselvs around in the mean time.

FE9E14F641F8,"Automakers are progressing closer and closer to bringing fantasy and reality together by creating the driverless car. Many people debate whether they should be legal, or if they even have any real use to the world. The driverless car is not a practical option for the world to turn to.

To allow technology to completely overrun our lives and to go on ""auto-pilot"" for the rest of one's life, would do much more harm than good. The driverless car will allow drivers to essentially ignore the road and their surroundings during their trip. Though the manufacturers may warn consumers to be alert during their ride, one must find it pointless to pay for an automatic car, when they may have a normal car that requires a slightly higher level of attention. One must fear that for going on ""auto-pilot"" for so long, the people may forget how to drive properly.

When these cars get in an accident, there will be a law suit between the driver and the manufacturer. If the car gets in an accident caused by the car itself, then the manufacturer will have ""wrecked"" it's reputation, and hopefully will be forced to recall every autonomous car of that model, which would be extremely expensive fpr the company to do. To add to that, these cars will be far too expensive for consumers to be worth all of the legal and insurance hassle that would be attached to it.

Finally, one should find that the automatic car would disconnect their emotional connection to their normal car. Tthe automatic car takes the fun out of driving, making the task seem to be a mundane way to get from point A to point B. The automatic car would steal one's confidence in having control over where their going, which also means drivers would do less ""taking the long way home"" and more ""get me to where I'm going"".

In conclusion, the automatic car is not going to become the future of driving. In American society, people have emotional relationships with their cars, and the automatic car would not fill in that gap. For the people that would go for the automatic car would become unaware of their surroundings, and frankly would be set on auto-pilot for so long, that one fears that they may forget how to drive properly. In the end, the automatic car may be good to some, but inpractical and inflexibole to many, but no one knows what the future may hold",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

E4F518EFCAEE,"Im for driverless car , becasue i believe that it would make driving alot more safe for people and would let people know whats happening before it happens. it saves money too. the reason i say ir saves money is becasue it would be better on fuel . ""use half he fuel of todays taxis."" it would be both more safe for the driver and the other person becasue it alerts the driver when something is about to happen or if it needs human skills to move through an area.

They started creating and thinking about driverless cars late 1950's , the first concpet car was made by general motors , the car ran on a special test track that allowed the car to follow it . another company tried a similare thing , but it worked with magnets in the road. so instead of the techonolgy begin in the car it was in the road , the system worked well , but it would be to expensive to replace all the current roads with this new one . It wouldnt be praticial for anybody.

Now the concpets of driverless cars arent that far away because of all the techonoly we have now in the world. Google modifeid the Toyota prius . They use sensors on the left wheel to position it , it has a rotatiing sensors on the roof, video camrea mounted on the rear , it has four automotive radar sensors , and a intertial sensor. All the techonoly i just named off helps the car be aware of its surrondings. the rotating sensor on the roof makes a 3-D model of the cars surrondings to keeps track whats going on. the driverless car mimics the skills of a humam at the wheel. The driversless cars are not fully without need of human skill, in diffcult or dangerous sistutation the car will alret the driver to take hold of the wheel and move through it . The car stills requires the human to remain alret the whole time while in the car .

The only problem with dreverless cars is that most law makers do not know if it is more safe with driverless cars or with humans drivers. Law makers know that the safety is best when they have alret drivers. Since lawmakers think that driverless cars are illegal in most states , expect for California , Nevada,Flordia , and the District of Columbia. Those states though hae limityed use of semi-autonoues cars. Most manufactures believe that more states will follow with the others one once they assure them that they ae reiably safe. Another thing is needed once the say its legal, they would have to make new laws just incase someone does get into an accdient. who would be liable for the acceident , the car or the human behind the streeing wheel.

The facts and states i put above in the beggignig and middle paragraps are the reason i believe driverless cars would be more safe. They have the techonolgy to keep us alert and safe at all times.

First off the time you use to drive all the way down to Florida is about 12-18 hours. Lets say someone is going there for their job that 12-18 hours could be used for all sorts of things like making up for you job while your away or just finshing a project you did for this meet. It would be a great way to use your time instead of having to drive. This could be an amazing break through for somepeople who have to travel many times for their job.

Secondly, if we have only driverless cars all driving they would know how to react to each other. This inturn would get rid of driver error such as drivers getting angry at each other. Another example would be cars speeding past each other, which cause recks. Driverless cars could bring down the death toll from car crashs every year by getting rid of driver error.

Finally, a big problem today is drunk driving. If we had driverless cars the drunk drivers would never have to touch the wheel making the roads safer. The car its self could never get drug or slow down its reaction speed making it safer than with someone above .08. This could also bring down the death toll, for drunk driving crashs every year.

These are all reasons i believe that we could be better of with driverless cars. It may cost more and their might be problems at first but in the long run it could save many of lives.

I would think that the developers would wait for awhile just to make sure that nothing major could happen with the car whenever it is out on the roads and hopefully wont cause damage. Some people might be fascinated with cars that could drive themselves but it could be dangerous because without a human operating the vehicle it could crash and damage our community.

Some positive reasons for having driverless cars is that it would be easier and better for people to have them. In movies, they have driverless cars which people think are really cool. If they have driverless cars in the future and something goes wrong, they have sensors so that the driver knows if there is a problem and they have drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger, which is a great thing to have, especially if you almost back into an object or another car. Using a driverless car could also be a new way to actually make driving a vehicle fun.

If the driveless car developers wait for another 10 to 20 years on having them on the road, it would be better and much safer because the more time they spend working on them the better it will be and the less problems and damage there will be.

If you use mapping on a driverless car, it might not work as well as you might think because what would you do if it gets the address wrong and ends up taking you to the wrong place.

Also Modern cars have much better fuel economy and lower emissions than older, driver reliant vehicles. Crash rates will go down so there will be less debris on the road. Human error is also something that will become a thing of the past.

With time and research, cars can easily become smarter than a human. Humans lose attention on the roads, develope road rage, and brake the law frequently. These are all things that could lead to a fatal crash. For example, ""Further improvments in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own.""

B552732A859A,"I find that driverless cars is not only a bad idea but a bad advocate, I also find that this car is a bad avocate for not only teenagers but adults as well. Although the car does seem cool because it is something new doesn't mean it won't malfunction while being used at anytime. People would have to take extra procausion while using this type of car. I could see more accidents in the future rather than safe driving.

The main reason I find that driverless cars is a bad idea is because of drunk driving. Teens and adults already take full advantage of it so why wouldn't this car advocate more drunk driving? Not only on top of cars malfunctioning, you have to pay extra procausion, and plus on top of all that someone decides to drink and drive. People don't understand all of the responsiblities you have to take on while having a driverless car.

As to many teens they like to show off, a lot. That is something everyone likes to do, but imagine all the horrific things that driverless cars could cause. It only takes one person to get distracted by their cellphone or other passangers in the car. Something could happen to the car in just a short period of time, The car could malfunction but the driver responsible wouldn't know or they didn't have enough time to stop the car or give their attention to the road.

In my opinion I believe that driverless cars should be banned from every state. Driving isn't just about getting to your destiniation, but keeping drivers, passenger, and pedestrians safe. Only alert drivers would be in the proper state to drive one of these cars but teens and other drivers that aren't very alert and are already not safe drivers and could cause many problems.

4A5FD95B6D72,"I do not think that there should be driverless cars. Driverless cars still need a driver in them. They also can drive around or know if a road is getting fixed. The cars could also be dangerous. These are reason why i think we should no have driverless cars.

First reason why we should have driverless cars, is because they cars still need to have a driver in them. The car should not be conicered driverless if they still need a driver to take over just in case of an accident ahead. The cars also do not have eyes can not see, how will it work at night. Also during the winter the driverless cars would have a lot of accidents because of snow and ice.

Second reason, is the cars would not know when there is a dead end or the roads are getting fixed. These cars could run off the road if a bridge was not complete. The computer hardware could go down in the middle of driving and people could died. These cars are not humans, and could kill lots of people because of simple mistakes.

My final reason is these cars can be dangerous because how would they know when children are running through the streets. These cars would not be safe around children or eldery people. In the article its says ""If the technology fails and someone was injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufactuer?"". How will the law handle situtations like these, who would be at fault they would not know.

I do not think they should be driverless cars for many reasons. There are also, some good reason why we could have them. A couple reason are they dont use as much gas, they do thing that humans can not do, but these cars can be dangerous to the community. i think that there should not be driverless cars, and cars should say how they are.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
E2681EA8C42A,"Automated vehicles are nice and all, but when it comes donw to it, ahuman should be responsible for his or her own actions on the road. The use of automated automotives just seems to be a liitle too risky to use on roads within the next few years. Automated automobiles might sound like a good idea in theory, but technology fails all of the time and I would not be surprised whatsoever if lawsuits sprung up in the near future, due to accidents caused by so-called ""smart"" cars. There are currently no laws regarding smart cars, smart cars are unreliable, and smart cars would not offer the same experience as a normal vehicle would.

One would assume that driverless cars are 100% safe. That is a very false statement, as drivers may still take control of the wheel. Who is to say that a driver would not just grab the wheel, drive off of the side of the road, and attempt to sue a car manufacturer for a faulty product? There are little to no laws regarding self-automated vehicles in most states. New sets of laws and other rules would have to be put in place in order to maintain peace between civilians and car manufacturers. Paragraph #9 states that new laws would have to be made in order to assure liability to a specific party if one got in a crash due to the smart cars. It seems highly impractical, and it also seems like a waste of precious time and money.

Smart cars may sound very safe and enjoyable in theory, but all technology has the capability to fail at any given moment. Imagine a world where driverless cars are simply rolling along down the streets, and perhaps one combusts here, or another veers off of the road there. Paragraph #7 talks about how some cars are only partially automated, and that is honestly the best way to handle the situation. A driver should still be responsible and should be able to make his/her own decisions on what to do on the road. There are dangers in this as well, because some people are not bright enough to use and understand the technology to its full advantage, and could cause problems in the process of maintaining the vehicle. If a vehicle has multiple sensors scattered around its body, those sensors can be tampered with and can malifunction; whether it be intentional, or a simple mistake, accidents do occur on the road.

There is no experience in the world like driving a car. Kids look forward to it their whole lives! Girls will get cars on their 16th or 17th birthday and SURPRISE! YOU DO NOT ACTUALLY GET TO DRIVE IT! A computer will do it for you! To me, that does not sound appealing or very fun in the slightest sense. Imagine sitting at the sterring wheel and dozing off, due to the fact that you have not had to touch the sterring wheel in miles. Dozing off at the wheel could be a fatal experience. Making drivers operate a vehicle is much safer than allowing a computer to do so, because it should be the choice of the driver as to what happens on the road. In paragraph #8, a psychologist states that automated vehicles could cause drivers at the wheel to get bored. Boredom leads to weariness, which will eventually lead to sleep, which in turn could result in a fatal accident to the driver, a passenger, or pedestrians/cyclist. If someone did not want to drive or take responibilty for it, they could have someone else drive, they could ride a train, or fly in an airplane! It just seems so unrealistic and kind of ridiculous that someone would actually want to be driven by a machine. If a person owns a car, they should be responsible for managing it and whatever occurs on the open road.

There is no practical use for smart cars in a modern day society. Perhaps in the future, when technology is more advanced and when the people of the world are even more brain dead than they currently are, we could have smart cars driving people freely throughout the streets. Smart cars will never live up to the security and safety measures of vehicles operated by a human driver. Smart cars are a lot more trouble than they seem to be worth. Smart cars would require new laws, maintenace and regular repair (so a malifunction may not occur), and trust in a machine that could fail at any given moment. Smart cars will only make the human mind much more lazy, and we will continue to degress as a society if we allow smart cars to become our preferred mode of transportation.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
BE400D3E9018,"Driverless cars would not be a good idea for our society to convert to. A car without a driver would be more dangerous. It would also not be as mentally stimulating as actually driving is. It would lead to laziness. There would also be more accidents.

Driverless cars would be detrimental to our society. Cars without dirvers would not be safe and would lead to more accidents. Without an actual thinking human behind the wheel, anything could go worong. There could be a system malfunction that could result in the deaths of many people. Driverless cars would also not be as mentally healthy as driving a real car is. Driverless cars would not be mentally stimulating at all. Sure, the car may be able to provide entertainment for the driver, but that is nothing compared to the mental benefit of driving. Driving requires you to think about your actions, whereas simply being entertained does not. Not driving your own car would also lead to more laziness. If humans stop having the energy to just drive their own car, then what comes next? We stop walking and breathing on our own too? Driverless cars would just push us closer to doing nothing for ourselves and relying on technology completely.

Driverless cars are something that our society needs to avoid. They would cause many more injuries and accidents than our current cars do. They would not be mentally healthy. They would urge our society to become even more dependent on technology than we already are. Overall, driverless cars would just be detrimental.   ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
FAE077D9355F,"Personally i am for driverless cars because with these cars if a accident were to ever occur the car would prevent it from happening which would prevent lots of deaths from texting and driveing from hit an runs. It would also keep the driver protected and also other drivers on the road protected. And also the sensors on the car modify when you are to close to a object or are going to hit a object before it is going to happen. And also the dubbed LIDAR use laser beams to form a constant updateing 3-D model of the car's surroundings with this combination the input is necessary for the driverless to mimic the real skill of a human at the wheel. And with the assistance and help of google the GPS his able to connect to google maps to navigate the driverless car to it's destination. With the sensors on and in the car drivers assistance isnt a problem, with the antilock brakes the is willing to stop when something is blocking it or is comeing at it with a equal speed. With more roadside assistance from google you can connect your cell phone to the car and answer the phone as you please and still be able to safely drive on the road.

With some of the assistance there is another added one its called ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" the car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 miles per hour, but the special touch sensors makes sure the driver keeps hold of wheel. But not any of the cars made today so far has not accomplished makeing cars competely driverless they can break themselves, steer and also accelerate and all this tecnology keeps driver notified when on the road.

The car cant do all this on its on it needs human skill and assistance at the wheel along with it. Such as steering and working its way through work zones and getting its way around accidents. But the human at the wheel must be paying attiention and alert to whats ahead of him or her. And when a situation occurs it must require human assistance.

The human does not have complete control on stopping the vehacle. GM has a special development , when ever the vehicle is in danger or is backing up into a object the seat vibrates. and when the vehicle cant manage somthing the human can it announces the human should take over and it sends other ways and signals the driver another way if not seen that way. there is also another way to keep the driver focused on the road and to make sure there are cameras watching the driver to make sure the drivers remain focuesed on the road, while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver.

automakers and manufactuers have devolped a new and fun way to make driver pay attiention to the road and to keep the driver safe they will continue makeing these changes to the automoblies today and in many more years to come. they have predicted that in 2020 cars be able to drive on autopilot 90 percent of the time. but only time willl tell and get us closer to inovate more technology each decade.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Also, if the car does start to break down and the signals don't go off, what will have to that humand driver and other passagers? Will ther be insurance for them? Will it happen to other cars? And what happens when other people found out what happened to the car the broke down and caused an accident? Because I doubt they are going to want to keep driving that driverless car. These are things the manufacturers have to watch out for and many others.

I am not say I don't like that idea of a driverless car, I am just saying that they need to put everyting that can happen into concerteration. Not everyone is going to want a driverless car. Some people are going to want to keep their human driven cars. But I do thing it can be done and it will be done, someday in the near future.

Therefore, driverless cars are not impossible, but I don't think that today is that day is the day. We need to research ever possiblity before it happens. We also need to get othe peoples oppinion on this, such as the elderly. So yes, I do think think driverless cars are a good idea, and hopefully one day soon they will be a part of this world.

C2DB3C695BCF,"My argument for the development of the driverless cars is that we should have them. These cars should be allowed to be made, they can become really helpful to people. They can also provide really good safety features. The diverless car will help the environment, it will spend less of our natrual resources that we use. These cars will change the way our future will look like.

First of all, the diverless cars will help tons of people around the world. Think of all the handicap people on this earth who can't drive. These cars will change their lives. They can travel by their selfs, instead of people picking them up to go places. There might be people who become drunk or injured and they need to go to their house or hopistal. With these cars they can get there.

Second, the driverless car can provide really good safety features. The cars will have a lot of sensors. When Google modifed their Toyota Prius, they use position-estimating senosors, rotating sensors, video cameras, four automotive radar sensors, etc. They put all theses thing on a car to make it safe and to drive on its own. The driverless car can have all these features to be a very safe car to drive.

Last, the driverless cars will help the environment and will spend less of our natrual resources. A Google cofounder Sergey Brin says, that the cars he foresees would use half the fuel of taday's taxis and offer far more flexiblity than a bus. These driverless cars provide less car accidents. With less accidents people won't get killed or injured.

The driverless car will aslo provide less money of fuel.

8F587DDC5E0D,"Driverless cars are a bad idea for a couple of reasons. People may begin to become naive while driving, start being a victim in more wrecks, and be in danger of losing safety. Do we really want to put people's lives in danger just so we don't have to drive and can be lazy?

The first reason is that people may become naive and try to sleep while driving because they will believe you do not have to drive at all. This is wrong because in the passage it states that you do have to drive whenever the car needs human help and can not complete a certain action such as driving through roadwork zone or accidents. The name of the car is a false advertisement if you don't read into it.

Another reason is if a person gets in a wreck while in this car would it be considerd the person's fault or the manufacturers? If the person is not driving then it would be the manufacturers for a malfunction in the car. This will put these manufacturers at a place where they will have to pay for damage and insurance to whoever was wrecked into and fix the problem. If this happens to more than one person people may not buy the car or from the company of the car anymore. As stated in the passage there are no rules currently about these driveless cars and there would have to be a new set of rules that would need to be made. Many states are forbidding them completeley and you can't even test drive computer driven cars.

My last reason is that these cars are not completely safe. In paragraph eight it states that drivers may get bored waiting on their turn to drive. This could result in people falling asleep and playing on their phones when they should, at all times, keep their eyes on the road. Anything could happen at any time and it could be unexpected. The cars do not seem incredibly safe for anybody to drive.

I would not reccomend this car for anybody. However if you are older and wiser and know what you are doing this could be the car for you. You will just need to be so much more aware of your surroundings and make sure that you are always paying attention. These cars require a lot more responsiblity than a normal car would. So when looking to buy a driverless car consider all of these points. And in the end, is it really worth it?",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
58DEF94A4FAB,"Driverless cars are a futuristic thing that everyone has always been dreaming of. They are cars that can drive themselves while the passangers just relax and sit. Now, although this may seem like a very good and helpful thing us humans could use, it has its problems. Which is why i think we should not have driverless cars.

One of the reasons that I believe we should not have driverless cars is because a lot of taxi drivers would lose their jobs. Even though in the passage it says that it would use

""half the fuel of todays taxis"". If the cab drivers lose their jobs, we could patentially be hurting a family. Although it does not seem like a very big issue it is still a problem that comes with the car. Unemployment rates are already low. Having people lose jobs due to a car? It doesnt seem very fair to struggling families.

Another reason i believe we should not have driverless cars is, its patentially more dangerous. Even though the car could have more knowledge of what to do, because thats what it was made for. See the problem here is that with all of the computers involved with the car it is easy for hackers to hack into them. If a hacker messes with the computer software it could really mess up what the car was designed to do. If someones computer in the car starts to glitch and fails while driving this will end badly. Multiple wrecks could happen all at once. Just like the passage says ""if the technology fails and someone is injured who is at fault"".

One argument a person could use is that the cars would have more knowledge about driving than an actual person would, which could be helpful in reducing car accidents. People drive wrecklessly all the time. Which yes, this is true. Think about the future though. If we have only driverless cars in the future no one would even have the slightest idea on how to drive. I am sure they would at least get the basics of driving but what if one day the computers just fail and the internet is no longer of use? People who are on the road when this could occure may die. With with this kind of problem, their would be far more fatalities than a couple of wreckless drivers on the road.

In conclusion I believe that we should stick to our regular cars. So many things can go wrong with driverless cars. Wrecks could happen, and many people could die. Although even with regular driving fatalities can happen I just think it would be much safer to stick to our regular cars.        ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
FAB4AD7890A9,"In the year 2032, and a new product is talked about all around the world: in homes, buisnesses, schools, and churches. For several days, many people gabble about the aspects of a car that drives itself and is safer than most cars with excitement and jauntiness.

For many people, this anecdote is the ideal future and one that will hopefully happen soon. Development of automated cars should be funded and researched more thoroughly because automated cars make roads safer, are more luxurious for the passenger, and are not completly driverless.

In ""Driverless Cars are Coming"", the author states ""Google has had cars tha could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009. Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash"". Because of this fact, cars are safer. Automated cars have radars, and sensors all around them to know where the cars are at any given time. this includes the LIDAR which creates a 3D model of its surroundings, making the entire experience safer and causing less deaths each year. in 2013, BMW developed a car which can go up to twenty five miles per hour if the driver keeps his or her hands on the steering wheel, adding to the safety features on these new cars.

Another reason why these cars are fundable and should be reashered more is the fact that the new car rides would be more fun for the passengers. For example, these cars would have displays that let people watch movies and play video games. The moniters turn off when danger is afoot, which adds to the safety features on the new automated car.

For people who are still worried that the cars will be unsafe because a computer can't decide what a human can and can't perform complex actions, do not fear. Automated cars will not be devoid of human interaction. According to paragraph seven of ""Driverless Cars are Coming"", ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are deesigned to notify the river when the road ahead requires human skills.""

The new cars have also been designed to warn passengers to oncoming dangers by vibrating, speaking, or flashing lights when danger in near by. GM has developed a car which vibrates a driver's seat if his or her car is going to his an object behind them. This creates a car to human relationship that insures cars on the road are safer and cause less deaths per year.

In conlusion, automated cars are the future. They are safer, more relaxing, and are not completely automated. The future is looking bright for thse new cars. People should expect new and exciting cars to not drive in the near future.             ",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
9411BF4CF714,"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" it talks about how different companies are making cars that can be driven with no driver, but some have made ones that are almost driverless. Some companies used different ways to achieve that goal but some failed. In some states you cannot even test out driveless cars. There is an arguement wether people agree or disagree with the car. There are both positive and negatives of driverless cars.

There is a positive side to having driverless cars and one of them is that it will use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer more flexability than a bus. There are cars with sensors so if you come close to a pole or something it will make a noise so you can stop before you hit it. The sensors will also be able to control the breakes and reduce the power of the engine. That will create a better response and control than a human driver. It will be much more safer if we have driverless cars because if a perosn is texting and forgets to stop the car, it will stop itself not causing any accidents.

There is always a negative side to everything and the negetive side to this is that if we rely too much on technology to do everthing for us then we will not know what to do once it fails us. Lets say that we finally have driverless cars and there is an accident ahead, but the car does not stop. At that point what will we do? We will not be able to stop the car because we forgot how to use one after all these years relying on the technology. Like it said in the article, if the technology fails and someone gets injured whose fault is it? It said in the article that some cars are partly driveless except when going up or down driveways or going past an accident so at that point the drivers have to take control. We will all still have to learn how drive.

We should go against the development of these cars because at some point all technology might fail. It may seem safer to have the driveless cars, but I think that if cars have sensors to prevent some things then that will be fine. We cannot rely too much on technoloy even though it is extremely useful. Technology has helped us save lives in the past years. There is more negatives than positives so in that case I believe that we should not allow driverless cars. ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
C706F9D46394,"I am against the development of driverless cars for many reasons. Personally I feel as though people are starting to get more and more lazy these days with the help of technology. I believe it would be much more safe for someone to manually drive a car, rather than put your trust into a computer. There is a wide range of possibilities that could go wrong with driverless cars out on the roads.

My first reason is that the car could malfunction. Whoever programmed the car could have messed up and gave the car a defect. Then someone would buy that defected car and most likely get into a crash. Someone could be on a highway while the car system fails, crashing into a semi truck. Theres a possibility that the car could completely shut off, leaving you stranded in the middle of nowhere. Also GPS these days isn't very reliable, the car could take you completely off route trying to follow GPS.

My second reason is that someone could hack your cars system. Somebody that strongly dislikes you could get in your car and ruin its system. Even worse, people would start paying a hacker to destroy car systems. While you're out on the road relaxing in your driverless car, a hacker could take control of your car giving it directions. That means while your stuck in your car, someone is in control of your life deciding if they want to crash your car.

My third reason is that it's not very safe. I don't think putting all of your trust into a vehicle is a very smart idea. The sensor on the car could go out with your knowledge, causing it to crash. There could be road construction that the car is not aware of, potentially driving straight into the construction site. Your city might have certain driving regulatons that the car won't know about, which could give you a ticket from a cop.

My fourth reason is that you could be put at a higher risk of getting in a car accident. What if a little boy is getting his ball in the road? The car might not see him with the sensors, causing the car to drive right into the boy. You could be texting on your phone and then out of no where a car is comming right towards you. It's too late to gain control of the car because you were so busy texting, resulting in a car crash. Maybe you're tired so you take a nap while your car is on its way to the casino. Your car could crash at any moment, because you're not awake and not paying attention to the road.

In conclusion, there are multiple reasons why a driverless car wouldn't be safe. whether it's due to a malfunction, hacker, or even safety issues driverless cars are not safe.

I just don't see to much to offer besides a car that is just a waste of time on the road for everyone else. They have to test the car to be better and I understand that it's just that maybe we're not ready for cars like this so soon. As time goes on humans are more dependant on technology and we can't do that forever sometimes it's good for us to not rely on it so much. With cars we drive ourselves around and are alwayed focused on the road and what's around us at all times we become more alert in a way. Now with self driving cars we sort of loose that awareness of being alert all the time while on the road.

This idea is another great idea to keep the crash records down but it doesn't change the fact that humans almost everyday depend on everything to do something for us no matter how simple it is.

I believe that self-driving cars would be pretty amazing technology. But when it comes down to it, how trustworthy are they? Considering the fact that you're leaving your safety to a computer. What problems could arise? A few problems for a self driving car are that it could have a malfunction, it could cost more too repair, and who do you blame on a crash if it were to happen?

Your car could easily have a malfunction. Maybe the gps could take you to the wrong location and you're in a hurry. Maybe it could not drive how it's supposed to. It could go to the other side or the road or run off the road. A self-driving car could possibly cause crashes. This goes back with leaving your safety, your children's safety, your family's safety with a computer.

A self-driving car could cost more to repair than a normal car. These cars would have to all have built-in gps systems, sensors to know what's around them, and sensors to know if there is something on the windshield. Since normal cars have drivers to manually do all this stuff, it only makes sense for all this to be very expensive. Extra parts that are not in a normal car could cost more to replace since they are not in as high demand.

Who do you blame on a crash if it happens? Nobody will know for sure. Is it the other drivers fault or is it the maufacturer of the self-driving car's fault? These are all major if questions. Also, if you are injured in a crash, who will be around to call the ambulance if you're alone and unable to get to a phone? These cars just seem too dangerous and too risky to trust.

CDF6072AB1D6,"The Case of the Driveless Cars

How many movies have you seen that depict the future with advanced technology such as holograms or even driveless cars? How much of a reality could that be? The case of driveless cars has been something that has been going on for awhile. Even around 2009 Google came out with their first almost driveless car. Although driveless cars are depicted as futuristic and magical, really driveless cars seem like more of an endangerment to our economy, our safety and our time.

To begin, the manufacturing of driveless cars is insanely expensive. Where would all this money even come from? We would have to fund it to provide research for a car that doesn't know how to back out of a driveway yet. There has already been 200 million dollars spent on radar a device on a hiltop. So why waste money on something that only goes up to 25 mph and won't even drive if you don't have your hands on the wheel? It seems like driveless really just means assissting. But assissting to who? Obviously not the wallets of the buyers.

Secondly, the driveless cars are supposed to help for the better of the people, they say it would be ""safer"". But where is the proof that it is safer? Many states have already banned the use of any self-autonomous cars, just leaving out four states who have left them limited use to test out the cars. How can the world just expect for these cars to be safe when we already have superstition over these cars and those who don't will barely let them use the cars too? They also suggest since the driver will probably be bored that they should put in some entertainment in the car. But what happens when, the car stops and has the driver do what they're supposed to, but they aren't prepared because they were entertained by something else? It's unsafe to assume that having all these distracting things around people who are supposed to be driving won't effect how they do in a sudden situation. There is also the hastle of having to reconstruct the roads, which goes back to the point of money and also safety. It is never safe when there is construction going around, especially when they have to reconstruct the whole road in order to make the driveless cars work. This also leads to the third point.

Time is very limited in this day and age. We barely have time to do anything, we have so many errands to run, so many things to do, but it's like we never have enough time. If the expansion of driveless cars would continue we would have to reconstruct the roads, delaying many people with getting to work or going to school, or just everyday things. Then we have to go to the government too, to repeal the ban put over on many states. So, naturally, that will take forever too, because when does the government ever get such controversial things solved super quick? Why waste the time of millions for something we aren't sure of yet?

All in all, the manufacturing of driveless cars is pointless when the car isn't even really driveless.

22C6C0356324,"The progression in the development of driverless cars is not a recomendable idea and would do more harm than good for drivers. With self-driven cars, drivers would become lazy and unfocused in their driving. The development of such cars would not only pose threat at every turn for the passengers of a car, but would also deprive drivers everywhere of basic driving skills and knowledge.

The main reason that driverless cars would be a danger to society is simply that they are electric, and malfunctions occur in technology frequently. It is stated in paragraph 7 that the vehicles would be equipped with ""driver's seats that vibrate"" or ""flashing lights on the windshield"" to warn the driver of upcomming terrain that the car would not be able to maneuver on its own. The problem in this is that if a battery were to go out in the flashing lights or the vibrating seats malfunctioned, the driver would not be alerted of the forthcoming danger, and a crash would be innevitable.

Another threat posed by the innovative vehicles is the driver becoming too comfortable in the vehicle. When the driver places all of his trust into an electronic to keep him safe, he loses his focus and edge needed to be prepared for potential dangers on the road ahead. If another car or other unexpected object, such as a deer, were to pull out infont of an electronic vehicle suddenly and without warning, the chances of said vehicle stopping on its own are slim to none. In paragraph 8, ""in-car entertainment"" is promised to ""'interpret the fun of driving in a new way'"". Including in-car entertainment to drivers is doing nothing but promoting distracted driving. It is included in the article that this form of entertainment would be safer than texting and driving because the system would shut itslef off when the driver of the car was needed. This claim leaves a great amount of room for error, such as the fact that people often fall asleep while watching a show or movie because they feel relaxed, so it is innevitable that this would also happen to a driver being distracted. A self-driven car would be promotting laziness and unawarness in drivers and would lead to more crashes because of this.

The development of a driverless car is not a logical idea for numerous reasons. Drivers would be more likely to become distracted from the road and from doing their job as a driver in a car that only partially required their attention. A self-driven car would be unreliable and unsafe to the driver, passenger(s), and others around the car. Cars were designed to be driven by a driver, and manufacturing them to be driven by themselves is encouraging people to place their trust and safety into something that is not dependable and reliable. To conclude, producing a vehicle that is self-driven will promote drivers being lacidasical and unfocused, and will thus lead to more crashes and failures on the road.

Within a few years there have been many new inventions that have completely revolutinized the way we live. Some people like the new ideas that are brought up and some don't. It all depends on who has a purpose to use it. The idea of cars that can drive themselves have came up and have some scratching their heads. Many do not want to have one of these cars and the developers are trying to find ways to improve them. As they continue to test them and see if they are ready to be sold to the public, the public can only wait and see how this will turn out.

Vehicles have been improved year by year and there always seems to be a new model that comes out and is said to be the 'best' that has ever been made. The people want them and no matter what, there are always some things that bug the owners. As new models come out, the prices of the vehicles go up. Just imagine the price of a new car that is able to drive itself. We have no idea how the cars will affect our everyday life and what changes it will bring as well. I personally believe that these brand new cars will not be a good thing to have. It could cause anger and we could only imagine the price to get one repaired if it were to be in some sort of accident. With a slow limited speed, it would cause the other drivers on the road who drive normal cars to be very aggrivated. The weather also brings up a new con in the public's mind as we wonder how the car will run in something such as snow or heavy rain. The car is drives itself until it reaches things like moving past an accident and moving through work zones. It may have the driver bored out of their mind, waiting for their turn on the wheel and has people wondering if others are able to be in the car with them. Could the car cause accidents and will be available to all who are able to afford it? There are so many new ideas that can have positive and very negative affects.

There are still many questions that stay in our heads that we want to be answered. The car still has some time until it is publically released, but we are all anxious to see what this vehicle will do to our lives.    ",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent
1400B6BD2346,"Are driverless cars safe? A new invention of cars have been created which allows you to drive without necessarly driving. In many ways this is a smart and creative way of thinking. Though it does have some negative sides to it. Though in some cases I would argue for the developement of these cars.

In many cases driverless cars are more useful and environment friendly. It would use half of the fuel used today by most cars and offers more flexibility than a bus. Even though they are considered ""driverless"" they still require the same amount of attention as you would if you were actually driving. Some of these cars have been tested and can drive more than half a million miles without a crash which is higher than average vehicle which can travel less and is more likely to crash. These inventions do the samething any normal vehicle would do, they can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. This means that it could give driver a break to relax while stil focusing on the road. The individual gives all prioritites to the car itself but when the driverless car senses that it there is something ahead or near that it cannot do by itself it will alert the driver. The car has things such as vibrating seats and flashing lights on the windshield to alert the driver.

Not only does the driverless car drive by itself with the help of some human skills but it also helps with safety issues. The driverless car has a invention of sensors that are on the far which are said to ""Allow far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" The built in software can cause the car to apply brakes and reduce power from the engine when it detects out-of-control skids or rollovers. Also it can allow drivers to do thinks such as text and drive without having the safety issue of recking because the driverless car is driving for them and can alert the indvidual when he or she needs to take over.

Although the driverless cars have both positive and negative aspects about it there are far more positive things to say. It allows drivers safer than any human could possibly driver and it also also the driver to have a break while still being able to focus on the road. While the only negative concern is if you wreak. Therefore driverless cars have proven that they are a good and safe invention.",4,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Many people enjoy driving and being in control, and driverless cars would take this feeling away from them. Additionally, I would not feel as safe in a world with driverless cars. Especially when they are first available, driverless cars would only endanger everyone around them. Their mechanics or sensors could suddenly fail at any time. Also, it will take a while for the manufacturers to perfect the cars, so therefore these cars will be even more hazardous at first. In addition, I am positive the computer geniuses out there would surely find a way to hack and take control of the cars somehow and commit murders. Detectives may not be able to find out who is committing such awful crimes, considering it could be anyone, and it would not take much effort. Furthermore, driverless cars will be completely pointless; the driver will always have to keep a close eye on what the car is doing and make sure it does not do anything wrong. What is the point of driverless cars if they are not actually driverless? I understand numerous car wrecks are happening currently because some people just do not pay attention, and everyone wants the number of wrecks reduced, but driverless cars will not help whatsoever. People will continue to be distracted by their phones and other electronics and think that since they are not controlling the car, they do not have to watch the road. This is a mistake. If people stop watching the road altogether, more wrecks will occur. Mistakes will always be made.

Personally i think it's great that they are bing able to make this advanced of technology to possibly build a vehicle that you don't have to drive, but i think it's better that a perosn drives a car.

I think it is better becasue driving a car keeps the person more sharp at the mind and aware of the things around them.

Although this would be a great idea to keep down the risk of drunk driving casualities a year.

To me I am honestly neuatral on the whole idea with driverless cars, but I can visualize how the cars can be good for society, and i can see how they could create major problems too.

The passage shares two easily argumentable sides of the story, The more postiive side being that there is an advancement in technology and that They would use half of the fuel we use now and would be better for public transportation.

Althought the cars themselves can also create some problems.

They talk aout how some of the cars arn't truely driverless yet and can't manuver around things such as road blocks, difficult traffic situations, and construction and have to alert the driver to take over.

Some people don't see the point in that and bring up the arguement wouldn't people get bored waiting for their turn to drive?

Honesty, I believe that the person would get bored and that there can be more cons that outweigh the pros when comes to the idea of the road laws and what would happen to someone if the car malfunctions. Do they blame it on the individual or the manufacturer?

I think they should wait on proceding to put out the invention of drivless cars until they are fully certain that they have everything they need to make the car safe and reliable for the road conditions.

There are many things that are great with the idea of the drivless car, but i also think that there are many things that weigh down the idea for now.

1DC257172C29,"Driverless cars should not be developed. The cars still need the help of people to perform some activities. The cars also will have millions of sensors that at any one point if one goes bad the whole car would not be able to function properly. Driving also requires the driver to be alert at all times. Driverless cars are going to have ways to entertain the driver instead of keeping the driver focused on the task at hand. With all of these potential problems driverless cars should not be developed.

The cars can brake and go on their own to help the person driving. They also vibrate when you are about to back into something or are drifting into another lane, but they can not correct these things. Some cars can drive themselves but can not function properly when coming to a roadwork area or an accident scene. If a car is incapable of dealing with these contingencies we should not develop them.

Cars that can drive themselves need millions of censors just to stay on the road let alone the lane. In paragraph 4 the prompt talks about the cars using LIDAR which is a device that projects a laser and spins on top of the car. Every rotation showing the computer the cars surroundings. While on the road however the LIDAR could spin around and before it get around again an object could have found its way to being in the path of the car giving the car, depending on its speed, hardly any or no time to react. Other sensors could go bad or just the slightest miscalculation or glitch in anything could spell disaster for the car and its passenger(s). These cars should not be developed given today's unreliable technology.

In paragraph 8 the questions, ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"" and, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"", were asked. In the same paragraph the author answers the question by saying, ""We have to interpret the driving fun in new way."" Manufacturers hope to fix that problem by introducing ""in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.""(Paragraph 8) These same ideas contradict the claim in paragraph 9 that says, ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best acieved with alert drivers."" How can drivers be alert if they are busy ""having fun"" before the car decides to hand over the controls to the driver. Driverless cars are just going to cause more accidents due to the lack of attention the drivers are giving the road.

Driverless cars should not be developed because they still require human assistance, there are too many things that can go wrong with the technology required, and that driving takes alert drivers, the same drivers that are going to be ""entertained"" while they wait for their turn to drive.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent

Driverless takes all of future injuries away. Self-driving cars are safer because it has more sensors related to what the passage stated in paragraph 5.

You won't necessarily be driving but assisting the car even though the car drives on its own. That doesn't mean you may text on your phone even though your not driving, you will still need to pay attention and alerted just in case. Like, if there is a car accident, work zone, or if you are putting the vehicle into reverse, that would require human driving skills like the passage stated in paragraph 7. Car seats will vibrate if there a object behind the while reversing the car.

All in all, I believe driveless cars is a outstanding idea to infer. Its a problem solved before it occured.

It could either positively or negatively change society. The passage talks about the pros and cons of driverless cars. But there are not many negative things about these cars. I believe that driverless cars would be a good thing for our society.

In the passage it says that driverless cars have not had any accidents or crashes while testing them for over half a million miles. This shows that these cars are safe and there are still being more improvements made to make the cars even more safe. It also talks about how these cars would save money which is a good thing for everyone because we could use the money for other important things. Personally, I am running late often which is not a very good thing but these cars could help anyone who is in a rush and needs more time to finish something because they would not be the ones driving. You would just need to be prepared to take control of the car at any time in case the car needs human skills to accomplish something. The cars can break, steer, and accelerate by themselves but they still need help from a human driver when it requires human skills. Which means you still have to be paying attention to the road which is really one of the only bad things about this car.

These cars are safe, save money, and help you finish things that needs to be done by giving you time in the car to do it. The cars would truly benefit you.

I know some people would love not to have to drive cars around and that's all well and good, but what people don't understand is that driverless cars are dangerous in my opinion. I would rather be safe driving in a car, than to be riding in the car with no driver

Body:

Let's just say that if someone driving a regular car and someone were in a driverless car, it would be the person in the driverless cars fault. Why? Because they don't think they did anything wrong and that they're following the driving laws. I don't think the person that was actually driving in the normal car is at fault, they may seem old fashioned but at least its safer.

Being the cofounder of the Google company doesn't mean you know everything, especially about transportation. This is just an idea but it doesn't mean it should actually happen. I understand that some people love cars that drive for them now but at least they still have steering power. I do however like that cars can brake for you when you're not paying attention. And I know that even driving in normal cars is dangerous, but its much safer being behind the wheel than to be just sitting in the car doing nothing.

Driving shouldn't be fun. It should be about learning, and to me learning isn't very fun. Driving to me should be a symbol of growing up not so you can go pick up your friends and go out. Maybe on some occasions, but overall its just a means of transportation from one place to another. But hey, this is just my point of view.

Conclusion:

Some people may not agree and call me crazy, but at least I know I'll be safe when I'm actually being the steering wheel. I would rather not see so many people in the hospital or dead because they wanted to not have to drive to their destination on their own. Driving isn't a terrible thing, it's when people start getting fed up is the terrible thing. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
87FC88069466,"I believe that the use of driverless cars is a decent idea, although it does have it's downsides. The idea of drivers and passengers not having to drive themselves would provide a luxury feel to most participants in the driverless car ""movement."" This could also help with very common safety issues: texting while driving, intoxicated while driving, or just flat out not paying attention.

In paragraph 10, we see that not only is the driverless car and idea, it's happening. If these manufacturers are still running on track, then we should start to see the sprout of driverless cars this year. This implys that people need to start thinking and making decisions on whether they want to sit back and let a computer do the work or not. While I can see the problem of boredom, stated in paragraph 8, I think that this would empower the driver more. He/she would be able to kick and and enjoy the ride without paying 100 percent of their undivided attention to the road. Long trips and vacations would be made much easier with this, or even for truck drivers who drive late at night.

The United States has been exposed to a large amount of deaths from texting while driving, this could be the end of that. While they would still need to pay slight attention to the warning signals given that they need to grab the wheel, if the driver picked up his/her phone while a computer drove them around, it wouldn't be too bad. Another issue imposed on drivers is being intoxicated and driving. This would also be solved with a driverless car. The driver wouldn't pose a danger to themselves or the passengers in the vehicle if being almost chauffered around. This however could still be an issue if the car needed the driver to take control.

I believe that a driverless car would most definitely benefit drivers everywhere. It could solve many issues that stand due to full attention driving and would cut the death rate from car accidents by a large chunk. ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
CF3423ED7018,"In my opinion i think that having driverless cars is a good idea. Many people are very distracted during car rides and do not know how to pay attention to the road. Having drivereless cars will be a good thing for the community becuase it can help nervous drivers get through traffic safetly, help stop texting and driving, and it notifies people of their surrounding so that they will not run into things while driving.

Driveless cars allow people to be notified of their surrounding so that they will not run into things. For example, "" GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object."" This feauture allows the driver to know when it should stop reversing by adding vibrations to your seat so that they will not hit anything. When the driver feels the vibration it will know that there is an object neerby and it is necessary for them to stop. This will cause less accidents and make it safer for people to drive. The "" blind spot"" while driving will not longer be a problem while driving because you will now have a sensor that tells you when you are to close to an object making it safer to drive.

A lot of people text and drive or talk on the phone while driving even if they know it is not the safe thing to do. The driveless car has a feature called"" In-car entertainment and information system"" that allows people to do this while not putting there life in danger. The text states, "" Some manufaturers hope to bring in car intertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over- something not available to drivers trying to text with a cell phone"" People will have the opportunity to text while the car is driving but as soon as the car is in need of the driver it will take away the feauture so that the driver will not be texting while driving so that will not be putting their life or other peoples life in danger.

The driveless car has a ""Trafic Jam Assistant"". Some people get really nervous while driving in traffic causing them to get overwhemled and maybe even cause an accident. The "" Traffic Jam Assistant"" can help stop that by helping get through traffic safely. For example, "" Traffic Jam Assistance .. The car can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph, but special touch sensors make sure that the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" This feauture will allow drivers some assistance getting through traffic jams. Going at 25 mhp, and sensors that allow it to detect objects near by traffic jams will no longer be a scary experience for drivers.

I think that driveless cars are good for the future. It will help nervous drivers get through traffic jams easily, notify people of their surroundings to make sure they do not crash into things, and help stop texting and driving accidents. People live busy and hectic lives and sometimes driving under stress is not safe. The driveless car will help make less accidents for people and a safer driving experience for everyone.

People can't trust cars to drive themselves because the car itself can't handle some human sitituations like pulling in and out the driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues. The cars are going to be to expensive anyways because not everyone on Earth is making enough money to buy one of these cars.

The cars might be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but they all rely on the driver to navigate through work zones and around accidents.

Why want a driverless car that still needs a driver,and if it is driverless its not like you can go send it to go pick up someone. It might be fun or cool to have a driverless car, but its not safe.

It also feeds those lazy teenagers as they rarely want to move or do anything that requires activity. I am deffinetly for driverless cars

Driverless cars are not exactly ready to be manufactered because there are some things cars cannot do that the driver would have to do for them. In paragraph 2 it says that cars that exsist today aren fully driverless because they alert you in tricky situations, like pulling in and out of driveways, or dealing with complicated traffic issues. Certainly this is just a minor problem compared to the actual driving part, and is planned to be figured out in the near future.

BMW made an outbreak in 2013 when they announced the deleopment of their ¨Traffic Jam Assistant¨. This vehicle can drive at speeds up to 25 mph, but there are special sensors that make it mandatory for the driver to keep both hands on the wheel at all time. Human drivers must remain alert, which makes it safer for those around them if something were to go wrong. Cars are alerting the drivers by vibrating seats, and light sflashing on the windsheild, catching the attention of the driver.

Although it would be very helpful and easier for everyone to have a driverless car, it could also be more dangerous. Of course the cars would alert us when we need to take the wheel, but most of the population is involved in their cell phones, what if someone ignores it, or misses the alert of signal? This is why as of now, most states have a law against being able to even test computer-driven cars. Why is everyone slowly relying on technology to do all our work?

Car companies have big plans for the future. In parapgraph 10 it states that Tesla has projected a 2016 reliese for a car capable of driving on autopiolet 90 percent if the time. Other companies such as Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and NIssan plan to have driverless cars in the year 2020.

A smart car can have a technical difficulty and cause an accident and the fault could be said to be the drivers when it never was. This can bring conflict with the driver and the company of the car which can lead to bad consiquences. The car should not be developed becuase it can have techincal difficulties, have a high cost, they take away the fun of driving and learning.

Smart cars should not be deveploed becuase it can fail on something and have techincal difficutlies. The car may not sense something around its surroundings and won't be able to alert the driver on time causing an accident. It can also have failing on the GPS and go a wrong way. The worst casesenerio would be the steering wheel locking and the driver would not be able to control the car if something was to happen. Smart cars may seem smart and safe but technology doesn't always work how it is suppose too.

Another reason why smart cars would not be a good developement would be the cost of the car. The car may be very high at price and wouldnt sell. It could also get a huge donation to get the car started but that money could be a waste by not having a successful project. The car could need something new and it could turn out to be very expensive and won't get fixed being left alone. The car may also need a special street to give it eletrical signal which would be expensive to remake new streets. Smart cars may just be a waste of money.

Another reason for not developing smart cars is we loose the fun in driving and learning. As a teen, people get excited because they get a new oppurtunity to learn and practice something new. We learn the basics of driving and learn from it. We get more freedom to do things and to go to places. But having a smart car can take that away. A teen won't learn from a mistake they do by not driving and correcting themselves. All a person would do is sit there and wait if anything happens. But a teen can have no knowledge in driving and won't know what to do. And as teens we can easily get distracted and cause an accident if we don't pay attention.

In conclusion, smart cars shouldn not be deveoloped. A smart car may sound smart and safe but when it comes to the real world technology can mess up and cause accidents. A human being should always have control of its own thibgs that being their life or their car. A smart car's technology can mess up, be very hight at price, and it can take away the fun of driving and learning. Smart cars should not control our driving, we ourselfs should.

8FA4E8D0E37B,"Driverless Cars Good or Bad

Can you imagine a time in the future where no one buys cars because no one needs them anymore? Well I couldnt imagine a future without buying cars. To buy a car is what mostly what everyone wishes for. Yes there is no technology coming up and by the years it expands more and more each day, but not because of that means that getting the idea of enventing cars that drive themselves is good.

I am against future cars the drive themselves because first there not even proven all the way safe. These cars can get out of control any day and something bad can happen. In the story it says that states will follow as soon as the cars proved more reliably safe, which means that there not all the way safe. Anything can happen and when the driver has control of the driving they know what there doing. The driver knows if there driving right or wrong, But how will these cars that drive themselves know. Imagine one day the system might not work and the car will automatically fail with the system. These cars are'nt safe and until there not proven safe I am againts it.

The next big reason why I""m against it is all the money there going to watse on these cars just to make them and when they come out. Theres going to be millions possibly millions of dollars to make these cars. Instead of focusing on something like this we can focus on bigger things. We already have cars we can drive we dont need to be expanding and wasting money on things that are'nt as important. Just more tax money coming out of people things will keep pricing up. Theres no point to invent cars to the next level if cars we have now are good enough.

My last reason on why I'm against these cars is the when you drive its freedom. Its a priviledge to drive, and when you drive you feel free. If the future brings cars that drive themselves the freedom of the people will be gone. So bringing cars that drive themselves wouldn't be so great for people who love to drive because they wouldn't feel free. Therefore cars are good just where they are.

Eventhough some may argue that having cars that drive themselves is good for whatever reson they might think, I'm against. So, can you imagine the future were no one needs to buy cars anymore?

Its to risky to have a car drive by its self. Because what if you fall in hard sleep and you get to a work zone. Your going to get in a wreck. Thats putting other people in danger.

What if the sensors mess up and just stops working. BOOM wreck right there.

Theres also good reasons for the driveless car. You can play on your phone because you dont have to watch the road. There would be less wrecks because there is alot of wrecks becuase people are playing on there phone and trying to drive at the same time Or you can do you make-up when you are running late to work or a meeting. You also can save gas. If you save gas more money you have.

If you going on a road trip and you tired just take alittle nap. But they need to put a loud alarm in the car so when you need to drive you will be able to get up and drive when you need to. There would be less people falling asleep behind the wheel and getting in to wrecks.

My conclusion is that the driveless car is both helpful but dangeres at the same time. But I think there spend to much money on them when they could be working on the cars you have tyo drive yourself because those dont work properly either. There always a problem with them so what makes them think that the driveless car will work better?",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
36D263A9ECC7,"What Would Our Country Yet The World Be Like With Driverless Cars ? Having Driverless Cars Would Have Both Positive And Negative Aspects . Driverless Cars Would Be Positive Aspects Due To The Fact That They Use Half The Feul Of Today's Taxis , They Offer Far More Flexibility Than A Bus Would , And Many Other Aspects . Driverless Cars Would Have Negative Aspects Do To The Fact That The Driverless Cars Can Not Navigate Work Zones Or Go Around Accidents Without A Driver .

My First Reason , That They Use Half The Feul Of Today's Taxis , Is Because Who Wants To Keep Causing Global Warming By The Gases That Come Out Of Your Car ? In Order To Even Have Driverless Cars We Have To Have An Earth To Keep Them On . Global Warming Is Basically Over Heating Our Earth And Is Caused By Many Things Including The Gases That Come From Cars . Using Half The Fuel Of Today's Cars For A Far More Better Transportation Sounds Pretty Good To Me .

My Second Reason , They Offer Far More Flexiblity Than A Bus , Is Because Buses Have Certain Routes And They Hold More Than One Person . I Assume That The Driverless Car Would Be A Mix Of A Bus And A Taxi Not Physically Though . Meaning It Would Pick You Up Wherever You Are Like A Bus And Taxi But It Would Drop You Off At An Exact Location Like A Taxi . Only Its A Far More Upadated Version Meaning Its Takes Half The gass We Use Not & Can Do & Go More Places Then Buses .

But Driverless Cars Have Some Negative Aspects As Well . One reason That They Are Negative Is Because They Cant Navigate Work Zones Without A Driver. So If Your Riding In A Driverless Car It Doesnt Know Where Work Sites Would Be Causing Traffic Jams And Maybe Even Crashes . Everyone Wants To Know Whether Their Drive Home Will Be Safe Or Not . Because There Is No Way For You To Inform A Driverless Car That Work Zones Are Ahead If They Dont Have A Driver .

Last But Not Least A Driverless Car Is Not Able To Go Around Accidents Without A Driver . This Means That The Driverless Car Would Either Do Three Things If Confronted By A Accident . It Would Either Cause A Big Traffic Jam , Cause Another Accident , Or Even Cause Angry Citizens . Everyone Knows An Angry Citize Is Not A Nice Citizen. Then If There Is Already A Traffic Jam Due To The First Accident And A Driverless Care Cant Get Around It , That Would Cause A Huge Traffic Jam .

All In All Those Were My Reasons Why Driverless Cars Are Both Positive And Negative Aspectd . The Positive Aspects Would Be That It Uses Half The Feul Of Today's Taxis And It Offers far More Flexibility Than A Bus . The Negative Aspects Would Be That They Cant Go Around Work Zones Or Accidents Without A Driver .        ",3,Driverless cars,Text dependent
6CFA4016F75F,"In today's world, people often strive for the next technological innovation. As a result, various companies in the technology industry are attempting to develop driverless cars. However, the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"" manifests that the technology is not beneficial. Driverless cars should not be developed because this technology is in reality unrealistic and can potentially lead to liability issues.

The idea of a driverless car may seem compelling, but driverless cars are not truly driverless as humans must always take some control of the car. For example, in paragraph seven of ""Driverless Cars are Coming,"" the author indicates that BMW's developing driverless car has ""special touch sensors"" to ""make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel."" Since the driver is required to keep his or her hands on the steering wheel, this car is not truly driverless as one might think. Though it may perform some functions of driving on its own, a driver must always be there for special cases. The author furthers this idea in the same paragraph by saying that ""none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" As a result, the author, too, indicates that these developing driverless cars still require drivers. Since not even one of these developing projects does not require a driver, the author indicates that truly not requiring a driver is an unrealistic technology. Thus, one of the biggest attractions of driverless cars, the lack of necessity of a driver, is lost. The author later supports this in paragraph eight by asking, ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"" This question suggests that driverless cars still requiring drivers are no longer as attractive. People would no longer want driverless cars as much. As driverless cars are not truly driverless, as their name suggests, they should not be developed. The technology that would fulfill what the name suggests is simply unrealistic. Also, driverless cars require an inefficient change since they require such a large change in how traffic control works.

Driverless cars are such a large step into the future that changing laws to deal with them are inefficient. The author indicates in paragraph nine that ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that they only safe car has a human driver in control at all times"" but that ""new laws will be needed"" with the advent of driverless cars. Since the current laws regarding traffic only deal with cars driven by humans, having to rewrite the laws to deal with cars driven primarily by computers is inefficient. This is such a drastic change in the laws that it would truly take much time and capital to rewrite everything. In a society that revolves around cars driven by humans, this presents an unrealistic change in how traffic is controlled. As a result of the inefficience of changing the entire system, the development of driverless cars should be halted. Furthermore, the new laws may struggle with the liability of accidents, another reason why driverless cars would be a negative innovation.

The widespread use of driverless cars means that the liability of accidents is extremely difficult to determine. Paragraph nine poses the question, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" This indicates that a society with driverless cars may struggle with this issue. When an accident with these cars would occur, it would be difficult to determine whether the owner of the car or the manufacturer should take responsibility for the accident. The car would be the owner's possession, but the accident may also be caused by poor manufacturing or programming. As a result, any decision that poses one party as responsible for the incident may lead to conflicts, as either side might hold a portion of the blame. As a result, it is best to avoid such difficult situations by stopping the development of these cars.

Truly driverless cars are both unlikely and harmful to society. Though the idea of a world in which transport is dominated by autonomous machines is attractive, the advantages are underwhelming and the consequences are harmful. Society must not promote the development of these cars. Placing such high hopes in this risky technology will only disappoint.",5,Driverless cars,Text dependent
55664500EFAA,"I am for the devlopment of these cars . Why , because in the articele it says that the cars a being created to be more smarter . Such as having senors to tell people and when not to stop and go . Or when they turn at the wrong time it sensors them to stop . They are becoming more safer , as a car . Also for the people driving the car .

Aslo . it says that Google has had cars that could drive independently , under specific conditions since the year 2009 . Cars have driven mopre than half a million miles , without crashing as it states in parapgraph two . The google cars aren't techinally driverless . But, they still alert the driver when to pull out the drive way or dealing with any trafic issues , like roadworks or other car accients or accidents periods .

Since they had no option for smarter roads , they turned to smarter cars as it states in paragraph two . In paragraph two it also says that they used sensors and other technology such as : sensors on the left rear wheel , a roatatinf sensor on the roof , a video camera mounted near the rerview , and etc . With all of those pieces of technology the driverless car can mimic the skill of a human at the wheel .

Senors are nothing new to the world of course . In the 80s it states in paragraph 5 that , "" auntomakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation on antilock brakes "" . Over the years the sensors for cars just got more ,and more advanced . As they got more advanced within the 10 years , they have been used to dectect and respond to the danger and out on control skids and rollovers . In paragraph 5 it says that if they're futher more improvements in the sensors and computer hardware and software for making driving safer then there will be leading cars that can handle more and more driving task on their own .

In conclusion , i agree with the devolpment for cars . There is so much information that I've seen in the article .It tells me how safe cars have been and will be in the future if they make any more improvents for the sensors on the cars and etc . They have more techinally other than the senosor , for the car to be more safe . It says in the article that their have been fewer accidents since the senor has been improved .

50DD653D6378,"Driverless cars would have never crossed our mind 50 years ago, but today, they are already being developed and tested. Driverless cars are wrong beacuse they could cause a lot more accidents from technology malfunctions, they could potentially cause many law suits and problems in our world, and they will make humans even more technology dependent and incapable of taking care of themselves if somehow we lost all electricity and had to operate cars by ourselves.

Driverless cars are owned and operated by the company who makes them, humans have little to no control on what happens in the car. So if the car crashes, would it be the manufacturers fault or the humans fault? Driverless cars could potentially cause many unneccesary arguments and law suits between manufacturers and consumers. If someone is riding in the driverless car, and the car crashes, the manufacturers should be the ones to blame unless they develop a technology to enable the humans to take complete control if neccesary. Many arguments could be made that the manufacturer didn't program the car correctly anf that is why the person was injured or even so much as killed. This could result in manufacturers of big companies paying millions maybe even billions of dollars in law suits.

Driverless cars could cause a lot more accidents because there isn't someone physically watching the surroundings of the car, and technology as simple as calculators can malfunction sometimes, so would you really trust a car run by a computer with your life? Driverless cars have no human physically driving unless it enables the human to drive, and even then it will be hard to avoid the accident because the car wouldn't inform the human about the incident unles just milliseconds before it happens because they can't predict the future and neither can we. The amount of accidents would most likely skyrocket if driverless cars became an everyday thing because of the lack of control and responsibilty a human has in the car.

Today we have many different things that involve technology. We have phones that we depend on for almost everything we do in life, we have computers which we use to store information, we have calculators so we don't even have to remember how to do simple math on our own. Almost everything we do in life has some sort of technology to make our lives easier. Now we might not even have to drive our own car. Driverless cars could mean that people never have to learn how to drive, and then what would happen if for some reason the world lost all electricity, wifi, and communication signals? That means no more phones computers, calculators, and no driverless cars. People are so dependent on technology today that giving them another thing to be dependent on to not have to drive themselves is going to cause a lot of problems if the world has an extreme crisis. Hardly anyone would know how to drive, which means very little transportation and it will be ahrder to communicate with people.

Driverless cars should be illegal because it could potentially cause ven more uneeded law suits and arguments, it could cause a lot more deaths in car accidents, and it would make people very uneducated on how to get places if the technology somehow stopped working. The world is just fine driving themselves, and on top of everything else we depend on technology for, it would be nice to keep at least one thing we have to do for ourselves just for the sake of human independency. If we create driverless cars, we will truly not have anything left to do for ourselves and there will be extreme crisises if something were to happen to our electricity.
